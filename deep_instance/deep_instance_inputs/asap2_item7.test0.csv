18906,0,"she is shelfish. she only thought about herself and money. maybe we can find a way to do things diferently, a way better for you."

18915,0,she has too many emotions
18923,0,AN THE ATHOUR IS RIGHT MONEY DOESNT BUY HAPPYNEST
18925,0,"Rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless.  This is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why.  You feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it.  Rose is talking to Ana at the time that this trait exposes itself.  It says, She tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her.  This is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about Papa leaving to go  to Los Angeles.  She is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support Paul through college."
18926,0,Rose is very stressed because of this essay. She just needed to take her mind off of the essay. In the end she wasn't thinking about the essay and her Aunt helped her firgure out  title by not really even helping her.
18929,0,"If I had to use one trait to describe Rose from this story, I would say she is overwhelmed. In this story, I could tell by her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders. For example, when Aunt Kolab says '... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' and Rose nods."
18930,0,Well Rose is upset because of her essay and Anna tries to confort her like any sister would and Rose is angry.
18931,0,"Rose has forgotten how to care for others, by only looking towards the future and forgetting the present. From being over worked in the persuit of raising money for her brother she has lost sight of her sister and how to care for her. Here in this passage she directly ignores her sister, ' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said' (Paragraph 7 Line 1)."
18933,0,"Her distress defines her as a character.  She is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family.  I drew this from her Aunt's response to the dream, when she said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?', a question  she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt."
18934,0,"rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation. for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that, thats a good opportunity for her family."
18935,0,Rose can be described by being stressed. In the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another.

18938,0,"In the passage Rose is feeling weighed down by her family because she has to work and go to school just to be able for her family to live a some what normal life. In her conversation with Anna, Anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in. She doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job. Anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings. In Anna and Rose's conversation 'Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything' 'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This reveals that even though Rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school, but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon."
18943,0,She feels that everything will get better and her sister should appericate what she has. It says 'When Pual finishes college he'll pay for us to go to college.

I noticed her maturity when her Aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family. Rose didn't reply because she didn't want to hurt her Aunt. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, but also understand her families situation. At her age, this shows maturity."

18993,0,Rose is faithful. She is faithful because she doesn't want to hurt anyone in her family. She does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do. In the story the aunt askes 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help thins family?'  and Rose didn't answer because the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesn't want to hurt anyone. Rose is a good person.
18994,0,"Rose acts like she is resentful to her family. When she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day, it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work. She goes to school, then to work at a restraunt, then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner."
18998,0,"In the story Rose seems to be overworked. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was tim to do homework.'"

19005,0,One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister Anna would be she sounds like she wants to be in charge of her sister Anna. Rose acts like a mother figure to Anna. One example from the passage would be when Anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said 'You sound just like mama'.

Rose thinks she is the underdog in the family.

19020,0,'You sound just like Mama.'
19023,0,Rose is sad. She misses her dad very much.
19025,0,"When rose had woke up and ask anna was sh eok, then she told her s he had fell asleep on her essay again."
19026,0,"Rose is a very realistic person. In the last paragraph from the story she opens up to her aunt a little to let her know how stressed out she is. Her aunt offers other alternatives to making money and this is good for Rose. Although Rose knows its a good opprotunity, she does not get her hopes up because she knows that everything might not get better for her or her family. This shows she is realistic because she has hope, but she also knows the reality of the situation might not allow things to be improved."
19027,0,Rose is takes in to thougth to what her aunt said to change her thoughts that nothing would surely work out. 'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't . But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'

19109,0,"She has a habbit of over reacting and thinking bad about a lot of stuff. She needs to just calm down and stuff will turn out well like its supposse to.

Like when she's talking to her sister and she says 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years'. Well it just seems like she doesn't think she can do anymore until he comes back. Also, if she writes the 300 word essay she has a chance to go to Sacramento but then she says my boss is already mad at me and i would more likly get fired. Well right then is where she's giving up.

19229,0,"Based on the conversations Rose had with Anna and Aunt Kolab you can tel that she is very soft spoken, as well as shy.

Both of these help convey Rose's shy and soft spoken personality trait."
19230,0,"She suppressed her feelings until she couldn't keep them inside her any more. When she talked to Anna, she made everything sound fine, but she really missed her father too."
19231,0,"In the story I feel like Rose was a very realistic person. I think this because when Rose discussed the topic about their father not being around with Anna, Rose knew he was gone for a reason to help his family and she knew that was how things had to be to support their family."

19242,0,"Rose is a respectfull being. She is worried about how her sister, Anna, is feeling when she walks in rubbing her eyes."
19243,0,"Rose's character, I believe, can be summed up in a short few sentences between her and her sister Anna. In paragraph 10, sentence 2, Anna states that in her opinion, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose's feelings towards this statement are quite obvious with her response in paragraph 11, sentence 1: 'Only if  you already have everything.' Here, we can interpret from her words, that Anna feels money, especially in her family's case, is quite important. She feels that money usually is very important, unless you have everything else. In this sentence, we can see a glimpse of how Rose feels about the dependancy of money when it comes to the outcome of her and her sister's futures."

Rose's Aunt wants rose to realize that no matter how hard her life may seem at any time, theres always going to be a little light at the end of the darkest tunnel that Rose will face. All Aunt Kolab want to do is find the easiest way to make Anna feel better about her conflict.

19264,0,She's a dreamer. She had a dream.
19267,0,"Rose is very sentimental. She takes on the role of being Anna's mom when their real mom isn't there. After Rose realizes that Anna is very upset whie walking in to the room, Rose immediatly asks Anna what is wrong and tries to comfort her."
19269,0,"Exausted, I think this is a great trait to decribe Anna because she is exausted with having to work and go to school in order to support her family in the best way she can. One example from the passage is when she has her is talking to her Aunt Kolab, and she asks her if she feels wieghted down. She doesn't reply to try not to make her Aunt feel disappointed with her."
19273,0,Rose tell her aunt how busy and stress she is. Rose tell how her problem relates to her dream.

19280,0,"Rose is a conflicted character. She feels weighed down by all she has to do to help her family and herself. She has to help pay for her brothers education and has to work on her education too.      'In the dark Rose clasped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'"
19281,0,"Anna cares about her family very much.  Her sister and her don't always get along but they will try to work things out.     It said that she rolled her eyes, pushed her chair away from the table, stoodup and stalked out of the kitchen is a good way to explain that they don'talways get along"
19283,0,Rose is an outgoing person. Even though Anna is upset that her father had to leave and her mother is working late Rose tries to make it seem better by saying that their fathers pay is being tripled.
19286,0,She was scared to tell her ant the truth so she asked her a question instead of just coming out with what she needed to say. So I can say that she is lonesome or does not trust any one with her feelings. it shows this in paragragh 19

19306,0,Rose is a Mysterious person because she is keeping secrets that her Family should know.
19307,0,"Rose is very tired and sick. She feels very weighed down and stressed. Rose is a very respectful, helping person. In the story Rose states she has to go to school, go to the restaurant for a four-hour shift, then head home to cook dinner, and finally get her homework done. She feels as if everyone relies on her and she is keepin the family together. Papa left for Los Angeles years ago to earn more money. It's hurt the family alot."
19308,0,She has a lot to take care of. Because she is talkin about always doing somthing.

19315,0,"she is tierd, she is always just waking up"
19316,0,"Rose can be described as conservative in the stroy. This is shown through the fact that she is very conservative in her thoughts about the family difficulties involving money. By being conservative with her thoughts, she proves that the family is more important to her than her own personal well being. This is shown in the conversation that Rose has with Anna when Rose plays off the entire family problem as if it were not a large deal to her, when in reality she was worried and frightened by their family's problems and is experiencing many internal conflicts that are rooted in the family's problems."
19321,0,That you can tell that she is very upset in a way.

She tries saying it in a nice way to protect her sister from feeling lonely and like no one cares about her.
19333,0,smart with a great imagination but she is troubled
