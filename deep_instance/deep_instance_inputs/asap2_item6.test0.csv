Another example is the cell wall of a plant cell which gives the call structure but also gives protction. A cell will also go through osmosis which is the process of bringing in water to the cell quickly. If nessicary a cell can use active transport to bring in nutrients that it normally would not use but at the time it needs.

16306,0,"The cells use the lysomes, cell membranes, and the cell wall if you are a plant cell.  They also use their fluids or plasmas to move things around the cell.  The cell membrane allows things to go in and out of the cell.  The lysomes help send important things to other parts of the cell.  The cell wall is used much like the cell membrane, but for plants."

16310,0,They have a cell membrane which allows the cell to keep unwanted organisms out of the cell. It also has some small openings which can only be passed through by specialized organisms. Finally it has structures that act as gateways and require an activation energy toll to pass through the cell membrane.

16324,0,One type is diffusion. This is where the cell absorbs nutrients through the cell wall. Transcription is another. Transcription is where the cell allows water to pass through the cell.
16325,0,"1. They have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell. 2. Most cells contain a nucleus, which is like a brain, that controls what needs to be done. The nucleus also controls the ER which exports protiens. So only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell. 3. Cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor. This allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise."
