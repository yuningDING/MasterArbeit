21876,0,The effect that it had was question. The reson for that is he wondered why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about it.

21916,0,The effect the background infromation has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard had reading problems as a child and he turned to track and became very good at it and thinks that track could also help Paul out a lot in life too.
21929,0,"The information that Paul gets, is recieved in small bits and pieces.  Not until he researches Mr. Leonard does he find out that he was a college track star, who set records in college.  Finding out these things really helped Paul in many diferent areas. Finding out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read was a big part of that."
21931,0,Paul didn't understand why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his records or achivments in college until Mr. Leonard told him about his life and how he was not very good at reading.
21932,0,He gets background information of Mr. Leonard that he put his mind to the test and if he doesnt do what he says he gets mad until he does what he is supposed to be doing all that the teacher wants him to do is to be a better person and to learn how to do other things then just learn how to read when he still has along time to worry about how to read.
21933,0,Paul feels as if he should get on the team for the school and do good for Mr. Leonard because Mr. Leonard gave him lessons on how to do it. Also Paul feels as if he wins it will make Mr. Leonard feel accomplished and very proud.
21935,0,Paul learns that hard work can help him get to go to college. Paul is glad that he knew the tutors could help him.
21939,0,The effect that the background information had on Paul was nothing it was to just to try to scare him but it didn't work. Mr. Leonard was a very good and nice teacher.

He wondered way Mr. Leonard asked his name that first day after seeing his pass for 2 weeks. He found out that Me. Leonard's grade were bad and that he didn't make it through collage. That's why Mr. Leonard cared so much about Paul getting his grades up and being involved in something.
21948,0,It shows that Mr. Leonard wants to see a person who had the same issues as he did succeed. Mr. Leonard knew that Paul could be better because he actually got help for his reading and could make the grades while being a star athlete.
21949,0,Paul found out that Mr. Leonards background as a track coach in college by the URL website.
21951,0,Then effect the information had on Paul was a curious one.  In the story Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his college experience doing hurdles. But the background information also showed Paul that Mr. Leonard knew what he was doing
21955,0,It teaches him to not give up in high school and to not flunk out. He wants him to do good and get a scholarship to a good college.

21957,0,"The effect is to make paul better at school ,because even though he might be a great runner you can't be in a sport with bad grades and Mr.Leonard found that out the hard way when he was in college.He lost his scholarship and flunked out because he coukldnt read."
21959,0,Because Paul Flunked college so its gonna be hard on him to play a sport an be a pro or anything like that causes he didnt do well in college.
21960,0,"Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, when he broke records. Mr. Leonard explaind that he when he went to college there was not a learning center where he could get help to read. He relied on his friends in high school, but college work is a lot harder than the high school work. there was tutors to help him,but they did not help him. No college school wants a runner when the runner cannot read."
21961,0,HE HAVE TO LEAVE CLASS EARLY AND HAVE TO GO AND GET TEXTED EVER TO WEEKS.

And Pual didn't understand because Mr. Leonard had gone to college. So in the end Pual help Mr. Leonard start trainging agian."
21973,0,PAUL MAY NOT THINK THAT MR. LEONARD IS A GOOD ENOUGH ATHLETE AND A GOOD COACH.
21974,0,They got him to jump over a huedle.
21975,0,In this story Mr.Leonard looks and see how he is going to be like. He keep askingh stuff about him. He also stay in the staiwell because he kniows taht Paul leaves classes early eveyday because he knew thathe cant leave. So he follow him and mad sure that he has help to read and he is a teacher that helps people with problems.
21979,0,Paul thinks of that background information is not a big deal because Paul is less woried about Mr. Leonard than himself.
21984,0,Mr. Leonard was a track star but had trouble reading and had flucked out of college and lost his scolarship for track. It affected Paul because he too has trouble reading and has fallin in love with track. It shows paul that if he doesnt buckle down and get on track with his reading he could lose something that actually means something to him.

22023,0,That he was a track star in collige.
22024,0,It helped because its information and any information normally helps or clears things up.
22033,0,Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he used to jump over the hurdels in college and Paul has enough confidents that he could do it to.
22037,0,Paul is effected by the discovery because he has the same problem that the janitor has. Paul understands how the janitor feels and wants to know more about the janitor's life in college and why he is not still running today.
22039,0,The background information he gets bothers him because he doesnt know if he can add up to all of it ti impress him.
22044,0,Paul probably felt special when he found out that Mr. Leonard has broken national records in hurdling and wanted to train him.  He must have felt like Mr. Leonard cared about him.

Paul confronts Mr. Leonard and finds out that he had flunked out of college because he never learned how to read. We find out in the beginning of the story that Paul goes to the learning center twice a day to learn how to read. Paul finds out through this experience that grades are important when it comes to college. You may be good at sports, but if you don't know how to read, you won't be able to play sports because you may flunk out of college. Paul realizes that he is lucky to have found a companion like Mr. Leonard to teach him a very valuable lesson about life."
22073,0,It show very little about the brackground for paule !
22076,0,"We learn through this passage that Paul can't read and that he recieves help for it. When Mr. Leonard was a student, he didn't try to get help for not being able to read, and in the end, he flunked out of a college and is now a hall monitor.

22195,0,Mr. Leonard he was good man and I think  he was like to be the.
22197,0,Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read neither did Paul.

22198,0,The effect the backgropund information has on Paul is that he has trouble reading and so does Mr. Leonard.

But then wanted to help Paul because it reminded him of where he used to be, and he didnt want to see Paul go through that."
22210,0,Paul is just a boy and he dose nothing after school. When Mr. Leonard tells him to 'meet me in the gym 2:30' Paul is use to listing to Mr. Leonard and does what he is told.

Then Mr. Leanard 'got this scap of paper and handed it to Paul'. When he looked up this name he relized that he was go at track and he knew what he was taking about. Not like the other people that he would listen to.
22218,0,That Paul is good at sports
22221,0,It has an effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard has kept his past from Paul the whole time he was training him. Paul was probably upset at Mr. Leonard for not telling Paul he was a hurdler in college but his work was to hard for him to be able to stay in college so he flunked out.
22228,0,Paul and Mr. leonard has and had the same problem. paul was always ashaed ABOUT HIS READING DIORDER. HE WASNT VERY GOOD AT ANYTHING OR TRIED OUT FOR ANYTHING. MR. LEONARD HELP PAUL COME OUT HIS SHELL WHEN PAUL FOUND OUT THAT MR. LEONARD HAD A READING PROBLEM.

22255,0,"The background information tells him that Mr. Leonard was a really good sports player, and that he had made records. Mr. Leonard didn't want to tell Paul about it, because he has had the same experience that Paul had. Paul told him 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' 'What happened after that?' said Paul. Mr. Leonard said 'I was a good athelete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' Mr. Leonard doesn't want Paul thinking he can't acheive something, just because he didn't. He wants him to try real hard. Which is why he decided to help him out."
