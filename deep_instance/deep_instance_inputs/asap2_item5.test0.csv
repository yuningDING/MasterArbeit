13331,0,mrna is copied into trna
13333,0,-Anaphase...combine-Interphase...move apart-Metaphase..meet in the middle -Prophase..divide into 2
13335,0,first the proteins are gathered. next the proteins separate. then start to synthesize. if proteins dont move during process then they will be reproduced.
13337,0,m RNA leaves the nucleus
13340,0,"In protein synthesis after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the cell will need to make a copy of the mRNA. After copying it, it will be synthized. Then, the copied version and the original version will be crossed over to cause genetic variation for the organism. Last, the cell will be sent out to the body to replace the ones that can no longer do thier job efficiently."
13341,0,"Four major steps would be prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase."
13342,0,The nucleus leaves the body.
13344,0,annaphase prophase metaphase telephase
13345,0,The first step is the mRNA is unzipped by a RNA polymerase. Then it is made into tRNA. After that it enters our DNA and lastly it is made into protein.
13346,0,htey are manufacture and produced and used trhen excreated from the nucleus
13347,0,Well after the RNA leaves the nucleus it makes a sectiond strand that maches form the strand that it made to go with the DNA. It then turns in to TRNA witch turn the T bace in to a U bace and the U bace pears up with the A bace. Then they canect with the RRAN to make the ameno acideds.
13348,0,mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein.
13349,0,mrna leaves the nucleus
13350,0,"mRNA leaves the nucleus first, second they get the ATP and they take it to the mitochondria and they let them know what they have to fix, fourth they go to the place where the cell needs fixed, and fifth they end up with protein synthesis."
13352,0,mRNA enters the cytoplasm. It then carries instructions to the ammino acid sequence. Then it turns into tRNA and carries the complete sequence off. From there it creates a protien.
13353,0,protein's gather together.proteins attach to each other.in order to attempt to repair the nucleus.proteins go to the nucleus.
13354,0,#NAME?
13355,0,"The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are when the DNA is being replicated, when rRNA is being produced, when tRNA is being produced and when mRNA is being changed."
13356,0,first you go to prophase then from prophase you go to metaphase from metaphase you go to anaphase from anaphase you go to telephase during all these steps you start offf with two cell then you have the cells seprating into two seprate one then they just end as being one cell
13357,0,It gets rid of the nuleus.
13358,0,"prophase, metaphase,interphase, anaphase"
13359,0,nuclitide. mitocondri. fagella. goli apperatuce.
