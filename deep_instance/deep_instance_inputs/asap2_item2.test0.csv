4081,0,"In conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B because it hangs longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. maybe put something else than weight, I think scissors."
4084,0,"3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers."
4088,0,"There is only two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is by telling the day or hour of the experiment, and see if the student's hypothesis was correct or not."
4089,0,"The students that could of have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results its make sure all their supplies are there put the data table in order, and follow the time as instructed."
4106,0,"a) A conclusion i can make base on this data is that all the specific plastic types had very different effects by either growing, shrinking, or staying the same.^p (b)Two ways the student could have proved the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used."
4108,0,"The different plastic type stretched different A. plastic A in the T1 they stretched less the the T2 in the plastic B in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial C the trial, they stretched more than the trial 2. D they are equal.^p B. The two ways the student could have improved to the experimental design or validity of the results is add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the other is and then measure the length of the plastic types."
4110,0,"Based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched, one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. One way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were. And second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after."
4128,0,a) T2 the amount that was stretched in was more than the amount in T1. ^p b) The student could have estimated 2.
4129,0,A= As the students where doing the right thing but they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more. ^p B=The could have improved it by writing how many times they did it and record how long they did it for.
4135,0,The plastics stretched a small amount in most in some stayed the same.^p He could of added more weights.^p Waited more times.
4137,0,So  in this lab I recorded four types  of plastic type bags. Also I recorded the amount stretched in the four types of bags. I did two tries each. Two things they could improve is their procedure list their data table. Also their results of the amount stretched.
4147,0,"Based on the students data, my conclusion would be that T2 got more results than T1. Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design by giving more results, and measurements."
4167,0,"(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretched the most, so it would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Telling what kind of plastics they used were: ^p     2 Be more detailed by how long they stretched it for."
4170,0,The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table.
4172,0,What kind of plastic was it.
4175,0,A conclusion I can draw based on the students data is that plastic type A stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type D didn't stretch at all but stretched the longest out of thin four types. One way that this design could have been improved is if the plastic types could have been named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make the experiment work better.
4186,0,The student should have made the procedure less.
4189,0,a) Basically these students are trying to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other how much weight it can take. ^p b) The first way the students could have improved is that the could have measure the plastic and the second way they could have improve is to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break.
4191,0,"In conclusion, the plastic type have more amout stretched that the other one in both trial. For example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23."
4194,0,"As shown in the data, most of the test subjects stretch by one, with so, this project was a success. ^p 1. He could have use more time on the weights. ^p 2. He could have use different weights."
4199,0,Based on the data table I can conclude that plastic type A was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most. Also that plastic type D was strongest due to the fact that it didn't stretch at all. A validity issue is that plastic type C had shrunk in size when the test was to see it stretch.
4203,0,"My conclusion is that the numbers will go higher lowes and a way they can improve the trials is by putting more work in it, so it can be a good grade or data count."
4208,0,a) In conclusion in the procedure it can be seen that plastic type A had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are in either add more weight to the plastics or to let the weight being off the plastics for more than five minutes.
4212,0,"Based on the students data all of the types of plastics managed to stay around the same amount of being stretched. ^p I, the students could have shown constants, 2.)The students could have explained how the experiment was done a little bit more."
4227,0,b)The first would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to understand the difference of both experiment/ second would be to conduct a longer time setting to see how long it last.
4229,0,"In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer. These students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic, stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well."
4236,0,My conclusion about this experiment is that T1 doesn't strech more than T2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic D or change.
4242,0,Based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type A has the most strechibility while plastic type C was the least amount stretched in the two trials while plastic type A's amount streched increased 2mm. Plastic type B's amount streched decreased 1mm two ways the student could have improved the experiment of design and/or validity of the results would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways.
4247,0,"In conclusion, in trial2 the plastic stretched more than in trial .^p B) The students could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic and by allowing to let them hang longer."
4259,0,"In trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn't a tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample A had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, while sample D had the most amount of millimeters and didn't change at all. ^p 1 Use different sample of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure they are all coming from same temperature."
4261,0,Draw a investigation is meatanese.
4266,0,"Based on the information from the table, plastic type A has more stretchability than the rest. ^p The student could've tested longer because like I said before, time is a factor in determining things when testing. Also, the student should've added weights to the second trial."
4270,0,The plastics did not stretch as much in trial 2 (T2) as they did in trial 1 (T1).^p The student could've explained what we were looking for maybe with a hypothesis. They also could've identified the plastic types.
4274,0,Plastic type A is definately the streatchiest where as plastic type D is the least stretchy. The student could have improved his experiment in many ways. 2 of these ways include: letting the plastic stretch more. The students should have waited longer than 5 minutes. The other way he/she could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. The student only tested 4 types of plastics when there are many more.
4275,0,The plastic stretch out about the same they don't  have that much difference. The students could have kept adding weight to see how far the plastic would stretch. They should have gone deeper and actually figured out the exact difference.
4278,0,"A) A conclusion that could wiads from the students data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same number if it could be one higher or one lower. Also, the plastic type D is the most stretchable to both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by not only trying one experiment, testing it in four 1-10 trials. Also the student could have been more specific with the plastic types."
4283,0,a) Conclusion - plastic Type A stretched the least and plastic Type D the most. ^p 1. name type of plastic being used 2. what kind of weights are being used.
4288,0,They could of allowed the clamp to hang for 10 minutes. They could of put more weight on the clamp.
4301,0,The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity as the results and mave to decrease the differ as amount stretched an up from T1 to T2.
4302,0,"A) I can conclude that plastic A stretched the longest (2mm) and that plastic C did not stretch, but decreased in length from 14mm to 13mm (1mm). ^p B) Students could measure all the plastics aat the once and they could do something else."
4311,0,Add the fist two togahtr and that how I do it?
4314,0,"To end our experiment we calculated our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 was 20 and T2 20. The students could of used less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes."
4318,0,They could of added more weight and they could of let it hang for more than 5 min. The con clusion I have based on the student's data is that (T2) was more stretch out than (T1).
4319,0,A conclusion for the graph could be what they did to get to the end of their experiment.^p B. One way the student could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing. Another way is to make sure everything is all right.
4339,0,-I think that the plastic types is going to be more danger because the student have add clamp to the bottom of the plastic types. not only that but what the student could have done is to make the plastic type hung for more than 5 minutes and they could ha
4350,0,"In conclusion based on the student's data, plastic type D had the same amount stretched 20mm. However, Plastic type A had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by writing the types of plastic instead of type A,B,C and D. Another way the students could have improved is by adding a prediction to what they thought was going to happen."
4361,0,"It seemed as if the plastic stretched further or stayed the same in these trials. Type A stretched from 10mm to 12mm. Type B 22mm to 23mm. Type C 14mm to 13mm, and type D 20mm to 20mm. ^p B) The student should have been more specific with their table. the student also could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment."
4369,0,The student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights.
4376,0,a. The student bottles have stretched more during was first atempt and plastic B was stretched the most during both.^p b. The student could have improved his experiment by using 2 bottles to tape and not dorpping the other two bottles.
4377,0,two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could of did a little more and took there time to make things good and do there best.
4384,0,A) The stretchability for the four different types of polymer plastics. The calculations for trial one and trial two we almost the same. For example plastic type A on trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it was 12 then on plastic type D for both trials it was 20. ^p The two ways they could have improved it was by putting weights in and making it heavier and the other one is you can also bring the plastic bags apart trying to rip them.
4397,0,(A) The student found the two stretched plastics to be B and D. They both have over 20 mm in both trials and performed much better than the two other trials. ^p (B) The student could have improved his procedure of experiment by giving a hypothesis of just which plastic they thought would be the stretchiest. After that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn't.
4401,0,Based on the students data there really wasnt any difference in the animals stretched. The students could have put more weights on they even could have extends the time hanging to improve the experiment design and / or validing of the results.
4403,0,"A. Plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C stretch 1mm and plastic D didn't stretch. ^p B. The student could have done this over distinct results . The student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower."
4418,0,"A) My conclusion for this experiment is that Trial 2 is going to get the most stretchability  for the plastic type. ^p B) The plastic sample doesn't have to hang freely down the side of a table and before  you perform the second trial just like the first, add on additional 5-10 minutes to the procedure."
4425,0,a) Based on the students data the plastic don't stretches a lot much type 1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference.^p b)
4432,0,"A) Based on the students data, my conclusion to this is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, because for both trials, the mm of the length was still the same. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch."
4450,0,To my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than the first time because it was already stretened from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened. two ways to improve the experiment is time it longer to see the difference and use a different piece of plaste for each trial.
4453,0,They could have used beacher holder and tape the plastic to the beaker holder and let it hold freely.They could get more results for different trials.
4458,0,"Plastic A and B stretched, cup C Di stretched whe mm and plastic D stayed the same. This experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer."
4470,0,One way they could of improved this experiment.
4473,0,The conclusion of this evestigation is that the plastic types did not stretch much. Type D didn't even phase B. The kould have told us what kind of plastic did they use. And what are you using to measure the plastic types?
4475,0,"The polymer plastics all had different results after each trial was tested. Plastic type A and B both had an increase in length after trial 2. Plastic type C had a negative effect by going down a mm, and D stayed the same. The student could have used different time periods, or even tested the durability of the plastic after it was tested."
4479,0,None of the plastic really seemed to move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much.
4484,0,"In conclusion all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type D that stoped the same length. They would of told the types of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also, give before descriptions on procedures."
4485,0,"Plastic type 'A' and 'B' stretched more in the second trial as compared to 'C' which decreased by 1mm and 'D' which stayed the same. ^p (B) Maybe to show some difference the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times."
4486,0,I think the student the student should draw a conclusion based on the data he/she has.
4487,0,Plastic type D stretched the furthest and plastic type A stretched the lowest. The student could've listed the diffrent types  of plastics used and explain the procedure better.
