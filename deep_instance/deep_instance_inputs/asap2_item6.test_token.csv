500028222,0,For them cell to swim through. Flagella000has a tail that helps move them throughout the membrane. Bring in important materials that the cell needs. The holes also help remove waste from the cell. 
500028223,0,"From the membrane by traveling through the cell. Passive transport is that when there is too much of a substance within the cell, and part of the membrane disolves, letting the substance in. "
500028224,0,"Endocytosis moves things into the cell that are smaller, and cells protect the membrane. "
500028225,0, in the process of transfering dna to other parts of the body. 
500028226,0,Moving substances across a cell is osmosis. Osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane by telling the substance where to go. 
500028227,0,"Aids in how the cell moves. Also, carrier proteins, tube shaped, move things in and out of the cell. Finally the substance is transported through the cell through the cell membrane. "
500028228,0,Way cells control the movement of substances from an area of higher consentration to an area of lower concentrationosmosis000 the diffusion of water across a cell000 may have to deal with a hypertonic or hypotonic solution. 
500028229,0,A it threw littel tiny cells to the membrane
500028230,0,"Be electron transport chain (etc). The electron transport chain or etc carries neutrons across the cell membrane would be trascription, which takes protein and turns it into mrna. Translation takes mrna and decodes it for the cell to read and use. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permiable membrane through the pores in the cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out of the cell. Sometimes there are spaces in the membrane allowing tiny things to get through it. "

500028241,0,Way is that they cross thhe cerrebellum to get across. Mitosis divides the daughter cells inside the membrane. 
500028242,0,Help of the mitochondrion. Protien synthesis goes through the membrane after the ribosomes produce them. 
500028243,0,Reticulum helps proteins travel through the cell membrane. 
500028244,0,Go to each part of the cell. Some also use facilitated diffusion. Diffusion and osmosis are types of passive transport. Osmosis is the process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane. 
500028245,0,By having a certain hole in their area this lets larger objects get through the membrane easily and effectively. 
500028246,0,"Nessicary a cell can use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. Cells also use osmosis, which means that particles are spread apart equally inside and outside of the cell000equilibrium. "

500028262,0,The cell is save. Even though these methods are used some things are very small and can fit through the cell membrane and requires energy3. Passive diffusion000diffuses small particles through the cell membrane. Diffusion helps control what substances cross the cell membrane is
500028263,0,The substances in the cell. 
500028264,0,To help large particles pass through the membrane. Osmosis 000 the diffusion of water accross a semi000permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is another way. Active transport is used to move water across the cell. 
500028265,0,Er which keeps the cell moving across the membrane. The cell membrane makes sure that the stuff the cell needs it makes sure it gets it
500028266,0,"Channels that direct the movement of substances across the cell membrane by transformation. Cells use a selective permeable membrane to allow certain materials through. Finally, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is a process that requires energy because it goes along with the gradient. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration to an area of lesser concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Transcription can be used, as well, but active transport isn't used all the time. Active transport000the forced movement of a nutrient or mineral through the cell by pores on the cell membrane, and diffusion"
500028267,0,Energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.

500028270,0,Water goes in and out of cells. The materials then pass through the membrane as directed by the nucleus of that cell. 
500028271,0,Moving from a place of high concentration to a low one. This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal. 
500028272,0,Types of movement a cell may use to get substances across the cell membrane are the following:1. Osmosis2. Meiosis3. Mitosis
500028273,0,Them where to go. The cell will have to take in a eukaryote
500028274,0,"To get though the cell membrane to control what comes in and out of the cellcytokinesis, movement of moisture into and out of the cellosmosis000 the movement of water from high to low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration and for the other two you go from high concentrationt to low concentration. "

500028282,0,Up and the item will get through. Some of the items that want to get through will be able to just slide through the phophilipids. Others can go through by the other proteins that will open up to let others in. 
500028283,0,Across the cell mambrane are:1) active transport2)3)difussion
500028284,0,Controls what moves through the membrane. The last way that a cell allows things into it is active transport. Endocytosis is where the large compounds come into the cell throught the membrane. 
500028285,0,The cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out of the cell. 
500028286,0,"These are next to each other creating a solid block for the cell. The cell membrane has tiny pores in them, so the cell membran knows how to prevent future problems so the cell will stay in one place, for example: some types of alge. Another type is connecting to eachother in the case of some green alge. It flotes at the water surface slowly moving with the tide. The more that is connected, the more food they get because they can take in more. "
500028287,0,"By the cell to control the movement of substances across treh cell membrane. Another process is hypertonic, which is selectively permeable in the case of a cell. Another process would be active transport. Active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient. Diffusion moves water into and out of the cellosmosis000 the movement of water across selectively permeable cell membrane*diffusion 000 molecules freely move across cell membrane until both sides have equilibruim*000 transfer proteins move molecules out of the cell. "
500028288,0,Taking in and removing wastes or materials from the cell. Lysosomes can transport bad substances from the membrane and flush them out of the cell. Every part in the cell has a cell wall the controls what comes in and out.

"
500028301,0,Exocytosis is the movement of water across the cell by using proteins that only allow substances in if they match up to the receptors perfectly. Cells also use a process in which they form a 'bubble' around a substance (endocytosis) that they want to bring into the cell (this uses atp). Another process is cellular respiration which is when the substances diffuse across the membrane. Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy. 
500028302,0,"Another example is the cell wall in plant cells that block unwanted things from entering the cell, nucleus controls the instructions for each part of the cell. Diffusion is making equilibrium by moving across the membrane. Facilitated diffusion000 the movement of a particle across a cell membrane is another.
