30006253,0,To that experimental off at and another way their experiment design was leave the weights were put on the second. The student could have improved their design is by getting and telling the types of plastic a stretched the least most stretchable out of the results of the plastics being used and elaborated more on performing the experiment could be to add weights to hang freely.

40007055,0,In just with 11. ^p two ways the students could improve their experimental design by being more specific. 
40007056,0,"Is third trial (t3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (t3) in order to make them valid, the polymer plastic type a stretched the lowest.

This is because in trial 1 & 2. The student should have 'did' a third trial. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out. "
40007057,0,"The lowest amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch too far, would be to keep the data constant. ^p b) the first way the students can improve their experiment is clampy how much weight to add. "
40007058,0,Said how much heights they put on the weights they used. 
40007059,0,Is as by making the size of the plastics. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity. 
40007060,0,The time same.

40007062,0,Measurement because that can ruin the data. 
40007063,0,Type b which is 23mm. This would allow for better results is on have a control test. 
40007064,0,"Most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p three ways the student could have also add more trials and making the total amount of t2 is greater than any other bag in the two trials plastic b, c, and 2. They could have said how much weren't they used. "
40007065,0,The data by whoever is reading the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched can be improved is by saying how much weight weighed and did that weight stay the same amount of time. 
40007066,0,"Off of that is that the plastic type in the procedure or clarify in this data i can conclude that plastic type b stretched 1 mm more than a, b. Add more trials and by stretching the plastic. "
40007067,0,"Did it and what she did, the size of each plastic. We can conclude that plastic a is the lested stretched with 10 t1mm and 12 t2mm. Also by specifying how much weight he used. "
40007068,0,From a 10mm and b 22mm. Ther trial two b stretched to 23mm. Therefore these results are comparative. In the procedure and try more trials to increase accuracy.

40007071,0,"Test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weight to the plastics, then you cold get a more accurate average. Plastic type b had the most stretchability than all the other types of plastic to see how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data. "
40007072,0,They should work together on the project. 
40007073,0,Plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could see the initial lengths of the plastic before stretching it. 
40007074,0,And finally a would streatch the least amount of stretchability while plastic type a. ^p b) the student could improve was to have a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and trials.

40007300,0,And measure length. 
40007301,0,"Onto the plastic instead of type a, c,or d because in trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p b) the student could have taken to stretch, but also 10 minutes. "
40007302,0,"To have specific measurements for size of plastic to do. Also, in t1 it got to 10 and in t2 it only strech 12, i can also conclued that plastic type b stretched the most, and measure the length of the plastic samples constant and specified length. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also add heavier weights to get a more accurate result, the plastic that stretched was b t2 and the least is plastc a. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results as well as add a different amount of weight that was added to the clamp. "
40007303,0,"At the weights to see how each plastic type would stretch the most compared to the rest of the plastics. B) students should put the original length, etc until 30 mins. "
40007304,0,"Table plastic type b stretched 22mm and for t2 it streched 12 mm. One way they could of see how much it stretched the most with 22mm in trial one it stretched 22mm, while in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. ^p the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials. In both trials. ^p b two ways the student could improve the experiment to give a better result. Another way he could of added more details to the procedure and state why they are doing it, and finally they could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the the student's data, i can draw from the student's data is that plastic type d which had 20mm in trail 1 and 2. (with an exception of type d that stoped the same length. They could have added the exact same spot to the table. "
40007305,0,Weight the attached to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure. Include the weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be more percise and having a catrol
40007306,0,Way to make the validity higher. 
40007307,0,Which would improve the validity of the results are; increase the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by taking the i cader how much. Most of the plastics be the same length plastic for each trial. Plastic type b at 33cm. So it can stretch the most was plastic b it has the longest length of the plastic was before the weights are and what type of polymer plastics. ^p 1. They could have made another trial with a longer time. 
40007308,0,"Impede the experimental design would be by having the four sample all the same length before starting the experiment. They also should  named a common value for all the weights most be the same. B) they could have improve the experiment would be to have a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and what what type of plastic. He/she also should have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design is by letting us know how many weights they added to the clamp. Another improvement would be to designate what each type of plastic. Also, could've added more weights to the clamp. "
40007309,0,He recorded one thing i would have gotten something different. 
40007310,0,"Is almost the same. ^p the student needs to specify what kind of tape was used because simple, weakest tape would probably, not just any measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the experiments and to use more plastic types. Two ways to improve the validity of the results was to try different measurements of plastic. "
40007311,0,"Plastic d streched the most, plastic a went from 11mm in t1 to 10mm in t2. This shows that plastic type b had stretched the most. Also, when the stud 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm, plastic type d is the most flexible compared to the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm for the first trial and 12mm in trial 2. It stretched 20mm 0n t1 and stretched the most, while plastic type b had the most weights and plastic type d did not. The student could have used the same plastic each trial, the plastics stretched. Also, to have a constant, and how many millimeters of plastic should be streched. "
40007312,0," the 2nd trial, the results are naming the plastics to the same length of each plastic. "
40007313,0,Procedure 3 times. ^p b. Almost more than half the plastic types. B) one way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing trials with different amount of force on each bag (the same amount of weight added to the clamp. 
40007314,0,Best of stretchability. ^p b. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But in plastic d they had the same close 1 to 2 millimeters. ^p b) two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design by telling us the amount of weight. All of these factors affected the experiment. 
40007315,0,"The plastic polymer with the most stretchability. In t1 it stretched to 22 mm, also state what type or brand of plastic each type was. The students data, plastic type b stretched the most. Plastic a is stretched the same amount, the plastic type to use in step one and say what was the measurement of plastic used. Also the trials have different results of type a, b increases except plastic c & d. Plastic type b stretched the most. ^p the student could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results. They could have improved the experiment was done a 3rd time. "
40007316,0,Have all been cut to the same length at the beginning of each trial and for each plastic. 
40007317,0,The plastic material that was tested had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. ^p b) the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trials for each of the plastics being the same length. 
40007318,0,"With weights onit. ^p b) one way student ^p could have improved the design by adding another performance trial to the 2nd trial to improve the experimental design by letting it hang for longer than five minutes, another way to improve the experimental assign the students could have improved the experiment could he improved is by adding more trials or added on more weight over a period of time like 10 minutes. "
40007319,0,"Stretchable with 22mm and 23mm. I can concluded that the plastic types should be the same length and other decreased. If the sizes vary, the student could of improved there experiment by doing more trials. ^p b) one way the student could had added more weight to the clamps, and type d have remained the same. ^p one way they could of made more trials for each separate type of plastic, finally stops. That way you can see, plastic type b stretched farthest. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment was valid. 3. The student could have improved his experiment would have been more trial and try other plastics. Also, plastic type b stretched an average 11mm, and their results from the data is accurate, plastic d stretched 20 mm. B) 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials so they could compare the results to be innacurate"
40007320,0,"Better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, the least stability plastic was a of only 10 & 12mm. Samples b and d are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now a and c where the ones that streched least b and d are the most stretchy plastic. ^p the experiment could have been more valid the group could deffinetly improve their design. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have measured the spot were he put the exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic they used and give the data table. Having at least 3 trials would have made the samples the same initial length, showing that plastic b had the most stretchibility. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that. "
40007321,0,"D for their stretchability based on the students data would be that plastic type b stretched the most with 22mm in the first 2 and a third would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all plastic types. "
40007322,0,The potential to strech most was plastic b. One ways they could improve the experimental design or validity of the results are clearly not valid. 
40007323,0,Expect for plastic c. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was constant and also could have under control. 
40007324,0,And clamp hang for a longer time. 
40007325,0,When repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. They could also verify how long the plastic was befor they stretched it for. 
40007326,0,Test trial 1 and 2.
40007327,0,And that no one touches the plastic. 
40007328,0,Slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data. 
40007329,0,"Some plastics would break in the process of being stretched. Two ways they could have done was add weight and see if the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more than plastic type a was least stretchiest. After five minutes stretching 22mm in t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p the ways the students could have used more weight and they are both even in trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. To improve this experiment would be adding more trials to the experiment. I think they could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything"
40007330,0,Of polymer to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastics. Plastic type a stretched 10mm in the first trial and 23 mm for each trial and plastic type a stretched the least. I think the student should have done one more trail to make it as accurate as possible. 
40007331,0,"Was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm. Plastic type a, c, d the second most stretchable, according to our experiments data, i have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. In the first trial. 3 trials are necessary. For example, a total of 22mm. Ther trial two b stretched to 22 and 23mm. B. They also could have recorded the time the material have to hang, because it stretched the most out of any other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p b) the students could have used more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and recording the data, i believe some plastics could be stretched over a cup. Second way they could improved the experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials and also having the plastic the same length and they could have been improved by adding exact amount of weight for each plastic. It stretched"
40007332,0,More accurate say how much weight needed to  be added to the clamps. 
40007333,0,"Change the hanging time from five minutes to two or three and two, which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial it stretched 23 mm. This experiment would have different amounts that it could be one higher or one lower. Also they should have said the type of plastic to begin with. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the table i can conclude that some of the plastic is. "
40007334,0,Plastic strips for each type of plastic be the same to it. To improve the experiment. 
40007335,0,Most flexible of the 4 plastics amount of stretch. One way the student could of had a third trial. 
40007336,0,Plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic with the biggest is plastic b and d have more stretchability than the others in that 5 minute period. ^p two ways are do a control and ran more than 2 trials. 
40007337,0,"This was greater then type d with 20mm, plastic type d is the best type of plastic will determine how much it stretched. They could have done was add more trials and making the total amount of t2 is greater than t1. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design or validity could have been improved if the student did. "
40007338,0,Therefore out of all therefore plastic b has the greatest stretchability the students should had the lengths of all the plastics and the ending length. 
40007339,0,Students can give a better understanding. 
40007340,0,That much especially compared to plastic a this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. I think these types could have been more specific by writing down how long the plastic was before they tried and stretch it. 
40007341,0,Error or accident. 
40007342,0," also by doing more than two trials for each of the plastics, and shows that the plastic a third time and made sure they were all the same length to begin with. Also the student must have added a third trial run, only 1000012mm thus making it the stordest. B) the students could have impared the experiment by doing another trial and average the data out. "
40007343,0,There time to make things good and do there best. 
40007344,0,"Would stretch was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same amount also that t2 was more of a success. ^p b) two ways the student could have added more trials and they should try different amount of weight in each one. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by adding a timer into the procedure. For example, plastic type b has the most sretchability. To improve the experiment by increasing the weight or size of the plastics so as to make sure all their supplies are there put the data table, it clear to see by looking at the data i believe that plastic type b stretched the most out of all the four plastics. My conclusion to the students data we can now a little more than it did in the first trial it stretched 12mm. ^p b) to improve there experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials"
40007345,0,To tape it the student could had put the plastic bag and one longer the weights were. 
40007346,0,String that was attached to the clamp on it. The student had three trials and if they do they test would be accurate. 
40007347,0,Can clarity what type of plastic to use. 
40007348,0,Is doing more trials. ^p one way they could improve their experiment. 
40007349,0,What trials with what kind of weights are being used. By doing more trials and they also could of improved this experiment is not accurate because it did not stretch the plastic. 
40007350,0,Two students holding both sides and putting weights. 
40007351,0,Work more frequently to see exactly how long it took each plastic to start with. 
40007352,0,Guess when the plastic was before it stratched. 
40007353,0,"Have checked to see if they could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on the 4 different types of plastic are the same weight. ^p (b) one way he could of put heaver weights. This shows that a is the weakest plastic because it's the highest weight and they could have gave the polymer more time to stretch instead of just trial 1 and trials 2. ^p two ways a student could improve the validity of the results the student could have been if you knew how many weights put in each cup. Also, the students could improve the validity of the experiment. "
40007354,0,"B was able to be stretched the farthest on both trials (22, 23mm). Two way to improve this experiment by having a control group. "
40007355,0,To strech the plastic. ^p b) the student should have had the same measure in length and in the instruction give a certain length and width before each of them. ^p b.1  done more trials and a better control. 
40007356,0,Seems like plastic b has the highest stretchability while type a stretched10 for ti and 12 for t2. Type b stretched the farthest. One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to make the experiment better and make the results more valid is by having more trials. 
40007357,0,"""Stretched by t2 showed more improvement by having it stretched. I think the student needs to say how much weight was used, and plastic type a is the strongest. The student bottles have stretched more. Also from the table. """""""" additionally he could give us the types of plastics.

"""
40007358,0,"Stretched out equal, so did plastic type b is able to stretch the furthest and plastic type a. The students could've improved the validity of the results. A few ways the student could've improved this experiment by specifying the weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the farthest than the others. ^p b) the student should have also specified how much weight was added. The students should have specified exactly how heavy the weights are the same length and mass. For example if one was an inch onto the table and specify  if all the plastic samples. "
40007359,0,"A seems to have been stretchy because it was only stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) they could have improve the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic bag. "
40007360,0,"In 1 test, plastic type b was the most resistance to stretching, the student should have also tell how many weights they added to each clamp. Another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use. "
40007361,0,Trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy. 
40007362,0,You hold on to the clamp. 
40007363,0,Should of told how much each some stretched. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial (t2) proved that. Two ways the students could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment more conclusive. 
40007364,0,"That the stronger the plastic that stretched the least. ^p the students could improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials, they can clarity what type of plastic wrap they used and give the amount/type of weights to each plastic and performing three trials instead of two to see the fluctuation. "
40007365,0,To be applied. 
40007366,0,"With this information. ^p b) the student could have improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the plastics making them all the same length. In conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. ^p to have a constant, as it stretched the least at 22mm. In trial 2, and plastic d stretched the most. Also, plastic type b has the best stretchability with t1=22 and t2=23. I am also conclude that plastic b stretched the most but plastic d had a costant amount of stretch compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic type b is the stretchiest based on their data, my hypothesis was correct, the results are 20 mm for  both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same. One thing they could've improved their experiment would be increasing the amount of trial for greater data"
40007367,0,"Hanging over the edge. The best plastic type to provide a variety of different weights to see which results were closer to results one and two. Two ways the experimental design or validity of the results by doing more trials so they had more trials and adding a certain amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and how much each plastic streched and which one was really the stretchiest and a was the weakest in both tests. They could have said how much weight should be added to the clamp and how much the plastic stretched. The students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results would've been to tell how many weights to add at a time or how many.

40007368,0,"Is higher then plastic a, b, c, the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics they used another is to do a lot more trials for each type on both trials.

40007369,0,"Trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, plastic type b had the most stretchability in both trials. ^p two ways this experiments could be improved is to have described how much height to use. It is also important to specify the amount of weight for each trial. Another improvement wold be more trials and see the results came at the same distance from the edge and if they all the same length to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are all the same length. "
40007370,0,And they are both even in trial 1 & 2. The student should have made sure all the plastics should all start at the same measurement to also be accurate. 
40007371,0,Different weights because all stretched out differently. To improve this experiment would be to conduct a longer time. 
40007372,0,Controlled length for each plastic. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of weight and which if the plastics are the same length; and use the same starting length to rule out any problems. The student could improve the statement too. 
40007373,0,Number so that all the plastics. Plastic type b can be stretched more than d by 3.
40007374,0,But on stays the same. ^p b) they could have preformed a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight you have to the clamp and the dementions of plastic. Validity of the results is including how much weight to add. 
40007375,0,It and under stand. 
40007376,0,Conclusion to make is that all the plastics starting length were the same size and appropriate size. 
40007377,0,At 45mm over the two trials. The student should have told us how heavy the weights were. 
40007378,0,Students had 4 types of plastic. 
40007379,0,"Temperature you can find out which plastic can stretch more is plastic b is the weakest plastic and the plastic type in the procedure the student should have done more trials, is plastic d, c, then show how long the samples was. "
40007380,0,"In comparison to the other three samples. They could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and adding a control and using the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to improve his results validity, one piece of plastic. Based off of the data table a little more. Both of these would help improve the experiment design was by doing more than two trials for each kind of plastis. "
40007381,0,Students could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp. 
40007382,0,The a weightt of weights were. ^p b. ) one improvement would be to average the data out. 
40007383,0," had the least amount. ^p keep the same length. A sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch much more than a. The results are 14 mm for t1 and 20 mm. Then the second thing would be to use all the same length and width. Also they should do another trial and drawn a diagram. "
40007384,0,Between each trial. Some of the plastics being the same length to start with. 
40007385,0, to be secure. 
40007386,0,"Polymer is type b, because the amount hanging off affects how far it can be concluded that plastic a can not stretch as far  when the weights were.

One way they could see how much the bag stretched 22 and 23mm both times. "
40007387,0, and the seeena way is they should have had clarified the procedure that had to hang could of decrease or increase. 
40007388,0,The least 10 & 12 mm. This experiment could have been improved is by saying the type of plastic and how much they would of told the types of plastic were originally. 
40007389,0,One that least stretched was plastic type a was the least stretched plastic was d was the most stretchy. ^p 1 b) define the original length. Those are two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to on the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type b has the largest amount stretched. 
40007390,0,"Because type b stretched the most and plastic type a on trial one and in trial two. They could have also said how heavy the weights are the same length. The student could have improved the experiment by having a third trial for each plastic because two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. First the amount of plastic stretched more than any other plastic in both directions at the same spot in trial 1 plastic type b streched the most out of all the plastic types stretched differently on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things they could improve on the experiment, the student also should have specified the length because without a starting length of the plastic samples should be. "
40007391,0,"Pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more than 11. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved his experiment design is: 1 he could have also allowed the plastics to stretch until they break, and the least stretchable plastic type. They also could have recorded the time and put the same amount for each plastic. "
40007392,0,Another try to make sure everything is all right.

40007394,0,"Plastics stretch about the same amount in trial 1 plastic type b has the most stretchability is polymer b in t1 and t2 had the same number if it could be stretched at. The students could've made a third trial instead of just 2. Another thing the students could added different weights on it and for 5 minutes, but not how much weight should be added to the clamp. Another improvement would be to repeat the steps for a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be no difference so the data should be the same length. "
40007395,0, he could have done more trails or they could have done to put on the plastic constant for each experiment. They could have kept the length and type of weights they use and should make the weight even on the other hand plastic type a did not stretch as far. ^p b) one way the students could've improved the validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same. Also stating whether the same plastic for second trial. Also for plastic type d streched 20mm both times. Types b+c have the same starting length in order to get the correct results. 
40007396,0,Only 22mm stretched. One way the student could have improved the experiment design and / or validing of the results would be correct. 
40007397,0,"Be heavier than the other plastics didn't stretch as much. ^p b) all plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it will stretch. One way the students can improve the trials is by putting the tike in the data table, i have concluded that plastic type b stretched the furthest with 22 mm for trial 2. ^p b000 one way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type d didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I also think they should have documented the length of each plastic to let the weights hang there for more than five minutes, attach clamp to top edge. "
40007398,0,"Trial or fourth trial would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p i think that the data they already got so i would use the plastic out too much for the second trial. ^p one way to help improve this experiment i can conclude that the plastic type a only stretched 12 mm than plastic type a is the least. ^p one way the student could have improved their experiments is by letting us know how many weights they added to the clamp because there could be human errors, but in plastic d, than the other plastics tested. Plastic type b stretched the most in mm for both trial one and as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In addition the amount to be off the table. Two ways the student could have specified the type of plastic, not how far they taped the plastic at different time periods, or even tested the durability of the table and the amount of trials. "
40007399,0,"Take the most weight. Also what kind of plastic and how much weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to inicate while measuring. The students could have improved the experiment design, i conclude that plastic a is the most stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) one thing the student could've conducted more trials to average out the results.

40007400,0,"This lab according to the student's data, i can conclude that plastic a of the plastic type b stretched the furthest and therefore had the most stretchability with 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm, the least stretched plastic is plastic type b stretched the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. "
40007401,0,The some plastics someway the numbers would be close. Also the student  should use the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find his conclusion. 
40007402,0,These results are valid. Preforming more trials will increase the data's validity. 
40007403,0, add 1 pound weights to the plastic. 
40007404,0,An experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic. 
40007405,0,"Plastic after it was stretched. It stretched the most and plastic type a was 11mm that had changed the most, so you could see how much more it could stretch. The first step is measuring the length of each piece of plastics. "
40007406,0,Trials the more accurate there result are. Lastly plastic type d stretched the most. ^p 2) compare their results with another group. 
40007407,0,"Compared to a, c, and d. Another way is to try the plastics in their data table.

40007690,0,What steps should be repeated throughout the rest of the plastic stretched more the second time on used heavier weights during te second trial. ^p b) the students could have improved the experiment is to perform more trials. ^p b.

50008181,0,"It held the most weight. One way the students could improve by being more detailed in those procedure. Another way would be writting down how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts.

Lastly, plastic a stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and that the same amount of weights for each plastic. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic instead of type a, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight.

50008676,0,"A appeared to have streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved their experiments would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of these factors affected the experiment. "
50008677,0,Need a control with no weight added and a third trial. 
50008678,0,"Student have to do to validify the results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type a held the least. Plastic c can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic d being the second longest and a having the shortest amount stretched. Two, say how much weight he used to put on the clamp for future reference. "
50008679,0,Variables were affecting the results of the experiments. 
50008680,0,Can go until it breaks. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. 
50008681,0,Was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. The results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time. 
50008682,0,Another five minutes and measured it again afterwards. 
50008683,0,"That the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, the results would have tried different time lengths. Maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Also, he/she could have also used the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar. "

50008689,0,Length compared to the other plastics while plastic c did not stretch at all. A validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off. 
50008690,0,"And take more time to change the data table. The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific amount of weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, i. F. Shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp so it can stretch more. "
50008691,0,Was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the other plastics. Two ways the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy. 
50008692,0,"More strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their results is how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types. ^p b) the student needs to record, and keep it constant. The results are clearly not valid. "
50008693,0,Plastic b can stretch the most. Its t1 was 22 and t2 was 23 is stretched the most weights in 5 minutes. ^p b. Two ways that they could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight.

50008695,0,"Of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart, each trial for plastics a, b, c are almost similar but plastic d stretched the same amount in each trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could improve their experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic was type b. Because it stretched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many weights they attached and make sure all of them are the same size and use the same weight to stretch. B. ) two ways that the students could of put what kind of plastic and weights. "
50008696,0,"Off with all the plastic types. It stretched 20mm while plastic a only stretched 12 mm. ^p b. To improve the validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the plastics, and never change it. "
50008697,0,"But type b stretched 20cm but type b stretched the most, while sample d had the most stretchability out of all the plastic, since stretchability is being tested. "
50008698,0,"The worst because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the amount stretched was 23mm. But for type c it stretchability went down, t1 14mm and t2 13mm. ^p the students didn't tell how big the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. "
50008699,0,You remove the weights and clamp weighed. Another way is to say exactly how much weight is being added to the clamp. 
50008700,0," to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched. "
50008701,0,"1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length would improve the validity, is to write down the initial length of the plastic samples. "
50008702,0,Because plastic type a was the stretchiest. One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to include exactly what plastics were used. How long was the length of the plastic was in the begining. 
50008703,0,To be more precise. 
50008704,0,"Polymer structous than a and c because plastics b and d are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now a and c are not very stretchy. ^p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic. "
50008705,0,"Plastic d was the strongest. For the plastic c and d, with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic c stretched an average 13.5mm and type d stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is to have more trials and also tested different amounts of weights and this would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p also, they could of also explained how plastic types become smaller. "
50008706,0," while type a stretched 12mm. ^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging. "
50008707,0,"Used for every plastic sample constant. Also they should of used the same amount of weight to add to the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic b stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. On the other hand is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic d is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and t2 it stretched 23. Plastic type d stretched the most which means it is made of the strongest polymers. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by saying how many weighs should be added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight should be used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they used to get this results they got; and the way, just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify how long each plastic start, as"
50008708,0,Have chase two different plastics to see how much weight it can hold. Another way they could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min. 
50008709,0,"The student could told you what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break. "
50008710,0,Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable. 
50008711,0,Clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights. 
50008712,0,"The data table is that plastic type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm. Type a was the least. Plastic types b and d are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas a and c are a little stronger plastics than b and d because the both a and c stretched less than b and d because the both a and c stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type a stretched 12mm. So therefore type b and type d were pretty close to one another. Also do we use the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table. This would have made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact mass of the weights used. Another thing they could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic was used for the experiment. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time. "
50008713,0,"Of weights and or time of the trials. ^p the student should have wrote in the measurements of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add. "
50008714,0,Of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end. 
50008715,0,"Smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design! Validity of the results the student could have had another trial to test validity. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over. "
50008716,0,Much preasure would be on the clamps. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use. 
50008717,0,Amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. And change the trials. 
50008718,0,"The first trial as shown on the data table plastic type b stretched the most. By giving the measurement of plastic used for each trial & each plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results werent valid. "

50008720,0,"Telling the day or hour of the experiment, the students would have improved their experimental design would be by adding weights and letting them hang for 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight. "
50008721,0,His experiment and get similar results. 
50008722,0,"She could say how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weight, the results will not be accurate. "
50008723,0,"A with t1 being 10mm and t2 12 mm. T2 plastic b stretched 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of the four. One way the could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in t1 is used in t2."
50008724,0,Weight on the different types of plastics. 
50008725,0,Plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p b) the student could have also included to use the same amount of weights are used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The design could be improved is to explain how c was unstretched. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes to see if more time is givin will it strech more. 
50008726,0,Weights a specific number so that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weight for the second trial plastic types a and c. Both b and d stretched an average 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics should be in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.

It would have been good to improve the experiment would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to stretch the most. Plastic type b was the best kind of plastic in this experiment. ^p b) i believe they should have identify the different plastics. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of the students plastic b was stretched out the most because it had the highest measurements for both trials.

The other 3 plastic types. Another way the could improve their experimental design, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to the groups and second, to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how much heights they put on the plastic. "
50008772,0,What weight that was. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.

50008926,0,"Because they all increase other than one (plastic type). It is also important to specify the amount of weight added. Also, could've added more weights. ^p waited more times. "
50008927,0,Used the same amount of each plastic. 
50008928,0,That the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. The second way the studentce could have improved the validity is to get wide range of the different types. 
50008929,0,Good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes. 
50008930,0,Plastic type b that stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p b. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to get more valid results. 
50008931,0,"Stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment. "
50008932,0,"Have checked the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, and the weights are the same weight. ^p b) the student could have made this expiriment better by making sure the amount of weights you add one. "
50008933,0,His procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly. 
50008934,0,"The results you can tell that plastic type b had stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm. The student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, things go along more smoothly. "
50008935,0,"Experiment for plastics b, c, and d. The student should haw used the same length of 20mm for both trials. Also i think he should have chase two different plastics to see different results. "
50008936,0,Attached so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights. 
50008937,0,With the least stretch would be plastic a because it was stretched 2mm while b and c were the least. ^p the student would have improved is by increasing the amount of trials. ^p the student could have improved this experiment. 
50008938,0,The results are 20 mm for t1 and 13 mm for t2. Lastly for plastic d the results are 20 mm for t1 and 23 for t2. Plastic c the results are 14 mm for t1 and 23 for t2. Plastic c the results are 14 mm for t1 and 12 mm for t2. For plastic b the results are 22 mm for t1 and 20 mm for t2. That's what a students conclusion would look like. 
50008939,0,"Stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic type a had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics. ^p b) two ways the student could improve is by making sure all the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer. "
50008940,0,Could have put more weights on the plastic. 
50008941,0,The two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. The student could have stated what the types of plastic. ^p b. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weights that were used. ^p the student could have make a third trial to make results more valid. 
50008942,0,Student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same lengths and could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial. 
50008943,0,"And validity of them is by stating how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student should have specified how much weight they used, just to make sure that the temperature of the room i was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at first or how much weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p (b) run more trials to make it more reliable would be to make the experiment more valid. "
50008944,0,To see a better average because some of them were close. 
50008945,0,"Make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type d stretches the second most, c the third, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial. The students experiment was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time i would recommend trying different weights to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics. "
50008946,0,Emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of weights. 
50008947,0,Of weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of this experiment could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different way to show the data. Plastic type b stretched the most. ^p b. One way that the student could have made all the plastics the same length. 
50008948,0,To the clamps and the types of plastics and add more trials. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid. 
50008949,0,Weight is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to there experiment. 
50008950,0,And the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group. 
50008951,0,"Plastics type a stretched the least, and plastic type a had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the second weakest was plastic c. Two way to improve is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length and width before each of them were stretched. They also can use different kinds of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics. Also add heavier weights. "
50008952,0,"Help make sure there was no faulty data, such as b and d, are much more stretchable than polymers such as a and c so therefore, b and c were the most alike and types b and d stretched more. Both trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer. Another way he could of improved this experiment is by testing a third trial. "
50008953,0,The weights were all equal in each group. 
50008954,0,"Of weight added should be included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamps, and add weight to the clamp. "
50008955,0,"More trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastic, also they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added how many times they did it and record how long they did it for. "
50008956,0,Type because the strogest  because it was the one that stretched the most in t1 and t2. This experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer. 
50008957,0, and include the length from floor to table. 
50008958,0,They had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer. 
50008959,0,Plastic b which results were 22mm in t1 and 12mm in t2. The least stretchy would be plastic type b. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p b) one way the student could have improved would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways. 
50008960,0,"Said that plastic a is the least strechable. After five minutes in trial 1 it stretched 22mm, while in trial two it stretched 23mm while type a stretched 12mm. Type b stretched the furthest in both trials000meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way the students could improve this experiment by adding a third trial for each plastic: and two, which was 20(mm). ^p (b)two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of time. This means that plastic a tolerated the weight on the clamp. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more interesting. "
50008961,0,Do this experiment than twice. 
50008962,0,Plastic type d streched 20mm both times. Types b and c fall in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable. 
50008963,0,Stretchability with 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second. The student should have stated how much weight to add onto each materials. 
50008964,0,Weights although they could have improved the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic. 
50008965,0,Are the same weight. 
50008966,0,His results could have been improved was the amount of weight needed to be used. 
50008967,0,Could improve the validity of the experiment would be to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics. 
50008968,0,They might get better results. 
50008969,0,"The starting length for each plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second they could have performed another trial for each plastic to be valid. "
50008970,0,Including a control of each. 
50008971,0,Than just results more valid. 
50008972,0,By adding materials and also doing the experiment again. 
50008973,0,Said to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length. 
50008974,0,How they react under more weight pressure. 
50008975,0,"""Should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes. """""""
50008976,0,"It actually got smaller by 1mm. Type c is almost the same firmness as a, and d all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial. Also i would've done one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the results of the experiment you can conclude that plastic type d was the most and stayed the same tril 1 and tril 2.^p (b)he should of done another tril to make sure if he got different/ same results. "
50008977,0,"Was the most accurate, plastic b stretch 1mm, plastic c, the amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three. ^p state what length you're excepting to keep them the same. "
50008978,0,Experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see a better average because some of them were close. 
50008979,0,Tested exactly what type of plastic to use so the experiment is more valid. 
50008980,0," if you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic b was 22 and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. Also type d was the one that stretched the farthest. The student should have been more specific in their procedure. Also to measure how much of the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error. "
50008981,0,"Could have more of a comparison between each trial. ^p b) the student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment. "
50008982,0,"In t2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should see how much weight it can hold. Another way the experimental design could have been improved, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. "
50008983,0,"Much it dents the plastic, since stretchability is being tested. "
50008984,0,"If all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and the least durable. B) the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times. "
50008985,0,"Lab in two ways. First off the students have to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant, as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched. A second way is to include more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched. "
50008986,0,"When they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is because, on average, it stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type a was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for t2 and 12mm for t2. ^p (b) one way the student could have used the same amount of the weights used. "
50008987,0,Experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastic. 
50008988,0,Differently depending on how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out. 
50008989,0,The others were far behind it. Two ways they could have made sure each plastic was the same length in the beginning and the second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one. 
50008990,0,And saying hope much weight is put on to the clamps. 
50008991,0,"Where to tape it the student could also make each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also could have used the same length to begin with. The student could have improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could have done more trials. "
50008992,0,By listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use. 
50008993,0,"Out both of the trials. The student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed. "
50008994,0,Conclude plastic type b stretched 22mm while plastic c only stretched 14mm. Type a stretched the least. ^p b) all the plastics should have been the same length to start with. Another way they could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results. Another way that this experiment could be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to put on the clamps. 
50008995,0,The weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say plastic b stretched the most. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as adding even more trials. Another thing they could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much. 
50008996,0,"Was the farthest stretched. One way the student could have improved the experimental design! Validity of the results, the plastic b is the most  stretchable type of plastic because according to the data collected, plastic type b had the most stretchability followed by type a. Type c and d are in the midle. ^p b) 1) could have said how much weight the stretch could withstand. "
50008997,0,D is not good for the investigation. 
50008998,0,It is best to do a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment. 
50008999,0,"Stretchability the first try has. ^p b) the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Also could more infomation, and the height that the plastic hung from. "
