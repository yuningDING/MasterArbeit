1676,0,Pleace a simple of one material into one container and label it. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container.
1677,0,"Determin the mass of four different samples marble, limestone, wood, plastic. They all have starting mass and end mass, and the diffrence. The wood has the most mass but marble has the most diffrence in mass."
1679,0,To replicate this experiment you would need four new samples. You would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in.
1690,0,The student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not. Also they should have added what could've went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better.
1693,0,"For me to be able to replicate this experiment, i would just have to follow the procedure over again.For example, i would have to determine the mass of all four samples. Next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act."
1694,0,"Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before. Another thing you would need is to know the collected information, on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins. What was in the when you pilled it out."
1695,0,In this experiment I would also include how it looked after 24 hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1716,0,You would need the nishpoping  and you would need to know were they got the number from.
1719,0,"At least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment. The procedure are determine the mass of four defferent samples. Pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers, place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. Determine the mass of each sample."
1733,0,You would also need beakers and test tube and a timer.
1735,0,"Besides knowing the procedure, in order to replicate this experiment I would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve. That way, I could make sure I am coming up with the right information to answer the problem. Another piece of information I would have to know is if there is a control group. This is because if there was one, I could compare my data from the different samples to the control group. Also I would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be."
1739,0,You wouldn't need any additional information. That prscjar was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure.
1742,0,In order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures. They would double the hours to see what would happen. Repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water. And don't dry the samples.
1744,0,The additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out. Also I would say has with distilled water to use to use plan's ruin anything.
1750,0,"Need to know how much weight of the sample to start with, how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes."
1753,0,"The I.V.,D.V.,control variables, and constant variables must be included in the procedure."
1762,0,Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample. Information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment.
1768,0,"The three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the diifferent samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers, and after 24 hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water."
1774,0,"I would need to know how the samples look in the procedure. I feel like this because i already knoxw starting, ending and difference in all mass. To do the difference, i would have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures."
1782,0,"Determine the mass of four different samples. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. Determine the mass of each sample. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes."
1788,0,"In order to replicate the experiment, what will be needed is the depended, independent and the control, which are vinegar, the container and the timing to each sample."
1793,0,"A group os student idid a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples. The put the four different samples which is marble, limestone, wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the mass afther every sample loss mass expect for wood. I had the same mass afther it was measured."
1797,0,"I think you will need a bottle of vinegar,a container cabels, temer, paper, a manole, a cemenstone, wood and a plastic. You will  need.."
1800,0,Step one:pour a vinegar in four identical containers. ^p Step two:Place a meterial in each container and label it. ^p Step three:After 24 hours remove the material and rinse it out with water. ^p Step four:Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes and determine the mass.
1810,0,In order to repeat his group's procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup. Place the same material into the same one it had (the mass amount). Then procead with the same thing that you did with the last one. Sit for 24 hours then rince with distiled water.
1812,0,"In order to replicate this experiment, you need to explain why the samples loss mass, what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same. Yo also need to tell us what you saw,show us what happened when the samples were lossing its mass. Maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar."
1815,0,You would need: ^p 1)Conclusion about how you did everything. ^p 2)Results of how everything came out as you wanted. ^p 3)Information about the procedures.
1816,0,"I think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass, so that your result will be more accurate. Also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing."
1820,0,They should have done more tests. They also should have wrote what the experament was about.
1826,0,"The additional information is how are we suppose  to measure the mass of the object, they need a indenpent varible and I  need to then the control."
1833,0,"In this table it's says that first when starting mass that time marble was 9.8 then it's decrease it would 9.4. So it's decrease -0.4. In limestone the mass is decreas too. First, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. In starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too. So it's in no change. In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's in difference beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change. Then limestone It's in big change to other because it's heavy them other."
1840,0,This isn't a clear statement. Use to this expirement the problem would explain why the students were conducting this expirement in the first place.
1856,0,Additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information.
1863,0,Do the experiment again but with a different solution. ^p Let the samples sit for 48 hours. ^p Instead of sit and dry. Dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth.
1871,0,You would also need to.
1873,0,"In order to replicate the experiment , in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment. You need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples."
1881,0,"The pour into the take the vinegar in each containers. ^p who is the problem ( Hypothesis) ^p How you can do this experiment ^p A table who explain the experiment ^p use more types of masses like glass, paper, etc."
1893,0,We would need to have a contini. Also an independent variable and a dependent variable.
1898,0,"In order to replicate the experiment , you will need to record the mass 8 of different samples. You also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while , then you determine the mass."
1905,0,"In order to replicate the experiment, I need wood, plastic, limestone, marble and vinegar. Also, I would need water to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hour soak."
1913,0,Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is steps 1-6 because there importan to make the table acecit. You woud also need to make other table to show you resits and other infomation.
1917,0,"You will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar. What happen to the sample after it drys,  and what the experiment looks like"
1923,0,Three pieces of information I would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers. A scale to weight the mass and find thedifference  at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with.
1930,0,"The additional information you would need to know is the shape, size, and liquid."
1935,0,"The three additional information that can be added is the control of the experiment,the students could've done these with a warm temperature and one with cold. Lastly,they could have used regular water than distilled water."
1943,0,"Acid rain. ^p Will repeat some samples, make data, and check if the experiment is correct."
1948,0,"In group's acid rain procedure, the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry."
1949,0,Instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with. Also instead of leaving it for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if there would be a certain change in mass. Also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes.
1951,0,"I would say wood because the mass difference is 0.On the starting mass is 11.2, so is the end of the mass 11.2"
1955,0,1.You would need to measure the starting mass. ^p 2.You would need to measure the ending mass. ^p 3.You would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass.
1971,0,This is not a clear statement of the experiments. Aclear statement of the problem would include an explation of why students were pavestigation and the fain.
1972,0,The mass is ending 9.4 and of the wood is 11.2 in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso.
1974,0,Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment. Adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment. Another peice of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar. This would probably have an increased affect on the materials. Another peice of information would be to do more trials. This would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials.
1976,0,I would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff.
1983,0,"""They would need to explain how their experiment went. So they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the mass of each. So this is how they should explain their experiment. """"We've tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The mass of each were marble 4.8, limestone 10.4, wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2. When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1. So the mass of the marble went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."""
1987,0,You need a grab for the chart.
1993,0,"I think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of, Also they should have once more trials each , why this observation was being done."
2007,0,You would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it'll absorb some of the vinegar.
2015,0,"In this lab the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment again you should have a control. Another think is that how many samples to put in one container. Also, you would need distilled water."
2018,0,"Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be certain amount of vinegarI would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers."
2020,0,"They need the data to add of each experiment, need hypothesys."
2025,0,This procedure is not descriptive at all. Wedon't even know what to use for the first step. It also doesn't say the exact amount of what everything should be. The last mistake it states to label but we are not sure of the exact name. So all of these mistakes would need to be fixed.
2027,0,You will need to write a hypothesis on the experiment and a conclusion on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment went through.
2032,0,I would need them to explain to me how they got the conclusion (mass of the 4 samples). ^p Then I would tell them to include procedure step by step throught the exsperiment. ^p How much acid rain was need to effect the mass.
2039,0,Some additional information that they would need to replicate the experiment is to add the starting mass with the ending mass. Then they get an answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers.
2049,0,"A proceder that I would put in that after they all dryed, then I out them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass from starting mass."
2051,0,"This is a good procedure to follow, only it lacks of some problems towards the end, which cause the experiment to completly go wrong, because of the fact that you will be unable to finish the investigation. I myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure, for example it is necessary to comprare all the answers with one another by subtracting and seeing each others differences, and 8. Depend exparament al least three times to see if it is valid."
2054,0,"Additional information you would need would be your independent variable, dependent variable, control and you would have to form a hypothesis. The independent dont variable is what you control and the dependent variable depends on the I.V."
2065,0,"To make the experiment able to be replicated, there can be a different amount of time. There can also be more containers which lastly there can be different placements, such as one container can be in the sun, another can be in the shade. Or simply there can be a temperature differences instead of measuring the mass. All these factors can make this experiment reprodurable."
2066,0,"Additional information I will need in order to replcate this experiment is how long you leave the vinegar in the four different samples, how many times you have to do it for and how you measure the mass."
2067,0,"We need more, starting mass, ending mass & difference in mass & then test it all over."
2068,0,"It is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they did and every color, temperatur after s minutes and every temp after 16 minutes."
2069,0,I think in order to replicate the experiment you would have to change the data recorded for this experiment.
2071,0,I don't know.
2080,0,"To repeat this experiment, you would need  have valid data, a control and more trials. Also I would put the four samples of vinegar in different environments such as a refrigarator or incubator. To see if the data would be affected."
2085,0,In the experiment limestone has the most different in the mass. Wood didn't change at all. The mass stayed the same. Wood had highest starting and ending mass. To make this experiment better they could of had more trial.
2093,0,"To replicate this experiment you would need to have a starting mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic to do this you would also need to use the group's procedure."
2105,0,"You would need to find out what the mass is (question 1 ), we would also need to know what the remaining samples are (question 2). Lastly, we would want to answer question 6 and find out the mass."
2110,0,The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is 1:I have to get all the ingredient for the experiment .2: Later  I have to put all the ingredients to ge ther and I have to show how  to prepare the experiments.Then iI all the ingredient and I have to know how to prepare the experiment and later I have to give the time necesary and for the end I have to check was what the result.
2112,0,"In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determine the mass of the four different samples 2 times of four vinegar in each of four seperate but identical container 2 times. Next,place a sample of one material into one container 2 times. Then repeat with the remaining samples and place a single sample into a single container. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass of each sample."
2124,0,"They didn't come up with conclusions, they problem, thesis"
2135,0,"Additional information you would need would be why they are doing this experiment (purpose statement), more trials of the experiment and a control."
2138,0,"I would need all four samples: Ad the old results, and vingar. Also water and containers."
2146,0,"You'd need a stop wacth, you'd need to be there at the exact time,leave the mass"
2149,0,In order to replicate this expierement I would need to have all the materials that are found in this procedure. I would then gather all of my materials and follow the procedure and also record my data down on a piece of paper. In expierements I always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around.
2152,0,"In order to replicate this experiment I would need the mass of the containers, a description of the container, and a control in order to maximize the accuracy of the data."
2153,0,"To replicate the experement, I would need to know the problem of the experiment. What the mass of the sample has to do with the experiment and what the marble, limestone, wood, and plastic are for."
2173,0,"First you would need to gather your materials. Then because safety is first, make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves. After you organize yourself, you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on. After the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph/chart."
2177,0,I would pour the vinegar in non-identical container so you could know which is which. You could measure how much you put in to the cup or containers. They could have done the trial more than once to make it was correct.
2178,0,Marble limestone and plastic all absent in the negetives in differences.
2188,0,"I will need a balance to weight the mass of four different samples.Replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically.After 24 hours, i will use water to rinse each sample. After i will use the balance to check if there is any change in the mass of each."
2189,0,"Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is that I would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples (triple-beam balance). I would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples. The group showed the difference on their data table, but didn't list that step in their procedure. Lastly, I would need to record every different mass on the data table which also isn't a step in the group's procedure."
2191,0,"What the procedure is asking is for them to find away how to make acid rain. Yo will need containers to hold the rain, then your will need to label the containers. After 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass."
2194,0,"I would need there 1.prediction to what they were really questioning. I would probably say the date and time also, including there conclusion."
2195,0,They did not look up data about acid bain and they need t.
2203,0,"This procedure can be improved. You must keep everything constant, including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment. Multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range. A control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate."
2204,0,"You will need marble, limestone, wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment. You will need to experiment with all of there."
2206,0,I would like to have known why were they doing this experiment? And why didn't or the samples get compare with warer by the vinegar?
2207,0,Well first a problem statement would be helpful knowing there independent and dependent variable also knowing their controle group would have helped.
2214,0,What could be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get more results. They also could find a control so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples right after they took them out of the vinegar because the water could have had as affect an their accurate.
2216,0,In order to replicate this experiment you would need is to know how many containers we would need.
2223,0,"You place the sample of one material container into one container and label repeat the sample iinto a single container. After 24 hours,remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the sample to sit and dry for 30 min."
2226,0,"If I wanted to make the same kind of experiment, I would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separate but identical containers. Then I would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with distilled water. Finally, allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 min."
