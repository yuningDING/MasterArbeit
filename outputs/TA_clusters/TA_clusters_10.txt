0	10	3	3	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .
1	10	3	3	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays off of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture , and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse painted black the dog would get to hot and die . so white
4	10	3	3	black :: The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside . The average temperature with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) . The average temperature for the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) and for the white it was 42 ( DEG ) . There is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the black and white colored lid . So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside .
5	10	3	3	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint because in the experiment , the jar with the white lid increased the least in temperature . It increased 18 ( DEG ) C while the black lid made the temperature increase 29 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat .
7	10	3	3	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it will be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black . Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53 ( DEG ) and when it was white the inside of the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C
8	10	3	3	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
9	10	3	3	light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of the light energy , but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get too hot or cold . The white color had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes , which might be too cold . The dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , which might be too hot .
10	10	3	3	black :: Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53 ( DEG ) C , which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors . So to me I think black would be the best color .
11	10	3	3	light gray :: The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm . On average , the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 42 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 21 ( DEG ) C ) . Compared to the black color ed lid , which went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 53 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 29 ( DEG ) C , which is too hot ) . Or the white colored lid which went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 4 2 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 18 ( DEG ) C ) . Therefore , a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse .
13	10	3	3	black :: the black one will have a good heat for the dog because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 ( DEG ) c .
14	10	3	3	light gray :: I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in the summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot .
15	10	3	3	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because it would keep the dog cooler . White would absorb less solar and thermal energy , therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse . In the experiment , the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42 ( DEG ) C , while the black lid jar averaged 53 ( DEG ) C . The light gray lid produced and air temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48 ( DEG ) C .
18	10	3	3	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint color for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlight and so it would be cooler . If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45 ( DEG ) c so white would be a great doghouse color .
19	10	3	3	black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black , then the temperature will be warmer , because it has the highest average temperature at 53 ( DEG ) C .If they use white , then it will bne colder , because the average when white was 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer it will be because black was 11 ( DEG ) C more than white .
20	10	3	3	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler . White does attract heat like the color black does . When started at 24 ( DEG ) C , the black lidded jar went up to an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . And the white lid ded jar , which also started at 24 ( DEG ) C , only went up to an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
21	10	3	3	white :: the best color to choose would be white because on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
22	10	3	3	white :: according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature , the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb light .
24	10	3	3	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temperature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day , than say black paint for example . When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the white lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature . On average about 6 .6 ( DEG ) C cooler , compared with the averages for the other lids . So , therefore white paint is the better choice , especially if you are looking to keep the inside of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day .
25	10	3	3	white :: In the expirement is stated that lighter col ors are cooler than darker colors .White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot .
26	10	3	3	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much . Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it would keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool .
27	10	3	3	white :: if the dog house was white then when it is hot the dog house would be cooler .in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius .
29	10	3	3	black :: The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest .
35	10	3	3	white :: i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors ( dark gray , black , light gray ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) the sun reflects off of it so white would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white , what would u pick?
36	10	3	3	white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
40	10	3	3	white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house . I say this because the average temp of the color white is 42 ( DEG ) C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp .
41	10	3	3	white :: The color White might affect the inside of the doghouse by keeping it the coolest . The average for the color black was 53 ( DEG ) C , the average for Dark Grey was 48 ( DEG ) C , the average for Light Grey was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average for White was 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to keep the doghouse cool .
44	10	3	3	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outside . When the black lid was used in the expiriment , it was on average 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid , 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid , and 11 degrees warmer than the white . Therefore , if the doghouse is painted black , the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghouse was painted dark gray , light gray , or white .
58	10	3	3	dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer . the dark gray was an average of 48 ( DEG ) C which is not as hot as the black lid which was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45 ( DEG ) C .
60	10	3	3	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat . The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat , so it will keep the doghouse cooler .
63	10	3	3	white :: I think white would be the best color to paint the dog house . I say this because white absorbs less energy making the dog house cooler . In the experiment , the white on average was 42 ( DEG ) C , and that was the coolest temperature . The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53 ( DEG ) C . For a dog inside a doghouse , i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog , that's why I chose the color that made the doghouse the coolest .
83	10	3	3	white :: The best answer would be white because white is alight color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer . When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid on it , the temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . Whereas , when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 ( DEG ) C . That is an 11 ( DEG ) differance . There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white .
91	10	3	3	black :: By painting the doghouse black , the air inside the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color . In the experiment , the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53 ( DEG ) , which is 2 ( DEG ) higher than the dark grey lid , 8 ( DEG ) higher than the light grey lid , and 11 ( DEG ) higher than the white lids air temperature . This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it .
118	10	3	3	white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest because the other colors got tempatures of 53 ( DEG ) C , 48 ( DEG ) C , and 45 ( DEG ) C , but the white jar got 42 ( DEG ) C .
185	10	3	3	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compared to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
210	10	3	3	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so that the temperature inside will be cooler , because as tests show , white compared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius .
