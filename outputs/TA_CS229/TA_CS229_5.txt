5	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
5	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
5	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
