4	"""The word, """"invasive"""" plays a very important role in the article. Biologists, such as Skip Snow claim that these reptilian species of pythons and lizards are """"invasive"""". This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems. However, some such as RobRay MacInnes, argue otherwise, """"Invasive is the rod of the controversy over these reptiles."""
4	Invasive in the context of this article means species, such as the Burmese python and the Nile monitor lizard, do not have predators here in the U.S to hunt them. This is very significant because this means their numbers cannot be kept in check and they might overpopulate. Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species.
