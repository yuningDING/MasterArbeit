6	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.
6	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.
6	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
