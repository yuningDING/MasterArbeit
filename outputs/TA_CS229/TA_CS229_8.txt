Prompt	Text
8	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read. 'No school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
8	It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life.
8	In knowing Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul feels like the two can relate now. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his inability to read, Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This statement supports the fact that Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school.
