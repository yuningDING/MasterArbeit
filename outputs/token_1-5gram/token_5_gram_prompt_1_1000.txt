3020	1	0	0	The expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear from the procedure what the four different samples i'm determarning the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same for the rest, ^p after 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p sit and drt for 30 min. ^p 6) determines the mass of each sample. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount or the results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size. Also how much of each sample you were supposed to pour on each sample. ^p they also should  indicate the amount of vinegar poured into each container. 
3021	1	0	0	What is the temperature. Lastly, i would need to replicate this experiment, you would need to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much distilled water was used and what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.

3034	1	0	0	Keep the containers in. Also i would need to know the actual names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment, the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is what material i am putting in the container. In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and if i should measure it before i start. "
3035	1	0	0	It more clear include. Lastly, i need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of distilled water to rinse the samples under the distilled water? Also how long did you let the samples sit for 30 minutes, unless they all get different in at the same time. So, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, wood and plastic. 
3036	1	0	0	Procedure to replicate the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to inquire measurements of how much of the vinegar was poured into the containers. 
3037	1	0	0	Experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know what kind of vinegar to use and how big the containers need to do the experiment. Also, it is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. Then limestone it's in big change to other because it's heavy them other.

3049	1	0	0	It to come out. 
3050	1	0	0	You want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are 3 three important things or info that they need. A hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar to pour in the containers and the instruments you will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, you would actually need to know what types of samples are needed to be used. There should be a control included within the experiment. These 3 things would make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control and more trials. Also i need to know how big each container was the holds the samples. I would need to replicate the experiment i would need a better procedure that is
3051	1	0	0	 the procedure does not specify how much should be used. Instead of saying ""repeat"", it'd be better, and easier if it said exactly what to do. "
3052	1	0	0	 or a triple beam balance and i need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. The information that is needed to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in the containers how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water for? 
3053	1	0	0	How large should the samples be left for the 24 hours and how do you find the difference in the volume. If i weighed it differently we could get different results. 
3054	1	0	0	After experiment is over. 
3055	1	0	0	Need to what to weigh the samples with. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of the material they put in each sample. The last piece of information we would need is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the different containers. 
3056	1	0	0	Proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, what should the labels say on them, how big each container was. ^p 3) was there a control group in my experiment to see if it changes within the 24 hours. Another one is to list out the materials, more information is neccesary. The students should include the different names for the four samples. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount in each container, mass of them, in order to create more accurate data. 
3057	1	0	0	Would be a bar graph then i would give specific directions on what i did. But i would want to know how much vinegar? ^p -where could 2 find marbles and limestone? 
3058	1	0	0	Same to each cup. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate. 
3059	1	0	0	 where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass. Also when they say to put the sample. I would also need know how much vineger is being poured in the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3060	1	0	0	Why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass. 
3061	1	0	0	Were placed for the 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers. ^p 4. After 24 hours, where should it sit? In the reid?

3063	1	0	0	Then test it all over. 
3064	1	0	0	Procedure needs to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood, plastic, marble. 
3065	1	0	0	Included into the procedure to replicate it would have to tell what the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mass of the seperate samples at the end as well. 
3066	1	0	0	Sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, the amount of vinegar poured in each container. One would also need to know the size of the containers, what type of samples i use, the same applies to the vinegar, how much time you will need to retrieve when determining mass. However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required. 
3067	1	0	0	Other information to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
3068	1	0	0	Should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment. 
3069	1	0	0	Twice one in light room, one dark different temp. How should the containers be placed? 
3070	1	0	0	Same size to keep everything the same. You would also need to know how much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment. 
3071	1	0	0	They could make are ^p 1)have an exact amount of vinegar used in each container, the information to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much vinegar to the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, determine the difference in the masses.

3073	1	0	0	Three pieces of additional information that i would need to know what samples to test, not what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers at the same time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, i remove the samples from the containers with, where it listed the percentages post so that the reader knows where to go next. 
3074	1	0	0	Might change the results. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar to pour in the cups. If says after 24 hours remove the samples. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. 
3075	1	0	0	The dependent variable to understand the lab better.

3090	1	0	0	Starting mass so all of the samples. 
3091	1	0	0	Store the samples during the their in the containers and if i should measure it before i start. "
3092	1	0	0	To replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include the measurement of the containers ^p on statmen 4 how much water? ^p on number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the samples? That is not specified. The last piece of information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab. 
3093	1	0	0	Day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes. ^p  a. K.a :-amount of vinegar ^p                    -what kind of material the samples are made of ^p              2) to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container and also to include the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Another thing that would help is to know how many trials to do for each sample, for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly, i would also need to know what kind of samples they are. 
3094	1	0	0	On how to remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; i don't want to look for them in the results. 
3095	1	0	0	Temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse with distilled water. ""allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what the samples actually are of (what material). 
3096	1	0	0	The container with if it should be the same amount in all. More information is needed on what should be done to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 i would need the size of the rock sample to assure that the rock came in contact with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there should be the same. Also one must know how much of each material would you need in order to replicate the group's i would need to know what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They would need to do in order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the group should have the starting mass be the same for all four materials. 
3097	1	0	0	Three it should clarify which sample and how much of the sample that you are useing.

3100	1	0	0	Was no specification regarding the samples, but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then i would write a conclusion why this prblly happened. 
3101	1	0	0	This investigation took a lot of time to put together. So i know what im working on. Then starting mass. 
3102	1	0	0	Students recieved from the samples. Also the amount of vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in. You don't know if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know if you should cover the samples in the 4 seperate, but dentical containers. I would also need to know how much vinegar am i pouring in the containers. And finally, you would need to know what to weigh your sample on and if you should put the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing. 
3103	1	0	0	To measure it with. 
3104	1	0	0	We should subtract the differences in masses to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information. 
3105	1	0	0	Additional information i will need in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know is, what kind of containers they are. It tells you in the table but you wouldn't be given that along with the procedure. Finally, i would need to replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight. 
3106	1	0	0	Is one must add three things such as amount of each sample. 
3107	1	0	0	You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And last is to have a control group in my experiment to see if it effected the ending mass. Another thing that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about qv. Then when your done, hand it qn. 
3108	1	0	0	Sample to begin the experiment with and what to label each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You also would need to know is, how long you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples in because it may have an affect.

3113	1	0	0	Sample sit each cycle and i would need a measure of how much vinegar to pour on the rocks, the purpose and problem. I would also add more samples to the lab. Last, i would need to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container for 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit at when drying. ^p. Hypothesis would be needed. Also what to measure them in  and how much of each sample to use. 
3114	1	0	0	Are the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to know the type of vinegar used, how big each sample should be. This additional information would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are testing in the experiment. 
3115	1	0	0	Should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they should have a hypothisis.

3117	1	0	0	To determine how much vinegar is being poured in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be. 
3118	1	0	0	It than the others. This can also apply to the distilled water, without knowing how much vinegar to put in the four containers, you  would need in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to include where to record data. Finally, to improve these students labs i think the should expain the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You will also have to add in water what will have to be the same, and when it's finish to record the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too. 
3119	1	0	0	Will need to do to get data. What is the controll  for the experament ;

3128	1	0	0	Any repeating the trial. 
3129	1	0	0	Have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly. 
3130	1	0	0	3 or more trials to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container, or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment. 
3131	1	0	0	Missed was to gather all all the materials. 2) tell how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables, because some sample retain water better than others (wood, retains water better than plastic). There is a difference). Where should the container so far the of have i. E in a every regardless, room temperature
3132	1	0	0	Would place the sample in one container and label. Repeat w/remaining samples, placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat w/remaining samples, placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. 
3133	1	0	0	To the mass with out vinegar. You would need to know if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain. You would also need to know how many trials i would need to know the materials that are found in this procedure. One is, they did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples. They also should have added the amount of vinegar used in the container. Another piece of information i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how much of each sample to pour in the cups. You would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste. Lastly, i would first
3134	1	0	0	Vinegar can wash off. 
3135	1	0	0	Containers were that they used. In this case the dependant variable is the mass of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Another thing that would help is to know how vinegar you have to pour in the container. 
3136	1	0	0	Determine the outcome of the experiment. 
3137	1	0	0	The third mistake is how long do you rinse the sample off with distilled water. 
3138	1	0	0	And plastic to do this you would need to know what to do with the difference in masses. 
3139	1	0	0	Size contaner and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to pour in each container, where to to dry the samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data. 
3140	1	0	0	Each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar for each sample, how to measure the mass. 
3141	1	0	0	Record the starting and ending mass and start the experiment. The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record. 
3142	1	0	0	Know the age of the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the right label. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it is the same for all student samples. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed. 
3143	1	0	0	Leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours. 
3144	1	0	0	Should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing. 
3145	1	0	0	The containers and how long to rinse of the samples with the distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p what was the mass after 30 minutes. How the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate this experiment i would also need to know the mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know 2 things about the vinegar i would need to know is how big the container should be. Lastly, in order to repeat the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment drying. 
3146	1	0	0	If  there is a lot i'd need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood and plastic ) should be given, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You will need to know how how much  vinegar i should put into the four containers in step 2. Another piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the kind of sample, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container. ^p 2)they should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)and they should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end. 
3147	1	0	0	At the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible you need to know how much vinegar is used, and how do i measure the four samples. How to get the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass. Also, you would need to state how long to rinse the samples with. The measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material (wood, plastic, glass? We need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one. 
3148	1	0	0	Tested including independent and dependent variade. 
3149	1	0	0	A need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use. 
3150	1	0	0	Four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood, plastic)  because that's what the experiment is on. You would also need to know the substance used as the sample. I also would need to know which rock had the most mass, which would be all the sample in water and you would need a control. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size. Also i would need to know how long to rinse the sample. 
3151	1	0	0	Has on each of the samples before they were put in. 
3152	1	0	0	Many more pieces of information. ^p  a. K.a :-amount of vinegar ^p                       2. The amount of each sample. I'd also need to know in what condition i should plac the container in. It should also include what type of sample am i weighing. I need to exact amount of vinegar used, the amount of vinegar. They should also describe how to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind of samples to use, how much of the sample i would be weighing whether it be 50z, or 51bs the sample is not clear in the procedure. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be a control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period, or do you just leave them uncovered? 
3153	1	0	0	When rinsing each material. 
3154	1	0	0	Experiment are to know what the samples were. Secondly, you would need four samples. You would also need to know the equipment and the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment, you would need to repeat this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. Lastly, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches. 
3155	1	0	0	Vinegar they are pouring in to each sample, the measurements of how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What type of containers should you put the samples in. Some containers might not allow enough room for the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? Etc. I also think we should know what kind of environment the samples would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment. 
3156	1	0	0	After they took them out of the vinegar. 
3157	1	0	0	Know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did. 
3158	1	0	0	And then said reapet steps 3-6 so that it is clearer and easier to understand. 
3159	1	0	0	Beginning you need to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar. 
3160	1	0	0	They have atop and if they all are the same or different. 
3161	1	0	0	 replicate this expirement i woukd need to know what is meant by the word samples, in a dry, cold place etc. 
3162	1	0	0	Time for rinsing the samples. I would also need to know what object to put in what amount of vinegar is needed in each of the containers and how much of each sample to use, how much of the sample you put in the vinegar, it has to be in warm place or room temperature. This could effect the outcome of the experiment. Third, you will need to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers; how big or small the containers were. 
3163	1	0	0	How the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, they need to say where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period. 
3164	1	0	0	 for step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of the sample should be. A third additional information is needed to replicate the experiment more information is needed. First, i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container i would also add more samples to the lab. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these factors can make this experiment reprodurable. 
3165	1	0	0	Much of vinegar that would be poured into each containers. The students should have included the measurements used such as amount of vinegar poured into each container. Also, they need to tell you how much each sample should be. A third piece of information needed would be where the containers are to sit. ^p the procedure says that the containers should each be labeled, or what ""materials"" to put in the container. I also need to know if i should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram. 
3166	1	0	0	Only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container. 
3167	1	0	0	The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic placed in a distilled water esp for 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate. 
3168	1	0	0	A conclusion to the problem. 
3169	1	0	0	Label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, what kind of container i'll be using. When determining the mass (grarns). 
3170	1	0	0	Each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment. 
3171	1	0	0	Have included the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment. Also you need to know why you are doing the experiment, you would need to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. An experiment that is replicated may not always be exact, but the procedure does not specify how much vinegar to put into each container & what the other materials would be. These would help because will not them you don't know which are to use, and which type of scale would i use? 
3172	1	0	0	With vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and determine the mass. 
3173	1	0	0	Be the right label. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered. The starting mass of each sample. 
3174	1	0	0	After they put the vinegar and materials in it. 
3175	1	0	0	Need to put in the containers, need a scale and a type of vinegar. 
3176	1	0	0	Mass between each object. 
3177	1	0	0	Said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used. 
3178	1	0	0	Is to remember to write in the procedure to replicate this experiment, you should measure the mass of each sample. ^p        2) to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. How much vinegar to add the containers, and make sure its the same type of samples they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed in order to replicate this experiment, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same. 
3179	1	0	0	With each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Also, you would need to know what 4 different samples i needed, what kind of containers and how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed into. 
3180	1	0	0	Are you would need. I would also need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in each container. 
3181	1	0	0	Was really the vinegar affecting the mass. Also record the ending mass. 
3182	1	0	0	To dry for different amount of time. And creat a lable the somewhere
3183	1	0	0	To why they are preforming this experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples. 
3184	1	0	0	If all the containers got the same amount of the sample placed in the container in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the containers so they get the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. Even more lastly, youoneed to know what youre measuring the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on one sample than another, it might change the weight and how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry
3185	1	0	0	Put a sample of a material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples. 
3186	1	0	0	Replicate is because you dont know what they were doing this experiment, i would need to know how to mass the samples and what environment they should be left in the light or dark? If i were to follow the procedure the group wrote, i would need to know what type of wood and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment, what is the problem that i am suppose to attempt to solve. Also they should have a hypothisis. 
3187	1	0	0	Note each sample with distilled water. Also, how the samples should be put, rather light or dark, because this effects the outcome. 
3188	1	0	0	Must include the amount of vinegar poured into the containers. Lastly, how do we determine the mass of the samples. 
3189	1	0	0	Four identical containers were, how much vinegar to pour in. They all have starting mass and end mass, and the temperature. 
3190	1	0	0	Know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. An experiment that is replicated may not always be exact, but the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are in the procedure and if i was to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of expirment  theie results. 
3191	1	0	0	Of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. 
3192	1	0	0	Knowing this information i would be able to replicate the experiment i would need to know at what time the experiment started and ended. 
3193	1	0	0	Since it does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They need to say how much vinegar. I would also need to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment. What should i remove the samples with? (tongs)
3194	1	0	0	Each sample be placed in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, warm, cold, in the sun? 
3195	1	0	0	Identified is the amount of vinegar someone should put in each cup and how big of a sample to test in the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over. 
3196	1	0	0	In mass at the end of experiment. 
3197	1	0	0	Of the starting mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, so that when replicated the same samples will be used. 
3198	1	0	0	Tell how they rinsed the samples. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to replicate this experiment, i would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer. 
3199	1	0	0	To make the directions more clear. There should also be specification about how much vinegar or rock sam plquantity also using cleaner numbers would make iteasyer to recreate and read. 
3200	1	0	0	What they were made of and what samples they used. They should also put down to try this two or three times all together  so we have more than one of the tables to read. 
3201	1	0	0	To mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment. 
3202	1	0	0	Four containers be for the samples. They did not say what to do with the data. 
3203	1	0	0	They did not table the four identical containers, which changes the mass of each sample. 
3204	1	0	0	Dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass i got at the end culd compared it to the mass i got at the end culd compared it to the mass i got in the begeing vig. 
3205	1	0	0	May need a band or ocuple of ances and i would need to know what to use to determine the mass of each sample. 
3206	1	0	0	 for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly, i would need to know what i must use to take out the sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment. 
3207	1	0	0	Know how vinegar you have to pour on each container. In their procedure, it doesn't state it clearly. 
3208	1	0	0	Be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined. 
3209	1	0	0	Also will need four containers and my four samples. I also need to know how long to rinse of the samples with. Right now this information is vague. 
3210	1	0	0	A tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3211	1	0	0	Mass to the ending mass. Another thing you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about, what type of untensil to use to measure the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in. Also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples are in the procedure, the students need to be more suspific as to say what the samples are and you need to know why they chose the four samples that are needed, were, does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the open or the outside. 
3212	1	0	0	Could also impact result. The group also needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator. 
3213	1	0	0	And amounts of how much vinegar to put in. The last thing they need to mention in this procedure is. How much of the sample to put in the container, the more densely packed the samples are. ^p you need to know that i had to measure the mass of each samples be the same. 
3214	1	0	0	And last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process. 
3215	1	0	0	Also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass. 
3216	1	0	0	Have to say which samples to use. Am i using a bucket, a beaker or what? Do i put all the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again. 
3217	1	0	0	The students also need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose. 
3218	1	0	0	Samples that are being tested. It is impossible to know if the starting mass for the materials all arent the same. 
3219	1	0	0	Variable to the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles? 
3220	1	0	0	To have known why were they doing this experiment? ^p why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p and for me to replicate this group's experiment i would have to know how much distilled water to use and how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also, the procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, this procedure does not state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is put in each of the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse each sample with after the
3221	1	0	0	Dry and a tripple beam ballance scale. 
3222	1	0	0	To be told in the procedure what kind of sample and how much is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass. 
3223	1	0	0	Of vinegar can change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, more trials of the experiment and a conclusion. 
3224	1	0	0	Heaviest at the begining and the end. 
3225	1	0	0	Four samples used in the experiment. You also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each containers. In able to complete this experiment. 
3226	1	0	0	Another thing would be how your going to weigh it. 
3227	1	0	0	Have to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet. 
3228	1	0	0	What they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table. In this they say to place a sample of one material into one container & label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. In step 2 i would need to where to store the experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be a more specific description of mass, limestone, wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and determine the mass of each of the samples being marbles of any kind. Also, they should add more specific. 
3229	1	0	0	Have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures. 
3230	1	0	0	I never knew that you can have negative grams. 
3231	1	0	0	Supposed to sit for. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table. 
3232	1	0	0	Be put into the containers. You also should know how long to rinse the samples. 
3233	1	0	0	Or not the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar. 
3234	1	0	0	Of steps so what youcan know what you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat. Another one is to list out the materials, what kind of samples to use, such as  wood or marble. A third piece of information needed to replicate this experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass. 
3235	1	0	0	A negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured in each cup, the temperature of vineger, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much time you will need to know how much vinegar to the top of the container specified just a little bit. 
3236	1	0	0	Starting weight of the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials. 
3237	1	0	0	Mass of the 4 samples, what are the measurements for all this, how much of the vinegar is tuching it. 
3238	1	0	0	This step i would need to replicate this experiment u would have to try & use many different samples. ^p 2) how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. The should include determine the ending mass. 
3239	1	0	0	Or froze the samples, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. Then limestone it's in big change to other because it's heavy them other. 
3240	1	0	0	Should we use and how long to rinse the samples. 
3241	1	0	0	Also a control to see what would happen. 
3242	1	0	0	It out of their processes. 
3243	1	0	0	Four samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional information is needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar to put in the vinegar. 
3244	1	0	0	Of container and the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. 
3245	1	0	0	The identical containers are made of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should add another step which should state that they should run atleast 3 trials so that their information could be accurate. 
3246	1	0	0	Use for placing the samples in. 
3247	1	0	0	A key variable to it's success. 
3248	1	0	0	That it should be stated where to put the label on the material itself, on the cup, how they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else. 
3249	1	0	0	Place to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat. 
3250	1	0	0	Stating how things should be measured by saying 'measure mass on a tripple-beam balance"" etc. "
3251	1	0	0	After 24 hours measure mass and record all the data. )
3252	1	0	0	Not enough to direw a conclusion. Say what sample to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
3253	1	0	0	This experiment and they need to add the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment. 
3254	1	0	0	Would double the hours to see what would happen. 
3255	1	0	0	The group used in order to get the actual mass for each sample if it's the same or not, as this would affect the amount of mass was that amount
3256	1	0	0	The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the experiment, the problem that you are experimenting, dependent variable, and even a graph to explain their results better. 
3257	1	0	0	For how long. How much the container have to be. 
3258	1	0	0	Is in the water. 
3259	1	0	0	Vinegar that is being poured in the container. 
3260	1	0	0	Three times to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment. 
3261	1	0	0	Not write step 3 because the container, how big should the samples be left for the 24 hours and at what temperature. I should have the exact type of material. Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area. 
3262	1	0	0	Also want to test all these four samples in water as a control, which would he grams as shown in the data table, but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. The final thing would be that the amount of vinegar poured into each container. They should have said how much vinegar to add in each of the containers. Another piece of information you need is what size container should be used? 
3263	1	0	0	I will have to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the samples would be like in room temperature or in hot and colder area, new to determine the mass? 
3264	1	0	0	To determin what the materials were, the size of the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you suppost to experiment on them. There should be a list of possible samples. 
3265	1	0	0	To test permeability at the samples. Should they all be the same. Wood had highest starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
3266	1	0	0	Procedure it should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment. They need to tell you what you are using what kind of containers were used and if they would effect the masses or the samples. 
3267	1	0	0	Should be needed to pass on the samples. The purpose of this experiment if so i would need a better procedure that is
3268	1	0	0	Explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. 
3269	1	0	0	After let them dry for a certain time. 
3270	1	0	0	All the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be stated in procedures), and the device used to measure the work samples. 
3271	1	0	0	Samples that you putting in the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3272	1	0	0	The samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does, and what the samples are, how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is not specific enough by just saying ""four different sample"". In step two they should say how much vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level. You say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off. 
3273	1	0	0	Rins it off and measure without the viniger. 
3274	1	0	0	Much be a certain size
3275	1	0	0	Goes with what container? 
3276	1	0	0	Not write step 3 because the container, the size or amount of each sample needed. Finally, they should have also added more trials as well as controlled variables are needed. "
3277	1	0	0	Kind of  lime and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger. 
3278	1	0	0	Rinse each container with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was. 
3279	1	0	0	Student observations and you would need to know what was in each of the 4 containers. "
3280	1	0	0	Certain temperature that the samples were to be placed in the same location temperature as the others. "
3281	1	0	0	You that this investigation took a lot of time to put together. So i know what kind of instrurrent is used to measure the 4 different materials are that i'd be testing. In addition, i would need to know how much of one sample material do they want, and how much mass you are using what the samples are in the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of the containers. With what am i going to need. 
3282	1	0	0	With the right information to answer the problem. Another piece of information needed in order to replicate the groups procedure would be the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment. 
3283	1	0	0	 the group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant. 
3284	1	0	0	Measuring tool you are using to measure the mass. 
3285	1	0	0	Sure the surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area. 
3286	1	0	0	Scale so that the mass can be removed. 
3287	1	0	0	At for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight. 
3288	1	0	0	Is not very specific in their procedures. In step 2, the procedure should state how much vinegar was put in each cup. Lastly, it says to put vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not identify how much vinegar goes into each container. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the control, if any. Third, you would also need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. The last piece of additional information would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each? What tool did they use to test each sample and also how much
3289	1	0	0	 in able to have the experiment preesse. 
3290	1	0	0	1 indicates to determine the mass of the samples. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, in the procedures i nade need to what to weigh the samples with. The right factor is also important. The students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass. 
3291	1	0	0	In case they mess up, they can change the type of water that they use in step 4 to make a difference. 
3292	1	0	0	 write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record. 
3293	1	0	0	Is that i would need is how to determine the mass of each sample you would need to know what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, i would want to know is how big each of the containers as well as how much vinegar, what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples. 
3294	1	0	0	Procdure also does not state hou much vinegar buc in the cups. In measuring the 4 different samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the samples are that you are using. All they say is, get the same starting mass, then you would have to remove the samples from the containers, do they want us to use the same amount of vinegar in each of 4 seperate, but identical containers. I also need to know the size of each container. Also, they should specify how much a single sample is. They don't state how they find the mass of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the object at the end. Also, what are they? They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours sitting. Also you do not know what
3295	1	0	0	A control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers? And how much vinegar to use, how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass, also what type of container, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of each sample hey. 
3296	1	0	0	Going to end the mass, i will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass. 
3297	1	0	0	Is where you let them sit for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, i would need the same amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples to after 24 hours. 
3298	1	0	0	Starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass, ending mass and difference is very important to know in order to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples and how much you need. The last thing is that, 
3299	1	0	0	Meed to know how much distilled water you would uses for each container to rinse it off, after 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record. 
3300	1	0	0	Have to be equal to get the best results. 
3301	1	0	0	The materials or use natural resources. 
3302	1	0	0	Between the starting ending mass in the data findings. 
3303	1	0	0	You place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment. Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from? 
3304	1	0	0	Describe the independent and dependent variables as well as the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. It also just says ""samples"" and doesn't specify what the samples should dry in, like a scale, cups the samples, so that your result will be more accurate. Also instead of containers use glass bottles. 
3305	1	0	0	This expirement i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart. 
3306	1	0	0	The information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, i would need to know what samples i am sopost to use, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. Also, in the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
3307	1	0	0	Of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment. 
3308	1	0	0	The samples that was used. Also, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. That is what we would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container, the samples i would also need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin. 
3309	1	0	0	Container should be in there. They should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass. 
3310	1	0	0	They should name and list the samples that you putting in the container. 
3311	1	0	0	Vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated. 
3312	1	0	0	Compete with your findings. And last info that i would need to know would include several things. First, starting mass, they could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, g, etc. You will need to let the sample sit each cycle and i would need to know were the samples were. You also need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container. In addition, knowing the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what i'm looking for. 
3313	1	0	0	How big the materials were that they used. Another piece of information that they did not add in, was how much viniger was poured in each container and i would of listed how to find the mass of each sample. 
3314	1	0	0	Information is not given until the data table was shown. 
3315	1	0	0	Were chosen and if there should be multiple trials. The experiment was written decently. 
3316	1	0	0	Need to be rinsed with distilled water, you could also add  how much vinegar are they adding to each container, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples being experimented on. I'm not sure if they all are the same or different. 
3317	1	0	0	Trials of each of the samples after they dried. Without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table. 
3318	1	0	0	Containers get same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
3319	1	0	0	In step two it does not tell you how to way each sample's mass. 
3320	1	0	0	Is to describe the four samples you are using, how to write down the findings. 
3321	1	0	0	Also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, as well as how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. You also need to know what is they were trying to figure not ^p, 2nd you need to know the temperature of the enviroment the samples are in the procedure, they needed to say how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -the mass of the different sampes such as what would i use to determine how much vinegar you need to pour on the samples. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples with distilled water? Those are the information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, i would need to order to replicate the experiment the same way so i would also
3322	1	0	0	What we were getting the mass of. 
3323	1	0	0	The 4 containers as? How much of the samples to see how much grams it had gained with the material. 
3324	1	0	0	Know how much weight of the sample to put into the containers. 
3325	1	0	0	Knowing there independent and dependent variable and whats has to be constant. Another thing you would need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other. 
3326	1	0	0	Of been the same. Next, the group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar to put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment. 
3327	1	0	0	C for example white, apple material. Also, you would need additional information like how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what shape the samples should be stored. For example, i would include the brand of vinegar, 
3328	1	0	0	Out some information that is needed to replicate this experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, the amount of vinegar i should put in each container. The four different samples, the students should also include what device they're finding the mass of the marble went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."
3329	1	0	0	 wet environment or maybe warm & dry. 
3330	1	0	0	For is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in each container. Also how much water was in each cup, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, to improve these students labs i think the should expain the list of materials they have to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment. Also for it to be repcated. It will give you the mass of the samples were used. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would need to replicate the procedure i or anybody else would need the following information. What are the sample, decide what container to put the sample. ^p 7) clean up where you worked. 
3331	1	0	0	Need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass. 
3332	1	0	0	 they also included only the trial. "
3333	1	0	0	The container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples. What are the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment would be things like the mass of each sample. 
3334	1	0	0	The procedure where it should be stated where to put the samples in. Some containers might not allow enough room for the samples. 
3335	1	0	0	Also in step 3 it tells you to place each sample in the same size contaner and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p for step four how do you remove the samples from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water for. Finally, i need to exact amount of vinegar used in their experiment. 
3336	1	0	0	At in the 24 hour period. ^p lastly, i would need to know the amount of vinegar used in the container. What the mass of the samples. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything. 
3337	1	0	0	For  what is the name of the sample material. 
3338	1	0	0	Error is that step 4 is too vague. It says ""pour vinegar"", there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out with the investigation. Finally, to tell what material or size the four identical containers. 3) place a sample of one material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know what are the samples? They don't tell us what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of them. 
3339	1	0	0	Would also like to know how much vinegar to add to each of the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container, if i had only looked at the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table. 
3340	1	0	0	Containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours. Also, the group does not show that the samples sat in and how they got the answer of what they are going to use min their procedure and they should also say exactly how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you need a control to look back on, you would need to no exactly how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside, for me to be able to recreate this experiment. 
3341	1	0	0	But hav then sit less. They could of extended the time. Also i would need to know the ph of the vinegar, needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar they poured into the container and what type of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble, limestone, wood and plastic they used since there isn't one kind of each. ^p 7). Record your data. Also, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass. 
3342	1	0	0	Also how many times you have to do. 
3343	1	0	0	But in the beginning they also forgot to state their hypothesis but in the beginning they also forgot to say the amount of water the samples are rinsed with. 
3344	1	0	0	More contact with  the vinegar, how to determine the mass, which you should. 
3345	1	0	0	Temperature or in hot and colder area, new to determine the mass of each of the four containers. ^p - what kind of containers they used. More trials for each sample to have the same amount of mass for each object. 
3346	1	0	0	The procedur what you are using to find the mass of the samples. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar needed, the size of the samples. The put the four different samples. 
3347	1	0	0	Leave samples for 20 hours. I would also need to know how much of the sample to start with, how much of such sample should be used. 
3348	1	0	0	Or any other measurement. 
3349	1	0	0	If the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment. In order to replicate the experiment i would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment also needs trials. 
3350	1	0	0	Replicate the experiment accurately. "
3351	1	0	0	Fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with. 
3352	1	0	0	They pour into each containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. 
3353	1	0	0	Step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be added to each container. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Also, they do not mention how much vinegar should be poured into the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into a container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours. "
3354	1	0	0	Would need several more pieces of information in order to perform the experiment would be to identify how much vinegar goes in each sample. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate. 
3355	1	0	0	This contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area. 
3356	1	0	0	Should add more informations of, the temperature of the room should be. This additional information would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials. "
3357	1	0	0	Actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate. 
3358	1	0	0	The containers that you would place the sample in, how much vinegar to pour into each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar. 
3359	1	0	0	Be to do more trials. This would be done by placing each sample into 4 more containers with no vinegar. To use. How much of such sample should be used in each container and also to include the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Another thing you would need to replicate the experiment. 
3360	1	0	0	State the samples you need to use. 
3361	1	0	0	Samples you were using. Also, the students will have to add what the four examples are in the procedures, the materials and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of the four and how long  containers, stickers for labeling. A watch or timer and paper for it to dry. 
3362	1	0	0	Vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things. 
3363	1	0	0	What material are are the 4 different samples that i am investigating? I would also need to know how much vinegar was used and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on. 
3364	1	0	0	Most different in the mass. What containers should we use? 
3365	1	0	0	Used for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information missing from the procedure is the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of each. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment. You will need the same amount of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar i needed to pour into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment you would need to
3366	1	0	0	Another good peice of information would be a control. Another think is that how many samples to put in one container. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers. 
3367	1	0	0	No control which would make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control set up, and an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be because if the containers are dry, it can change the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even performing this experiment. 
3368	1	0	0	If i just poured vinegar into four cups, the amounts would be different and it could change the experiments outcome. Also in step 4 i would need the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how  they determined the mass and how much of each material. The would need and the substance size. 
3369	1	0	0	 the size or amount of each sample needs to be placed in each container. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it is the same amount for each. In order to replicate the group's procedure. We would also have to pour the same amount of the experience because it is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample/ or vinegar you using and water/check it out often times to see if it changes within the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure would that base to
3370	1	0	0	Procedure is the size of the container. 
3371	1	0	0	Should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as a rock in just water. 
3372	1	0	0	Is in their procedure they dont tell what the samples aren't. If you don't have this information, replicating the experiment would be how much vinegar to add in each container and i would also need to know what are good samples to use for this investigation so i can replicate the acid rain experiment, i would need to replicate this experiment you would need to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know a few more things. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. You would also need to know them too. 
3373	1	0	0	For 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. 
3374	1	0	0	In each single container, you would need to know how much vinegar do you put in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the samples. Also, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the containers, how much water do you rinse it with in question4, also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers. ^p 3.you would need to measure the mass of the sample. 
3375	1	0	0	Much vinegar was present in the containers and you need to determine the mass. They got information, but it does not specify how much vinegar is to be poured. Also what would those 4 materials be. It would be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. Also when they say to put the sample in and how much vinegar  to put in each of four seprate containers and how long the experiment is, tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it would have  been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure. 
3376	1	0	0	 how large were the samples and what size containers should be used. 
3377	1	0	0	 in starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too. So it's in no change. In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's in difference beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change. In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's in difference beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change. Then limestone it's in big change to other because it's heavy them other. 
3378	1	0	0	 what the four samples they were testing were. Also, they need to tell exactly what samples (rocks). They need to have every piece of information in the procedure, how much vinegar, what containers are made of and its size, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also, how much vinegar you would need to know what the four materials are, so their names would have to be to clarify in the first step. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, a few pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are that are being used. Their procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples in this experiment. First, the materials marble, limestone, plastic was not writen
3379	1	0	0	Conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also does not tell us what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material. 
3380	1	0	0	Place in each container. In step 2, you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles. 
3381	1	0	0	I think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a problem statement said also be necessary. 
3382	1	0	0	Precise on what they are saying for example, the marble, limestone, wood and plastic). You would also need the samples to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such. 
3383	1	0	0	In each and you need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and difference in mass. The other additional information needed is the name of the different samples. 
3384	1	0	0	This experiment would be the different samples used. How much vinegar i'm suppose to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in. The last piece of information i would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the room, freezer were. They all so could of told use if they used move traits or not. 
3385	1	0	0	Samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period. 
3386	1	0	0	Trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.

3390	1	0	0	The last step states, to determine the mass of four different samples. I would need to know what materials to use, the students could have done more trials to get better observations. 
3391	1	0	0	You leashneed to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, they do not mention how much vinegar should be added to the procedure is what the samples were in the procedure and how big they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into the four separate containers. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I would follow the procedure step by step. It would also help to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. The procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data. 
3392	1	0	0	All the stuff off or just get it a little wet. 
3393	1	0	0	I use and how long to rinse the samples with, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know how much vinger to put in each cup and how much of the sample to use.

3403	1	0	0	Needs to be made clear. 
3404	1	0	0	What i will measure the samples in to find their mass. Also i would need to know what the samples are. They should do more than just one container, it should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed. Furthermore, it would be easier to determine the difference in the mass at the end of the experiment. In other words, the purpose and problem. I would need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on the results.

3419	1	0	0	To subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them. 
3420	1	0	0	Of vinegar before the experiment, i would have to determine the mass of the four different samples that are going to used experiment on. They need to put the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar used, all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity. 
3421	1	0	0	Would also have been useful if the group would have said how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass, also students may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, wood acid wester. The size of the samples, how much water you place into each sample and you would need to know some additional information. They need to include what the samples are of. We would also need equal amount of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in non-identical container so you could know which is which. When recording the mass i will not know which belongings
3422	1	0	0	Just calculating the mass of the end and how long to rinse the distilled water and lastly, they shouldn't use the already used material to replicate the experiment you may want to know what size of containers i should hecking for this experiment. 
3423	1	0	0	They do the or what ri they use. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab. 
3424	1	0	0	That contained  only the procedure, the actual names of each of the building material. The final thing is that i think with starting and ending mass. Without these you cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then i need to place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container for 24 hours, and a triple beam balance. 
3425	1	0	0	Sample you should be taking. If they were to replicate this experiment would be what you would use to find the mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they are doing to make this experiment better they could of had more trial. 
3426	1	0	0	Have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment, the amount of vinegar should be placed in each container. 
3427	1	0	0	Of information that they did not add in the procedure is they should state what samples will be used. 
3428	1	0	0	Place the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab. 
3429	1	0	0	These three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how long the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, which should also be in the procedure. It doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you would need to know how they determined the mass of the four samples. I would also want to know the size of the container. What the four samples are. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass. 
3430	1	0	0	And what amount of each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container. Another information
3431	1	0	0	 then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, they need to not write step 3 because the container, say if there was any repeating the trial. 
3432	1	0	0	Students recieved from the samples. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water. "
3433	1	0	0	Different ph along with the amount of vinegar to put in. Also when it says place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container. After the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph/chart. 
3434	1	0	0	Step where you find the starting mass and the difference in mass. 
3435	1	0	0	The experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than than, this experiment is the mass of the material. How much vinegar to use. Another good peice of information would be how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly i need distilled water for the sample's and i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would  also need to know how to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar. 
3436	1	0	0	When replicating the experiment. Third, we need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample atthe start. 
3437	1	0	0	Sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group also needs to state if the containers should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, and it is very important to know in the procedure that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. Place the materials into the containers and what size, how many containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment over. 
3438	1	0	0	Vinegar they are pouring in to each sample. Also, you will need top know how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't have trials of testing. 
3439	1	0	0	Need to control group and you need to know what the given materials are. One would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as not to ruin the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar inorder to perform the experiment. These are the things i would need to know what type if container to use. Then, i would need to know more about the containers, and how to measure the mass of the samples or not. 
3440	1	0	0	Take the time and i also think that i need the measure of the four mass samples. Also, the procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are. The amount of vinegar is used in each. 
3441	1	0	0	Imost they had bett. Where how much vinegar did they pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not say how to find the mass, you need to know the age of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will be easier to follow. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the mass of materials. This information would make sure that i get the same answers. 
3442	1	0	0	Not expressed in the procedure. Instead of using vinegar, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing i would need to know in order to repeat the experiment step by step. It would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each sample. They also shuld include the amount of each sample. 
3443	1	0	0	When the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. 
3444	1	0	0	Difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment. First, the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples were. In addition you would need to know that. 
3445	1	0	0	Then your lab might cam out wrong. 
3446	1	0	0	Did you put in each cup. It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Lastly they needed to state how much of the sample i should be using. Lastly you would need to know some additional information. First, i would have to know what the samples are. In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass. Last, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times re repeat the experiment for valitity. Also, the students used, you would need to know how big each of the containers. To replicate the experiment, i would need to replicate the expirement we would need amount of vinegar used in their experiment
3447	1	0	0	No numeric values such as how much vinegar to put in each container. This may effect the amount of mass each has. 
3448	1	0	0	You will need during this experiment. You would also need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much vinegar was put onto each sample. Without these, i could not precesily replicate the experiment. 
3449	1	0	0	Not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence. 
3450	1	0	0	Items of material were put into each container, how the mass is being calculated. 
3451	1	0	0	Should be specification about how big the containers are, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result. 
3452	1	0	0	Others understand the experiment better. 
3453	1	0	0	How much water torince the samples with. 
3454	1	0	0	That vinegar is what changes the mass, or what ""materials"" to put in the container. I would need to know a saw things. I would also need to know what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers. ^p (2)  how much vinegar to pour in to each container- this could effect the outcome of the experiment. 
3455	1	0	0	 another thing needed was the names of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. Lastly, it is also important that they include how much or how long to rinse or how much water to use when you rinse each sample with distilled water. And don't dry the samples. 
3456	1	0	0	The samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day. 
3457	1	0	0	Take the sample out of the cup. Also the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.another thing is for them to how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of their containers. You also need to know how much vinegar they poured into each container. What type of woods, plastic, marble. 
3458	1	0	0	Be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, how much water should be used to  use the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment, you would need to find out the difference in mass(g). 
3459	1	0	0	That this experiment will need to tell how much vinegar was used, how big they are. Also, what are the sample, in four separate, but different containers. 
3460	1	0	0	State the size of the container. 
3461	1	0	0	Would be placed in water. (ex 5 minutes)
3462	1	0	0	Record each sample and the difference between the starting mass and ending mass and the difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in each container? And as always, what are the samples;marble, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure. Finally, they need to include marble, limestone, wood, and plastic are for. 
3463	1	0	0	Began and the time they ended at. 
3464	1	0	0	Were using because it could of been any type, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and they don't say what we use or how to find the difference in mass. In the procedure, is what the four samples are, how big would the containers need to do the trials to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure. "
3465	1	0	0	Have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) determines the mass of each sample, how to weigh the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about qv. Then when you finish how much vinigar was added to the container, the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also need to know what the four different samples which is marble, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. In starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too. So it's in no change. Then limestone it's in big change to other because it's heavy them other. 
3466	1	0	0	Measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. I would also need to record the size of each sample, for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly, we need to know how many pieces of each sample are going to be used, and how much of each of these substances they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab. 
3467	1	0	0	Things would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same. The materials i am working with. Also, i would need to know how long to rinse the samples for. Finally, you'd need to know what samples they used. They would also need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the containers. The amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Another part that needs more information is step 2, what type of container and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. Which is a centered post or any experiment. They should also say how much water they used to rinse each sample. 
3468	1	0	0	Group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the sample. In the procedure, the additional information that will be needed is the starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals. 
3469	1	0	0	And samples the experiment finished. 
3470	1	0	0	Samples after taking them out of the vinegar. Also, what should the labels say on them, how much space in containers and how much of each material. Also it never said that the samples were put in the vinegar. Also you would need to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar to use in order to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have the containers in. 
3471	1	0	0	Vital area in this experiment. 
3472	1	0	0	Want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the size of the container. 
3473	1	0	0	Are a list of the four samples, i would've had each sample weigh the same at the begining of the experiment. Adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough by just saying ""four different sample"". In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar added to the samples. 
3474	1	0	0	End say to record what you have found out. Also i would want to know how they determined the masses of the samples? "
3475	1	0	0	The highest mass in acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us. 
3476	1	0	0	My results could change if i use a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples. 
3477	1	0	0	Sample would be sitting in the same amount of the experience because it is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample/ or vinegar you using and water/check it out often times to see if your results change. 
3478	1	0	0	 pecific mersurements will help also. 
3479	1	0	0	Of containers to put the samples on to sit and dry. 
3480	1	0	0	What four examples should we whaz or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do. 
3481	1	0	0	The materials so that you could know what they are comparing. 
3482	1	0	0	Very detailed because some people might not understand. 
3483	1	0	0	An affect on how the samples are removed from the vineger. 
3484	1	0	0	Know that so the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you can get the exact amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Another part that needs more information is step 2, what type of container, how to determine the mass of each sample. 
3485	1	0	0	The starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it. 
3486	1	0	0	Type of materials you need. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The procedure needs to include how much vinegar to put in each container. In their procedure, it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the mass. The third additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass. 
3487	1	0	0	Independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control. 
3488	1	0	0	We need  to know the amount of vinegar, the sample size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. 
3489	1	0	0	Thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out with the investigation. Finally, i would need to know what type of containers. 
3490	1	0	0	There is a risk of the data being invalid. 
3491	1	0	0	Statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. 
3492	1	0	0	Variables are because if all of the variables that need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you need to know how lag of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much sample for each cup and how much distilled water to rinse each sample. 
3493	1	0	0	Students did not state how much vinegar to pour into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data the group of students should have mentioned in their procedures what four samples to use. Also, they should name and list the samples that you putting in the container and another thing that they should add is the amount of vinegar used. Another thing you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each cup. It would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate. 
3494	1	0	0	As some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container for each sample. Lastly, at the end after you determine the mass. What unit of measurement has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to be and how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. I would also need to know the four different  samples without knowing that i don't know what the samples are while the data table identifies them, it is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of samples not just their mass. I would need to know which materials to use. Also, if you need to use
3495	1	0	0	The mass can be removed. 
3496	1	0	0	Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3497	1	0	0	Also they could add what temprature they left the material in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing you would need to know what i must use to take out the sample. Would i use my hands or tongs? 
3498	1	0	0	Your looking for in these materials, such as if they  dissolved or grew. 
3499	1	0	0	Information in order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know how lag of a container to use. Also, the procedure doesn't say what size container i would use for each of the four containers so we know how much to pour into the container. They also could have done different trials of the experiment, the group should add a hypothesis, the materials marble, limestone, wood and plastic) to use. They show  4 samples in the data table. Also what siz container. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water to use and how much vinegar needs to be added to each container. Finally each starting mass should be the same. Also, there should be a list of possible samples. 
3500	1	0	0	Three things i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. By having this information, replicating the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result. 
3501	1	0	0	Vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put in, should be added in the four separate containers. You would also need to know how much of the samples to container. 
3502	1	0	0	Effective reaction on the samples. This additional information would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are testing in the experiment. 
3503	1	0	0	Have an average for the data. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass. Wood didn't change at all. Wedon't even know what to use to do it. You would also want to know the size of the single containers and you need to record tour data. 
3504	1	0	0	Thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass. 
3505	1	0	0	Know how to compare the mass of each sample. 
3506	1	0	0	Be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample. Without these, i could compare my results in it. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They did not say when to record the mass of 4 different samples should be the same. 
3507	1	0	0	Amount of water the samples are rinsed with. 
3508	1	0	0	Students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate this experiment, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar poured in each container. You need to know the mass of the sample, decide what container to put the vinegar in. Also i need the names of the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, they must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar to pour into each container. Also, what type of vinegar to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be rinsed with. As well as needing to know how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker ph level. You say
3509	1	0	0	Need to add is to include a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This group should have included, in their procedure, it didn't  tell what the different samples are, and what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this. 
3510	1	0	0	To get organized and gather all information to be able to do this experiment and what it is trying to prove? 
3511	1	0	0	This experiment with only the procedure, the samples of the items should be added in the four separate containers. ^p after 24 hours, if they should all start out with the same mass at the start. 
3512	1	0	0	Have to be more specific with the samples. 
3513	1	0	0	Information an over again to see if i get the same answers. 
3514	1	0	0	The sample to put in the four cups with vinegar. 
3515	1	0	0	To place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know what type of container to put the material in. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles. 
3516	1	0	0	Materials should be given. 
3517	1	0	0	The students data that was recorded. The procedure does not tell you how much vinnegar to put in the container. You would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be the same mass. 
3518	1	0	0	The measurements of vinegar poored into each of the four containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not. 
3519	1	0	0	Are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know more clearly how to do each step. 
3520	1	0	0	All we should also know how long we rinse the samples for. Finally, at the end of expirment  theie results. 
3521	1	0	0	The procedure would also have to measure each sample before and after doing, the lab will be more accurate. Also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing. 
3522	1	0	0	The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. ^p (3) is every samples sit and dry. 
3523	1	0	0	Type of result you were looking for. 
3524	1	0	0	What to measure them in  and how much mass you are using what kind of containers to use or how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the samples masses. All this helps to replicate the experiment, why should we do it, what do you use to measure the mass in grams and i wouldn't be able to replicate the expirement wald be an accurate mesurement of vinegar being pared into the containers. And what am i wanting to replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger. 
3525	1	0	0	Was finish what was the mass. ^p *ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion. 
3526	1	0	0	To be  more information in the procedure. 
3527	1	0	0	And record the ending mass. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab. 
3528	1	0	0	So that variations in the amount of vinegar to pour into the samples. You also would need to know what are the samples you should use, what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass, also what kind of container and how large it should be, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container i would also add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic? ).
3529	1	0	0	Dependent variable to understand the lab better. 
3530	1	0	0	The experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make it was correct. 
3531	1	0	0	Clear show a good procedure on the sample and the names of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it with and how well. 
3532	1	0	0	 a final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the sample. We also need to have a control to show how the others were affected. 
3533	1	0	0	Samples after taking them out of their containers. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and vingar. Also water and containers. 
3534	1	0	0	Dependant variable as well as a dependant variable. The students should have specified what four samples to use in the experiment. After massing the samples on step 6, determine the sample difference in before and after weight. 
3535	1	0	0	So if i tried to repeat it, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Also, we would need to know, how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. 
3536	1	0	0	The groups procedure i think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and water to distill each sample with. If you use more of one sample than another, the data can be affected without this constant. Also how much of each sample was put into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. You would also need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble, limestone, acid and plastic). They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went. 
3537	1	0	0	Was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples and the volume of the containers so all four containers don't have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts. A last step should  also be included to say repeat. 
3538	1	0	0	 or simply there can be a temperature differences instead of measuring the mass. What containers should we use? 
3539	1	0	0	Vineger into 4 masses. You need to add you need to rinse the containers. Nothing b messed up in the experiment. Lastly, i need to know what kind of vinegar you need to put same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of each sample. 
3540	1	0	0	Each container i would also add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. 
3541	1	0	0	Also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do i put into the containers. We also need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the right label. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered. The starting mass of each sample. 
3542	1	0	0	Should hecking for this experiment. 
3543	1	0	0	 and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. 
3544	1	0	0	Concerning the oud example of the experiment. Then, i would need to rinse the sample. 
3545	1	0	0	The containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples. 
3546	1	0	0	Little  or too much, and the amount of samples needed (how much needed. 
3547	1	0	0	An idea how much ""one material"" is. "
3548	1	0	0	Describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if they should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry. 
3549	1	0	0	Was repeated to see that there was no errors accidentally, happened and you would need to know how big the containers were. 
3550	1	0	0	 possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, like a petri dish, to avoid contamination. 
3551	1	0	0	Put all the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to allow the samples be dry, you also would want to know how much of each sample was used. The procedure should also include  how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. What kind of container should we use? 
3552	1	0	0	All of the samples have the same amount. Lastly, i would need to the near of the 4 different samples you need to use for that procedure. 
3553	1	0	0	Types get mixed up. The students should also include other trials and also if the vinegar needs to be added to the containers with vinegar. At the end of the procedure compare them to your prediction. 
3554	1	0	0	The motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said, ""determine the mass of four different samples. 
3555	1	0	0	Its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible. 
3556	1	0	0	Rinsed with and what qualities  a sample to write down the findings. 
3557	1	0	0	To ensure equal experiment. 
3558	1	0	0	Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass because that's how your doing the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over again i would need additional information. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the containers with vinegar. With this information, it would be important to know the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble. 
3559	1	0	0	Be submersed compleatly or not. 
3560	1	0	0	Exactly they kept the samples in and how big the containers are that you need to know how long to note samples for. 
3561	1	0	0	4 samples this are testing for, what is their statement? 
3562	1	0	0	More because it was sitting longer. 
3563	1	0	0	A chart saying the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment. 
3564	1	0	0	Poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster. 
3565	1	0	0	This experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, i could only guess the materials they used for the experiment. I need to know how big each container was the holds the samples. I would need to know what the four different sample and why you would put the samples in? How big should the containers be placed it. Cold? Hot? Room temp? ^p -after 24 hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples? Do the samples stay outside or inside? Day or night? 
3566	1	0	0	They using and also how much of each sample to place in the vinegar, needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar put into each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples. 
3567	1	0	0	 i would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with water. 
3568	1	0	0	Some important details when writing their procedure. Lastly, they should have measure mass much more often as well. 
3569	1	0	0	Need to control group and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on. 
3570	1	0	0	Type of climate the containers have to be, how much vinegar was placed in the container. 
3571	1	0	0	Material to start with, and specifically which samples. Also one piece that have to be added to the procedure, then you could replicate the experiment. 
3572	1	0	0	There are important parts of the procedure that are missing. 
3573	1	0	0	They clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment. We would also have to know how big of a sample to use and how should i dry it. 
3574	1	0	0	Fipst of all the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals. 
3575	1	0	0	Information is needed is how many trials they're going to do. Also how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of four different samples, they all must be the same
3576	1	0	0	Has to be more specific. 
3577	1	0	0	 so you are capable of finding the difference between the starting and inding mass, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. They should say what 4 samples are being tested. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, it can change the mass of the samples, also measure the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each container. 
3578	1	0	0	Stated is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, one would need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment. The second thing you would need to know is how much vinegar did they use for the experiment. We would also need to know how many mls of vinegar to use and how much vinegar howa you need in order to replicate the group's experement, i would want to know how much vinegar to put into the container and what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment you would need to know how much of the a sample to put in the four containers. I would also need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size. 
3579	1	0	0	10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, the temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples, also the size of each sample. 
3580	1	0	0	Use grams or miligrams. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the samples. Say what you are experimenting and what is making that change. You also should know how long to note samples for. 
3581	1	0	0	Replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample sit and dry, because that environmental factor could change the results of the mass in all objects. 
3582	1	0	0	Without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not identify how much vinegar is being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
3583	1	0	0	Needs to be submersed compleatly or not. 
3584	1	0	0	The mass in all objects. 
3585	1	0	0	Watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around. 
3586	1	0	0	Amount used for all containers. Finally, you would need to pour in each of them vinegar to determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it. 
3587	1	0	0	You have to pour in the cups. How much vinegar, what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples. 
3588	1	0	0	Be and where to store the cups. How much vinegar, what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples. 
3589	1	0	0	It out of their processes. 
3590	1	0	0	Needs to be stated in the procedure. Lastly, they should tell you the amount of vinegar and how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other. 
3591	1	0	0	With other things to see if it changes within the 24 hours. 
3592	1	0	0	Container and how large it should be, and that you need to find the difference in the mass, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment was so i could compare results of the samples. You would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of the samples or what the samples were. 
3593	1	0	0	For the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
3594	1	0	0	Water we need to rinse the samples in the containers. Most importantly, you would need to record step 3 more clearly. 
3595	1	0	0	You put one pice of of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the folowing experiment i would need to replicate this experiment there are a few more things. For instance, you would need to know how much of the a sample to put in the containers. Lastly, i feel that i would need in order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample. In order to repeat the experiment step by step. 
3596	1	0	0	Vinegar ratio will change the mass of the samples. 
3597	1	0	0	Of time in distilled water, without knowing how much vinegar to pour in each cup. You might also want to know what the ""samples"" mentioned in step 1 are. This way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion. Also, step three in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results. 
3598	1	0	0	Easier which sample to affected more by acid. 
3599	1	0	0	Are just plain renthstig. "
3600	1	0	0	Or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of samples will i need. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample and the starting mass. Last but not the least, the students would have to add to the containers. Another  step  that should add is how much vinigar to use in each container. Youwillalso need to know where to put the sample. ^p 2) i would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, i believe that the group needs to show how much vinegar is needed to be poured into each container. The procedure needs to include weigh the samples. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the second step how much vinegar
3601	1	0	0	They did multiple trails or not. 
3602	1	0	0	Of plastic they used in the expensal, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p how much acid rain is used in the containers. Every container needs the same amount of water, which should also be in the procedure. I also would need to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens. 
3603	1	0	0	If there hypothesis was true. 
3604	1	0	0	 by knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.

3606	1	0	0	Distilled water for and water to determine the mass of four different samples"". You need limestone, wood and plastic. 
3607	1	0	0	Know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to  know how much vinegar was poured in the containers as well as how they determined the mass. 
3608	1	0	0	Should be repeated to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the mass 11.2
3609	1	0	0	Long we rinse the samples for, as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc). 
3610	1	0	0	This group did not do so. The procedure should include that type of materials are not specified. The last piece of information we would need in order to replicate the experiment you would need additional information. They provide you with all the information you need to replicate the experiment additional information i would need to know how much vinegar to place into each containers, what the hypothesis is. 
3611	1	0	0	Long or what methods were used to accomplich this. "
3612	1	0	0	Samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours and at what temperature they should sit (room temp).

3614	1	0	0	2 things about the vinegar i would need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size or different? It doesn't tell the amount of vinegar in each container. 
3615	1	0	0	This experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. For instance, you would need to know what samples you would use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about. 
3616	1	0	0	Say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is nesessary to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers. 
3617	1	0	0	Big of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? Covers? ^p initial amount for each samples. "
3618	1	0	0	Would  need  a control. They need specifics like how much vinegar was placed in the container in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples in, light/dark, warm/cold.

3622	1	0	0	Containers being used and how to determine the mass of the four samples. I also think we should know what kind of container i'll be using. Finally i think they should have added is the safety things you need, goggles, gloves etc. 
3623	1	0	0	What there needs to be how much vinegar would be poured into each container. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples you could use. 
3624	1	0	0	Information that is missing is how much is a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Lastly we would need to know how much vinegar to use, include the number of tools that are needed and how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample. 
3625	1	0	0	In each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results. Last you would need the four samples ( marble, limestone, wood acid wester. The size of the containers in step 2 also need to be told the four samples the you testing. You would also need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are saying for example, i would need to know how much distilled water. 
3626	1	0	0	Keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks, it never tells you this information, it would help if they measured the mass of the samples. Also, i would put ""after 24 hours, take samples sit and dry. 
3627	1	0	0	You could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples are. 
3628	1	0	0	Samples in steps 1 or 6.they also needed to include the name of the sample material should be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get valid results. Finally, i need to know what the samples are.

3630	1	0	0	If the information that i would need would be why they are doing the experiment, you would need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor. 
3631	1	0	0	 some additional information that i would need is how much vinegar was poured on the the subjects. Also i would need to replicate this experiment i would need a better procedure that is
3632	1	0	0	To be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as  wood or marble. I need to know the purpose. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, first was that the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the room temperature
3633	1	0	0	The grap determined the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance. The procedure should include the names of the samples themselves in the question. And there is no information is no information on finding the mass. 
3634	1	0	0	 group failed to identify how much vinegar goes into the identical contaicee. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a determined place etc. 
3635	1	0	0	What temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results. And also how much of the sample i should be using. Finally i would a need to find out what type of vinegar is used in each. 
3636	1	0	0	To be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if i get the same results. 
3637	1	0	0	The difference in weight. We need those information to know how much vinegar to put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
3638	1	0	0	May be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3639	1	0	0	Experiment be as close and as repeated as possible. 
3640	1	0	0	Is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours. I would also need what i uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain effected it. You need to state the size of the container, which is very important. Finally, i would also need to know the amount of vinegar. 
3641	1	0	0	They should tell the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment. Make sure you get all the data and make a chart. 
3642	1	0	0	Experiment they must supply more specific information for example, they should list the samples they used. How much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the temperature. 
3643	1	0	0	Have different samples than them. 
3644	1	0	0	The results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for. 
3645	1	0	0	Starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes. 
3646	1	0	0	 what the students used to obtain the mass of the four samples being massed, without this information, replicating the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups, and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we need is what kind of samples. 
3647	1	0	0	To know the problem and how much vinigar was put in to each of the four containers, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.

3649	1	0	0	Those results to the experiment are
3650	1	0	0	Why we are determinig the mass of each sample? 
3651	1	0	0	They determined the masses of the samples. 
3652	1	0	0	Need all three pieces to describe the additional information, one could now replicate the experiment. 
3653	1	0	0	 so we would be able to do the same steps over. But you need to be told how much vinegar i should use and the size of the container must be included. For step, the units being used used to be stated. 
3654	1	0	0	What i uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain effected it. You need to subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference between them. 
3655	1	0	0	Samples is over basic word and can mean anything. In step 2 i would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly i would need vinegar in each but identical containers, the second is to list the far samples in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, i would need to know is how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. 
3656	1	0	0	Would be very useful, i'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, and where did they place the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples. 
3657	1	0	0	Inside the containers could also change the results. 
3658	1	0	0	Vinegar and the size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results. Lastly, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that i am measuring the vinegar with. 
3659	1	0	0	Table of ingredients and the conclusion. 
3660	1	0	0	 the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be in each container. How long to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be added to the procedure, the group would also need to know some additional information. I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out. "
3661	1	0	0	Masses of the materials before and after. 
3662	1	0	0	Of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, what type of wood? What is the temperature. Lastly, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and i wouldn't be able to be replicated, the students failed to state how much vinegar to pour in each container. They should have also told what type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass of each sample. I would also need to know how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers as well as how they determined the mass of the container. They need to specity what the
3663	1	0	0	Expeirment in so the experiment doesn't go wrong. You would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins. It does not state what the four samples were. If they added those things in the procedure you would need to know what are the samples? How much vineger to put in each cup. 
3664	1	0	0	That you put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do i put the materials in ' what surface or what do i are the materials with, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for. 
3665	1	0	0	Went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. I would also need to know if all the four samples be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result. 
3666	1	0	0	Information we need to do the experiment wrong. Step 1 could of said record the starting mass and the ending mass and the difference in mass for each sample, and what are they drying into? 
3667	1	0	0	Up all  three masses, starting, ending and difference in all mass. To make sure there is only one independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to use in the samples, they all must be the same
3668	1	0	0	 mostly evapoltantiy i need to know the size of each ''sample''
3669	1	0	0	That you can have negative grams. 
3670	1	0	0	The four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion. In step 1 and 6, you should describe how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers why would you get another container to put them in? It was very confusing. They needed to say how much vinegar to pour into each container. 
3671	1	0	0	 container masses and how the acid rain effected it. You need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying figure out in the first place. And what to use to do it. You also need to know is how much much distilled water i am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples. Also i would put the exact steps in the procedure to record data. Write down you need to record tour data. 
3672	1	0	0	 tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know how much vinegar to use on the materials. Lastly they would need to identify what that sample. You also need to know how much vinegar you need and i need  to know the affects of vinegar on the material, the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. And you would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each and you need to know how much vinager to pour into the four containers. I don't know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, it would be important to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible. 
3673	1	0	0	 tell it in your procedure. Tell the reader how much vinegar to pour in each cup, exactly what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. You would need to know of each sample was used. Finally i would need to know is what the samples are, how much vinegar you pour in each container, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, at the end you should use the same amount of time. ^p another, make sure is the same temperature. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not. 
3674	1	0	0	Wouldn t know what you are using what the samples are, tell how much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample. For this step i would need to know what is in the cups. If says after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers. 
3675	1	0	0	Need to state exectly how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all student samples. Lastly i would need to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the mass of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. Also, it is not stated in step 6 how to determine the mass of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples. 
3676	1	0	0	To tell exactly what samples (rocks). They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator. 
3677	1	0	0	What tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.

3681	1	0	0	Last thing that should be added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the four different samples, what are the samples like what rocks they are. Also, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass, you need  additional information. The group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass. 
3682	1	0	0	Of a change in mass. 
3683	1	0	0	Variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                       2) to know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                  1) to know the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment so i could see what changed and how. I also need to know how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -the mass of the different sampes such as what would i use to determine how much of each sample and what kind. You would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass afther every sample loss mass expect for wood. I had the same mass at the start. 
3684	1	0	0	That were missing would be the amount of vinegar added to each container, also you would need to know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                    1) to know the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. 
3685	1	0	0	Said what the samples were. Another thing i would need to know is what types of container i should use. 
3686	1	0	0	The experiment for all trials and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that when replicated the same samples will be used. 
3687	1	0	0	 allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of samples they are, how much acid rain is used in the containers. Also the amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be a lot more accurate. 
3688	1	0	0	Containers to do the experiment, i would first need to know how much vinegar they used, what sae was the container that held the vinegar, it has to be in each container. They need to have every piece of information in order to replicate the experiment. 
3689	1	0	0	They do not mention the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment, also the temperature the writer would be, how much of the solution was poored. They also need to include the ammount of vinegar in each sample, and make sure its the same type of samples they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. Also they should have a step for recording their data. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the results are acurate. They would need to tell me what type of container i'm to store the samples for the 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water, more trials could be done for accuracy. 
3690	1	0	0	Sit an dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should repeat the experiment more than once to make it was correct. 
3691	1	0	0	The exact mass of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar to put in each container. The students should've added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be difficult to replicate the experiment. 
3692	1	0	0	Them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence. 
3693	1	0	0	 the group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is the starting mass. Lastly i need distilled water for the sample's and i would need to replicate the experiment, you would need to record every different mass on the data table which was done after the experiment. 
3694	1	0	0	In which to measure the rocks mass and vinegar. They would also have to know what type of sample am i weighing. I need to know on what i should place the containers too, for example, how much water you have to rinse the samples with. You would also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should sit (room temp). 
3695	1	0	0	24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes. 
3696	1	0	0	Experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each determined? 
3697	1	0	0	Do the or what ri they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment. 
3698	1	0	0	Well as needing to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry? 
3699	1	0	0	Solution were in and the amount of time the samples were in the procedure and i would need to also know which type of container to put the samples in. This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important to know the amount of vinegar could impact the mass. The temperature of vineger, how long should we nase  the samples for. 
3700	1	0	0	Equal amount of each samples. We must know how much of the material was used, how much sample to put in each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they are. Also it is necessary to comprare all the answers with one another by subtracting and seeing each others differences, and 8. Depend exparament al least three times to make sure the answers they come out with, were alright. 
3701	1	0	0	Use co i need a graph of some sat to record the starting mass, ending mass, difference - 0.4.
3702	1	0	0	Whatever or not to make a data table. 
3703	1	0	0	And how to find the mass. 
3704	1	0	0	 also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should put in the containers. 
3705	1	0	0	 inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. 
3706	1	0	0	Step which should state that they should run atleast 3 trials so that their information could be accurate. 
3707	1	0	0	The experiment i would need an additional information. I would follow the procedure step by step. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what the mass is when you take the sample out of the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. Also you need lables to identify each sonified container. The amount of vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would also need to know the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples to dry for an half an hour. 
3708	1	0	0	Students also forgot to include whether or not if they need to stay at room temp, in a seperat cup or container? 
3709	1	0	0	Cups to put the samples in so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table. 
3710	1	0	0	The vinegar or water, you  would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar i needed to pour into the containers. 
3711	1	0	0	Have to know more information. I would also need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, the procedure says to pour vinegar in each of the containers. 
3712	1	0	0	Sunny warm place or dark cold place. What kind of surroundings and environment? 
3713	1	0	0	Room temperature and to make sure the results are valid. 
3714	1	0	0	Procedures i nade need to what to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should also say how to find the mass, how much vinegar should be added. For example, the marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much of the sample material. Also, how much vinegar  you add, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar to put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature. 
3715	1	0	0	Determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials. 
3716	1	0	0	Difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings. 
3717	1	0	0	Fast different samples that are being tested. Another piece of information would be a bar graph then i would give specific directions on what i did. But i would want to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, additional information that would need to be identified as ""samples of. .."". They should have explained in their procedure to calculate the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass. 
3718	1	0	0	The vinegar needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the materials, what kind of vinegar to use, how much time you will need to know what the ""samples"" mentioned in step 1 are. This way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion. Also, you would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer. 
3719	1	0	0	Was used in the containers. 
3720	1	0	0	Is how they should explain their experiment. All these need are the true basic's. 
3721	1	0	0	And dependent variable more fluent so that way, in case they mess up, they can record the room temperature to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. Since i am unaware of how to determine the mass of four defferent samples. Pour vinegar in each of the four containers so we know how much to put in each container, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, how do we determine the mass of all four or any samples. 
3722	1	0	0	If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the experiment. Also you would need four new samples. And determine the mass of the material, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, such as a test tube or a different type of container. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to use. 
3723	1	0	0	Need the the for sample rocks, vinegar but what we don't know is how much vingar should i poor into the the four identical containers, and to allow the samples to sit when they are. 
3724	1	0	0	Vinegar to add because they don't say this in the procedure. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, how big each container was. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the samples for. 
3725	1	0	0	Tell and see each one is different in mass. 
3726	1	0	0	Know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they corrolate and that this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic. 2) pour 10ml (how much) of vinegar in each sample, find the size and shape of all samples, and where did they place the samples in the procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind and it's size. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as water to compare the results. 
3727	1	0	0	Leaving the samples sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you will need to also include what type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment. 
3728	1	0	0	To say how much vinegar they used, because that should be the same. Wood had highest starting and ending mass and the time. Also, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the out come of the samples. You would also need to know what the four samples were even though it is stated in the data table, i wouldn't have known what their samples were. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup. The amount of vinegar they used ^p                        2) to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. You would also have to include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something
3729	1	0	0	They are and how long you rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water. 
3730	1	0	0	Order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. A scale to weight the mass of four different samples that are being tested. The final thing would be that we might need to know the materials the students are using. And i would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer. 
3731	1	0	0	Is replicated this experiment is how long should you rinse it. 
3732	1	0	0	Have to dry in a cool area? What type of container to use and whether to react the samples or not. 
3733	1	0	0	Vinegar was in use for this experiment. I would need to know how large each material is. This way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion. Also, i would need to know how much vinegar is being poured in the container. Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass you end up with, and the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, limestone, wood, and plastic to do this you would also need to know how much vinegar is used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water. 
3734	1	0	0	Using to find the mass by a triple beam balance. 
3735	1	0	0	Them on a paper towel, and tell the size of each material. And how do you determin the mass? 
3736	1	0	0	Of four seperate but identical containers. ^p place one sample in a conteiner and do the same thing. The seconds to saw vinegar to pour into each container. We also need to know how much vingar is need and what is the problem they are trying to do. Lastly, i need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed. 
3737	1	0	0	And what temperature was the water. 
3738	1	0	0	Actually only says place a sample of one material into one container and label. What sample? What material? What containers and what are the four identical containers. Place the materials into the containers and we would also need to know firstand what my samples are; i don't want to look for them in the results. 
3739	1	0	0	Temp that they would have the containers in. One might also want to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information i could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa. 
3740	1	0	0	They stored the containers for 24 hours, and not the amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be inaccurate. In addition, i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. They would also need to know what i am labeling on containers, and what das i use to remove samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water for 3 minutes. 5) allow the samples to sit and dry. Dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth. 
3741	1	0	0	Also include if the samples should be. The way i know, what materials were used. 
3742	1	0	0	Need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples (what instrument to use). 
3743	1	0	0	 what kinds of mass, should be added in each container. Where do the samples go to sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for 30 minutes. 
3744	1	0	0	In water after 24 hours process. 
3745	1	0	0	Seperate but identical containers. I need to know the temperature of the vinegar. This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can change the difference in mass at the end of the procedure, the additional information i would need is how the grap determined the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. To make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know is, what do the difference in the mass at the end of the procedure, the group should also  used more than one trial for each sample
3746	1	0	0	As if the lab is valid. 
3747	1	0	0	Atop and if they all are the same or different. 
3748	1	0	0	Results of the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass. 
3749	1	0	0	Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment. 
3750	1	0	0	That along with the procedure. Finally, at the end of the mass 11.2
3751	1	0	0	In it enough to cover it or not. The
3752	1	0	0	Is there names of stones. Another would be how many m/s of vinegar would i pour into the beakers. ^p 3. You need to know whether it should be in a certain temperature (room temp, high temp, or low temp. Etc). 
3753	1	0	0	The contain in step 2. Another piece of additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
3754	1	0	0	Groups procedure is that the group should have told the reader that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Much more information is needed. For step three, i would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p you need to put in each container. 
3755	1	0	0	I would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab. And i would need to know the problem and what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials. 
3756	1	0	0	Be helpful to tell us what kind of container should we use? , what should we use to determine mass before and after. 
3757	1	0	0	Included was how they are going to use and if its all different shapes. Also tell if the contaners are the same size or not? 
3758	1	0	0	Let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry). 
3759	1	0	0	Container and what shape the samples were in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the samples. 
3760	1	0	0	 what to weigh the objects that i am testing second i ^p would need to know the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials are not specified. 
3761	1	0	0	And need to include that in the beginning. But it did not have any mention to it. 
3762	1	0	0	Four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also i would need each of the subjects to have the same area, it does not explicate. 
3763	1	0	0	Present in making sure they are all the same. The materials would have to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions. 
3764	1	0	0	Get the same amount of vinegar on each sample and let it sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, a mass would need to be the same masses. Also the starting weight of the samples. 
3765	1	0	0	An effect on the results. 
3766	1	0	0	Why this observation was being done. 
3767	1	0	0	The same mass at the beginning of the experiment. Give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do  varies  and should the all same time and what temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many rocks should be placed in the containers. And lastly, how much vinegar was poured into the separate four identical containers, they also need amount of time in distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry. 
3768	1	0	0	The experiment i belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, and the could have explained how to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). This could mess up the experiment if you are not told this. 
3769	1	0	0	Also mentioned weighing the rocks, the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know to record the data. 
3770	1	0	0	 then you wouldn t know what you are using to measure the mass of the four different samples. What do you use to rinse each object and how long do i rinse for, and how long to rinse it in water (materials). And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period. 
3771	1	0	0	Scale and a type of vinegar. What type of plastic because their are so many different types. ^p -you would need to know. 
3772	1	0	0	Like to have known why were they doing this experiment. The first is how much vinegar did they use in each container. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. Also what to measure them with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles. 
3773	1	0	0	Be opened or closed during the twenty-four hour period. 
3774	1	0	0	Of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, i believe that i would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar that was placed in the containers containing the vinagar. 
3775	1	0	0	This experiment would would be amount of vinegar, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p 2) how much vinegar should be poured into each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. You would also have to know how i would rinse each samples with distilled water. For long should the sample be in question 3, and how much water to rinse them in (step 4). 
3776	1	0	0	Are and if each sample should be named in the procedure like ""determine the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, at how big should containers be. 
3777	1	0	0	In the when you pilled it out. 
3778	1	0	0	This experiment is how much vinegar i should put into each container. 
3779	1	0	0	Would need to most importantly state what the experiment is about. 
3780	1	0	0	Lastly to repeat this expirement i would need to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar was put into each container. Second of all we should also know how long we rinse of each sample with d water. The third thing we would have to know much vinegar i am pouring into each container. They must should be specific. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, tell what they are taking samples of. Another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to put in the containers. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to each vinegar sample. 
3781	1	0	0	Off you need to know what materials to get. They would need to add in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing. I thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to put in the cups? 
3782	1	0	0	Used c for example white, apple material. Also, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell how much of each sample to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would need to replicate the experiment i would need to know is the temperature at which the samples were kept. I would also need to show how you got your results and conclusion. 
3783	1	0	0	It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material. Finally you wood need to no what materials they used as samples. Second, you need to make a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed. 
3784	1	0	0	If the materials are listed, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, i need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the open or the outside. 
3785	1	0	0	Would have to say what type and what size container to put the sample in and how many times would be needed to repeat the experiment, you would need to know what volume of vinegar to use and what type of vinegar is being used. They should start out at roughly the same mass as well. Also, i may need to know what the samples are in the procedure. Find the average of the samples. 
3786	1	0	0	We using to determine the mass of the samples be the same. 
3787	1	0	0	They are the samples being used, how big should they be. Another thing that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is to include what to label the container. I would need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big are they? 
3788	1	0	0	Or they can be sorted in distilled h2o. 
3789	1	0	0	Of everything and the numbers that go with it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to them. 
3790	1	0	0	Been stated at the beginning with at knowing knowing what the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, how big of a sample to test in the experiment. 
3791	1	0	0	Analize the data or anything like that. 
3792	1	0	0	They would rock for the temperature of the vinegar. 
3793	1	0	0	Materials with which was grams. 
3794	1	0	0	Should include that type of materials are used. If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials. Also the amount of vinegar and it is hard to replicate the experiment i would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. 
3795	1	0	0	What youcan know what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing. 
3796	1	0	0	Could have told how much vinegar, the acual size of the container and how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what they used to make the distilled water, without knowing how long to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hours. Lastly, you need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)it's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)we need to know more about the containers, also be more clear about the control in the experiment to make sure the answers they come out with, were alright. 
3797	1	0	0	You would determine the mass of all four or any samples. 
3798	1	0	0	How large the material was. Also, to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container. 
3799	1	0	0	Seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, i'd need to know what the samples were of, how much water should be used to take out the sample from the container. 
3800	1	0	0	Into each containers would need to be a after temperature, and how long i need to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to replicate the experiment is, the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers were used. 
3801	1	0	0	Outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out. "
3802	1	0	0	 there was and mention of the samples being tested. Another piece of information that i would need would be to put more time. A sample to be the most efficient. 
3803	1	0	0	For this lab to be repeated
3804	1	0	0	What exactly was i trying to find out). 
3805	1	0	0	Samples to put something over the containers, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass was. 
3806	1	0	0	Or in the heat. 
3807	1	0	0	Lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments. 
3808	1	0	0	They simply tell us to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. If we don, t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also in order to replicate the experiment, the procedure must also state how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each sample. Finally, you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into containers, the location where the containers were placed, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for the materials all arent the same. 
3809	1	0	0	Dry or did they leave it on the table. 
3810	1	0	0	Vinegar that you pour into the cups. If we do not know how much of each material. So the all came out equal. You would also need to know how bigof a container. 
3811	1	0	0	Much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples. 
3812	1	0	0	And they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure. You would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting. We would also need to know how much vinegar is poored in the containers. And what does distilled water mean. 
3813	1	0	0	Samples were chosen and if there should be more details like, what kind of samples we are going to do the experiment. 
3814	1	0	0	How much should you have in each container? Also i would also need to know what the different samples were listed in the procedure, they need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the cup. However, you are never told what the samples are. I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar used, all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity. 
3815	1	0	0	Information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar do i use. 
3816	1	0	0	Information you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temperature or anywhere else. 
3817	1	0	0	Way of massing the sample should be placed in the container, which is the starting mass of each material was used because it doesn't say how much vinegar rate into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to calculate the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass. 
3818	1	0	0	People read if they might not know how much vinegar to put in the container. I also need to know what kind of scale. They should also put so the procedure, there is not enough information for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar they used, the types of containers that were used. Also, they do not mention how much the samples are, tell how much vinegar to pour into the containers. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ. 
3819	1	0	0	Because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat. Another one is to list out the materials, all the steps that they did. 3. I would also need to know how to measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. What conditions would the material be soaking in (temp, light ext-- )
3820	1	0	0	Or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, i believe the containers should be and how to get it. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment, i would need to also know which type of vinegar was used. 
3821	1	0	0	Needed to add that information in order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know what the conditions are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples. 
3822	1	0	0	Be to identify how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four separate containers. Also they need to tell you how to do the graph. 
3823	1	0	0	Better replicate this expiriment, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested including independent and dependent variade. 
3824	1	0	0	Was pored into each container, and i also need to know what the purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for 60minsand
3825	1	0	0	Need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could have said, ""determine the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be used. "
3826	1	0	0	Of distilled water used to rinse the materials. 2) tell how much distilled water to rinse the samples under distilled water for. 
3827	1	0	0	Cups have to be? 
3828	1	0	0	Its all different shapes. Also tell if the contaners are the same size or not? 
3829	1	0	0	To know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers. 
3830	1	0	0	We should put in the procedure the names of materials we are using. 
3831	1	0	0	Out come of the samples. How much of each sample  there  was. Also, to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed. Also what type of containers to put the samples on to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass you end up with, and the difference in the objects that were placed in the water. 
3832	1	0	0	Nice to have some ideas. They should also tell of the meathod they are using to determine the mass. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, i would need to know, how to determine the beginning mass. Step two needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hour period. ^p lastly, you would have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. The third would be by what method should the mass of the sample. 
3833	1	0	0	To use them later on in the experiment. We also need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, you need to know the much vinegar to use. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled water. 
3834	1	0	0	Is to add more detail to the first step by agknowledging what samples we have to determine the mass of  four different samples. For the next step, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. One additional information they could have added is mass, the ending mass and the time. So they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the mass of them. 
3835	1	0	0	Information to make it accurate. First of all, we would need to know how much of each sample you are puting in the cup. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. In step two they should say how much vinegar should be poured into each of the containers. And what kind of samples and simpler steps. 
3836	1	0	0	Material placed in the vinegar are also left out. The names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They needed to included in their procedure, the samples of the experiment and wich sample. ^p                              1) to know the amount of vinegar can change the exeperiment. 
3837	1	0	0	And dry for different time. ^p another suggestion let it sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting too much or too little vinegar will change the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they didn't state how much vinegar was put into each sample. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they should say the names of it. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, i would needed to know the different types of material so i knew i am testing. The procedure should explain what type of samples your using, i tell you how to set up the cups, one might receive not only different but in accurate data. 
3838	1	0	0	Volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same size. 
3839	1	0	0	Place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment is 1) to gather all the materials. It would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say how much vinegar they poured into each container. The procedure also does not tell us what to measure with, they also should put how much of the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, i never knew that you can have negative grams. 
3840	1	0	0	With with what would you be using to determine the mass of the containers because if one sample is bigger than another, it might change the weight and how much water do you use to measure the samples and what was used to weigh the samples with. 
3841	1	0	0	Could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, they need to say at what temperature they should be left in the light or the dark. 
3842	1	0	0	Should be to collect all the samples. 
3843	1	0	0	Sample so the vinegar can wash off. 
3844	1	0	0	Need a bottle of vinegar, a container cabels, temer, paper, a manole, a cemenstone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. In addition, one would need to know how much vinigar to put into the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the cups and how much of the sample. 
3845	1	0	0	Scale used was electric or normal. 
3846	1	0	0	Into the container for each sample. The final piece of information should be that, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes. 
3847	1	0	0	Are essential to replicating this experiment. 
3848	1	0	0	This experiment they must supply more specific information for example, they should list the samples they used. For example, how much of one sample material do they want, and how much or how long to rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment. 
3849	1	0	0	 for example the amount of vinegar put in to each of the four, separate, but identical containers. Finally it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry on a substance. 
3850	1	0	0	How to set up the cups, also how much water you should rinse each sample. "
3851	1	0	0	Make sure that when i'm going to end the mass, i will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass. 
3852	1	0	0	Or a test tube. 
3853	1	0	0	Order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, i would want to place the containers and then where to place the containers after they have been rinsed' do you place them in a cold area, hot area or room temperature. This could effect the mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, i would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer. 
3854	1	0	0	Mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples. How much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as? How much vinegar do i put into the containers? You would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another. 
3855	1	0	0	One more trial material before reply 2conclusion. The recommended sizes of the samples should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar is independent variable. I would also need to know how much water or how long to rinse of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even performing this experiment. 
3856	1	0	0	All the containers contained an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
3857	1	0	0	The trial more than once to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container. Also, i would need to put into each container. The amount of sample poured in each containers, tell what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar to put into the cups, one might receive not only different but in accurate data. 
3858	1	0	0	To say which samples to use. Another thing we would need to know to replicate the experiment, i would know how much of each are you would need. I would do the experiment the same way so i would also need to know what types of samples are being placed in the vinegar are also left out. The names of the four different samples. Replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically. After 24 hours, remove the samples frim the containers. Finally i would need to determine the mass, you would also need to know that we need to find the difference of the beginning and end of the experiment. Also you would need to replicate the experiment would be how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how do we move the samples without touching
3859	1	0	0	And probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment on my own, the group should use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should have said their control. ^p this will give you data to base your exams findings onto. 
3860	1	0	0	For the wood sample you would need to know the kind of word used. You would also want to know what materials to use. You would also need the amount trials done. 
3861	1	0	0	To add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. 
3862	1	0	0	You might need to replicate this experiment you would have to know more information. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers. We would also need to know in what condition i should plac the container in. It is neccessary to know how the group is covering the samples from the container and rinse each sample with water. After that i will have to place the four samples in step one. 
3863	1	0	0	We put them in the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the samples had to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar. 
3864	1	0	0	The investigation is good or bad. 
3865	1	0	0	To be testing instead of saying samples. Another thing the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Second, you will need top know how much vinegar i should put into each container. You should know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you don't know. 
3866	1	0	0	If the sample much be a certain size
3867	1	0	0	Each sampe in order to replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph. 
3868	1	0	0	Where the containers should be. The last thing is that, 
3869	1	0	0	Be added to be able to replicate this experiment, the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. 
3870	1	0	0	Would go in the first step. The procedure needs to be more clear. There should be a control included within the experiment. In steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. Also the type of container i should i put the cups in, in the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results. 
3871	1	0	0	Is the fact that the difference in mass. 
3872	1	0	0	Differently we could get different results. You'd also need to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours. 
3873	1	0	0	 it would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the results. Lastly, to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p how much vinegar would be put in to each container, in step 2 they do not say the size of the container they're using. Finally in order to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did. 3. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use for one
3874	1	0	0	Total masses lossed to complete the experiment you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain was need to effect the mass. 
3875	1	0	0	To know whatknd of samples to use what kind of containers you should use. 
3876	1	0	0	How long the samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently. 
3877	1	0	0	Why they are testing viniger. Also they should add.5)record data, they should include what type of sample i would need to know, how they re going to determine the mass of each sample hey. 
3878	1	0	0	How you determined the mass of the sample, do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also because it doesn't say in the procedure to record the starting mass of each of the samples after they are removed from vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into each of the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can affect the results. The procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four separate containers. Put a sample of a material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples. 
3879	1	0	0	Be writen more clearly it would be hard to do this lab. Also the size of the containers so all four containers don't have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts. A last piece of info. Would be what temperature to keep the experiment a constant. Also, the procedure would need to be indicated in the procedure. You would also need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I would tell you the outcome on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment went through. 
3880	1	0	0	You to record your data. 
3881	1	0	0	 weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the main things you need to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students how poured into the containers, need a scale and a type of vinegar. 
3882	1	0	0	Leave the samples to sit and dry. The additional information i would need is to know the amount of each sample used so that i could compare my results in it. They also included only the trial. "
3883	1	0	0	 also other info would be, determine the mass of each sample. 
3884	1	0	0	 that makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, i would need to know how much distilled water to use and how long to rinse each container with distilled water. Also in order to replicate this experiment, i'll need more information. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. "
3885	1	0	0	Min what happens after you determine the mass of each sample. 
3886	1	0	0	Place each cup during the experiment and to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials. 
3887	1	0	0	Cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, because whether vinegar may us more acidic. 
3888	1	0	0	Been stated in order for the experiment to work. And we would need to know how to dry the samples would they need to be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly i would make a control, i would also need to know exactly what it is were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. In addition, one would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to know what to put the samples in. You need to know what type of container can be used for the repeated trials. 
3889	1	0	0	Reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information would be the location where the containers were started and the instrument used to prepare the mass of samples, either a laple temprereture digital scales. 
3890	1	0	0	Different containers and what should they have worked on to make better. 
3891	1	0	0	Is a size limit. Most of all, they did not table the four identical containers, the amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, we would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each sample. 
3892	1	0	0	Of scale it could change your results. 
3893	1	0	0	Sample with a paper towel or cloth. 
3894	1	0	0	Sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and we would also need to know how long the samples should be put, rather light or dark, because this effects the outcome. 
3895	1	0	0	Vinegar they use in each container. A good procedure would have specified this
3896	1	0	0	 the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the containers they were put in. 
3897	1	0	0	Before putting the data down. 
3898	1	0	0	Same mass for all samples, and how to measure the mass of the samples. In order to be able to duplicate this experiment i would need to have samples with the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar on all four. After you have these materials you need to weigh the samples. Also, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be in the same exact conditions. 
3899	1	0	0	Of information they should have added record the data, by telling us how many cups of vinergen is needed. 
3900	1	0	0	 the sample and how they are going to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The also need to say how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the marble went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."
3901	1	0	0	The envoment would be very useful, i'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, the vinegar on. They need something that won't change. They also didn't list all the materials they used were marble, limestone, wood acid wester. The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment. 
3902	1	0	0	Dark or if sunlight touched the rocks during the experiment. 
3903	1	0	0	In the identical containers, and which materials. We would also need to know how much acidity is in the water. 
3904	1	0	0	The time the materials are soaked in the vinegar. The amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. 
3905	1	0	0	Would have given a measurement of how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, you would need distilled water. 
3906	1	0	0	Information i would add would be to determine how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how much vinegar was used in their experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, the mass of each sample, and i would repeat the lab again to see if i get the same answers. 
3907	1	0	0	Sit each for 24 hours. What would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are. 
3908	1	0	0	Marbles of any kind. Also, for the wood sample you would need to get the average that was used in each cup. Another piece of information i would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, we need to know how much vinegar to use on each material. And how much of the sample we need. 
3909	1	0	0	Might each erato faster. Also you wood need to no how big is the container is. 
3910	1	0	0	Would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all student samples. Lastly, they didn't say how much viniger they put in the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
3911	1	0	0	Change the time usage to see if there project was right and they also should have wrote what the experament was about. 
3912	1	0	0	Know to do it because the procedure did not tell us what the four materials are, so it would have a different answer. 
3913	1	0	0	The measurements of liquid to pour in each container is also not stated. These are the three things that i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers with the materials. 
3914	1	0	0	Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions. 
3915	1	0	0	Would have to mass out each individual container in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar. 
3916	1	0	0	Say we got all four samples then heated them. Another piece of information that they did not add was to re-label the samples after they dried. Without this information, replicating the experiment would be how much vinegar would be put in to each container? 
3917	1	0	0	You can do it over again to see if i get the same answers. 
3918	1	0	0	Procedure needs a control for each sample material. And the last could be if there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you to find the difference in mass. For example, might alter the results). 
3919	1	0	0	Many as possible to get the most accurate answer. 
3920	1	0	0	On each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure should include something about recording the starting mass, and the difference in mass for each sample, it should be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours, i remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water or how much water should we use and how long should the sambes be rinsed with distilled water? Those are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they do not mention how much the samples are, if you have a lot of vinegar, and the size of the samples. ^p -observe the data and make a conclusion to the problem. 
3921	1	0	0	Be getting added to the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig. "
3922	1	0	0	The same or not and think you would need to know more information such as, the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment. Give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do  varies  and should the all same time and what temperature was the water. 
3923	1	0	0	To list the materials you were using. 
3924	1	0	0	Samples should be covered or not. Also what am i supposed to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. Or my results may vary. 
3925	1	0	0	Of the vinegar is tuching it. 
3926	1	0	0	Repeat the lab for accuracy. 
3927	1	0	0	An accurate measurement of the distilled water. 
3928	1	0	0	See if it effected the ending mass. 
3929	1	0	0	If they used the same size cup. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things. 
3930	1	0	0	Should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in each cup, what sample material would be, what type of samples they used. A person would be able to replicate the experiment you need
3931	1	0	0	Going into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also like to know how much water to use when you rinse each sample in distiled water. 
3932	1	0	0	Where i should place a sample. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles. 
3933	1	0	0	Which they would have to record their data. Finally, to improve these students labs i think the should expain the list of materials they were using and its size. 
3934	1	0	0	Vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar. 
3935	1	0	0	Should be the sample or letters like a, b, c, d. 
3936	1	0	0	Of any of the materials? How much of one material is considered to be a sample. Lastly, saying how you determine the mass of the samples. It is possible heat and light may alter the results. Lastly, you should also need to tell you to find the starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals. 
3937	1	0	0	Experiment in all exactness. Otherwise, the data the group of students. 
3938	1	0	0	Results that the groups of students. 
3939	1	0	0	How their experiment went. So they are all equall. What type of samples they used and would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting and ending mass. Then you would have to form a hypothesis. Also when samples are ready to sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers? ^p for step three what do you label them with. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the mass of the different samples, mass of the sample before and after the experiment. 
3940	1	0	0	 this could also effect the outcome of the experiment. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable, dependant variable, control and you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to have more than one teal for each of the containers. We would also need to know the name of the sample material. And the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference in mass. 
3941	1	0	0	 and that the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way i know, what materials were used, the types of samples. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, we need to know the density of each sample and where the samples should be. The last piece of information you would need in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to use. 
3942	1	0	0	Wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be added to the procedure. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why they are performing the experiment. These are important to being able to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment you would have to make these change. 
3943	1	0	0	Had the procedure and not the table, you would need to know how much vinegar. Also repeat twice. 
3944	1	0	0	Samples out in containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing the samples into containers, however it is not clear from the procedure what the four different samples. Replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. 
3945	1	0	0	Lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of each sample that you need. ^p. Purpose of the experiment. 
3946	1	0	0	Has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight. 
3947	1	0	0	Under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy i need to know how long the samples need to be at, also if they are covered or uncovered. Finally, you would need  have valid data, a control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults. 
3948	1	0	0	Will need more mass and you have to mass it after the whole expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p -what type of container should the sample be rinsed? "
3949	1	0	0	How the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. I will also need to know where to put the label on the material itself, on the cup, or on a table, etc. Finally, you should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the same for the samples in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples. ^p 2) how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. I would also need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, how do we determine the mass of four samples of what? They never say how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Lastly
3950	1	0	0	And ending mass were were the same 11.2
3951	1	0	0	Should state  the conditions the sample would be in, for example the temp. Of the room, and the amount of the sample that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) what are they trying to get the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger. 
3952	1	0	0	Them sit for 30 minutes, or just to let it sit for 24 hours. 
3953	1	0	0	One must know information that is not given by the procedure. They also need to include how much vinegar to pour in each cup. Place the materials into the containers and where you should let the samples dry in. 
3954	1	0	0	Of containers to use and how to measure the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container. 
3955	1	0	0	Is to include what to label the containers. Another thing you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance. 
3956	1	0	0	And whether to react the samples or not. 
3957	1	0	0	It would have  been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Since there as the of materials
3958	1	0	0	A cup and why are they doing this experiment? ^p why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p and for me to replicate this experiment you will need the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you organize yourself, you then determine the mass you end up with, and the difference in mass. 
3959	1	0	0	Students should say what the sample's were that they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. Finally, they should state how much vinegar to put on each sample. Without these three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to dry. 
3960	1	0	0	Tenth or hundreth of the gram. 
3961	1	0	0	This lab you would need the following information, what  the 4 samples  are, how much big are the containers, a description of the container, the more densely packed the samples are. 
3962	1	0	0	In each of for separate, but different containers. 
3963	1	0	0	The vinegar needs to be poured into the containers, where do they go for 24 hours? 
3964	1	0	0	Materials they are testing, how to write down the findings. 
3965	1	0	0	And if they all are the same or not and think you would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers. I need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in, grams, etc. If i had those three pieces of info, i would need to know what the mass is. These are the three things i would need to use the group's procedure. We would also need to know how much vinegar was used. The other don't have much difference. The stranger samples in the acid rain is wood because didn't lost a gram. 
3966	1	0	0	They should have it in the procedure. I would also need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials. 
3967	1	0	0	Material thats a major part of the experiment. 
3968	1	0	0	Can determine the mass. Since i am unaware of how to determine the samples name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At the beginning you need to determine the mass which would go in the first step that the starting mass for each sample if it's the same for all four materials. 
3969	1	0	0	Procedures out in an actually experiments. 
3970	1	0	0	The container was left in when it was left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you need to say how to remove the samples and place them into containers. I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. Lastly, the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational. 
3971	1	0	0	Would be good to now is, why are they trying to find out and, day. 
3972	1	0	0	Dependent and independent variables so i can tell and see each one is different in mass. 
3973	1	0	0	Is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you would need a scale, to know the amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the effect on vinegar. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment gets it done correctly. "
3974	1	0	0	Does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know what size or shape of container to use in the procedure. Also, the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement item i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much to pour. Also, they forget to tell you to find the difference in the mass at the end. 
3975	1	0	0	The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is very important. Finally, we need to know what types of samples to use. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. In step two, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. Which is a centered post or any experiment. They should do more than just one try with each sample, the procedure says to pour vinegar in four indentical containers but it didn't tell how much to pour in. I would also need to know how much vinegar is placed into each cup and we would need to know how hard to shake it. (different
3976	1	0	0	To use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! Ways. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel. 
3977	1	0	0	First to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers. 
3978	1	0	0	Scientist what type of container and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (having a large range and an equal amount of vinegar. The staring mass and the ending time for the experiment. And then allow the samples to sit and dry on a substance. 
3979	1	0	0	Information that you will need is what's the sizes of each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. The amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. You would need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, and what was used to measure mass. I would also need to know how they determined the mass and how they got the answer of what they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples, and how much vinegar do we put in the container. 
3980	1	0	0	 to know how much vinegar. I need to know. 
3981	1	0	0	 the students  should have included the type and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results. Lastly, they should include the size of the identical containers. Then you would have to make these change. 
3982	1	0	0	A concentrated environment? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment. 
3983	1	0	0	Items needed and how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all three can have the same temperature. Also, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar needed, the amount of vinegar poured into the samples. 
3984	1	0	0	Experiment have the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples. 
3985	1	0	0	Is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass. 
3986	1	0	0	The amount of vinagar poured on each sample. 
3987	1	0	0	 especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone, wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the amount of vinegar to put in each container to replicate this experiment, you would want to know is what type of container to use in the procedure. I would also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would need to replicate the experment is the mass of each sample. 
3988	1	0	0	Samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample you need to place in the container. 
3989	1	0	0	What you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how much of each sample there should be, and if it is the same amount for each sample. Where do you let the samples sit and dry them. You would need to know the size or the container used and what type of vinegar. 
3990	1	0	0	Know the portions of what they used as their control. ^p this will give you just the mass of the samples. 
3991	1	0	0	Would those 4 materials be. It should also tell you to do repeated trials. 
3992	1	0	0	Much vinegar to go in each container. You need to know what size container you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the masses are the same. One more additional piece of information you need to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed. And if there's anything that i shouldn't use in this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would be  necessary to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to know what four different samples i am getting, and how long to rinse the sample. 
3993	1	0	0	Samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature. They should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same for all of them. 
3994	1	0	0	Your results and make a conclusion on the experiment. 
3995	1	0	0	More distilled water having them sit for 24 hours. Lastly, you would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an object or sample you need. After adding these procedures, a person would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers. I would also need time limit to do the test. 
3996	1	0	0	And whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This will make the procedure easier to follow. 
3997	1	0	0	 how to get the mass of the experiment. 
3998	1	0	0	Much vinegar was put in each container. It should tell you to record your data and find the difference in mass. 
3999	1	0	0	Sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. Finally, the procedure would have to state that you need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers, it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate. You would also need to know how much vinegar to use and also what to label the containers.
