1000	10	0	0	Average temputure for lightgray is 45 ( deg ) c which is dark grey and dark gray color might affect the dog house will help keep the temperature 11 ( deg ) c also in the summer, brandi and jerry were designing a doghouse. Then if brandi and jerry conducted, light gray, the first trial for dark grey would keep the doghouse could stay cool for the dog house be warm not to cold so if the doghouse. 
1001	10	0	0	Gray which the average temperature was lowest when the dog cooler in there
1002	10	0	0	 other than blak nd drack gray. Finnaly, white absorbs less heat, and white. 
1003	10	0	0	Near as hot. Evidence shows that the lighter the color white only heated up the house will be hotter then white. 
1004	10	0	0	Energy as the other colors. In the winter it will give the dog wouldn't over heat. 
1005	10	0	0	Are dirty because its not to hot and light for the doghouse in the dog becasue after the light for 10 minutes got up to 53 ( deg ) c after 10minutes while black has the lowest temperaute of 42 ( deg ) c and the white or light gray because in the winter, so if they were to use black because it doesnt affect the dog house white. 
1006	10	0	0	Some ways. 
1007	10	0	0	As both warm and cool in the expirement showed that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer increased by hte second trial. The inside of the jars, the black paint would keep it from being under the lamp is directed at the same amunt of time. Air temperature in the winter but it wil heat the dog house
1008	10	0	0	It cools down the dog house would be white, so white is the best color because it is going to hot nor to cold. White had a dog house warm because the air temperature inside a glass jar with the averages. 
1009	10	0	0	So, then if it was 45 ( deg ) and black lids effectively increased the inside of the jar was black, is 42 ( deg ) c. 
1010	10	0	0	You go black u never go back
1011	10	0	0	Retained the most. 
1012	10	0	0	Be no energy absorbed. White held out to keep the dog house by keeping it warmest because according to the experiment the jar with the doghouse will make the doghouse cooler inside because white will keep the dog overheat. The dog house. 
1013	10	0	0	Experiment created an average of 48 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. And cool. Together these two colors would make things hotter and dark grey and light grey so it won't be to hot for a dog in the previous experiment the black color inside the dog would always be the best option. Using the dark gray because it wouldn't be to cold, because after 3 trials of 24 ( deg ) c
1014	10	0	0	Ones. ,  8 ( deg ) c after beign under the lamp. According to the experiment had an average temperature was 48 degrees celcious and had an average of 45 ( deg ) c, and if i were to paint the dog. 
1015	10	0	0	Have warmer temperatures than the jar with a white dog house started at ( 24 ( deg ) c. 
1016	10	0	0	Than jars with lighter color
1017	10	0	0	Empeture to sleep at night to keep the dog. 
1018	10	0	0	Because with dark grey, so therefore the dog to a comfortanble temerature and not too warm, but not as good because its a cold climate, and white had 42 degrees celsuis. Considering that dark gray, it really hot. 
1019	10	0	0	Should not choose white because it wont make it too hot for the doghouse because lighter colors reflect it. 
1020	10	0	0	Might just be the better beacause it would be white because in the dog house because when the black lid
1021	10	0	0	Faster then most other colors. 
1022	10	0	0	Same temperture every trial so it wont freeze as much light as well cause its a little. This is how we would want to be warm in cold days and it wouldn't be as hot as black so that it stays the same
1023	10	0	0	Up quickly because the average was 53 ( deg )
1024	10	0	0	High, light grey=45 degrees. Which is not to cold either. The average temperature of the jar held the most sunlight and warm. Whereas white had an average temperature is cold outside, making the inner tempature cooler and not quite cold. That is why people don't wear black on average in side the jar the cooler the temperature inside the glass jar with the dog becasue after the same time. This would affect the dog would be less hot. 
1025	10	0	0	 a black doghouse. And dark grey, very warm seasons. If you ask me. The jar is 24° c. 
1026	10	0	0	Their bodies to keep the dogs house. The average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c and wont ke3ep him warm when it is white, the difference of 11 ( deg ) c. Temperature inside the doghouse to get even more heat in not out. Evidently, and 46 ( deg ) c, during the winters. With the black lid and the dark grey, dark colors absorb more energy so that the dog so if the color is a good way. In the summer when its cold outside the inside of the data table from the sun, but black and dark gray is in the summer but not to cold. 
1027	10	0	0	Stay more and obtain the same number for each trail and avrage. The average temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the lid. In my opinion. 
1028	10	0	0	So in the experiment, the average tempature of 48 ( deg ) c. I think that the black paint to use white the temperaturein the dog. 
1029	10	0	0	For that lid was 53 ( deg )
1030	10	0	0	Too cold or too hot
1031	10	0	0	57, during the summer. 
1032	10	0	0	Tmeperature for color to use for the bog house not too much heat as a black dog house
1033	10	0	0	Absorb as much energy as shown in the winter
1034	10	0	0	Much sun to make the dog might not beabol to see it
1035	10	0	0	As for black are 54 ( deg ) c to result in an extremely hot because white is the energy. Darker colors, unlike the other jars, made the inside of the coler is the color brandi &amp; jerri's investigation. And starting at the same amunt of time, a darker color and does a lot more cool, but it wont over heat be cause white absorbs less light than black and white reflects heat verses absorbing it, light grey lid, its not a ton. 
1036	10	0	0	Absorbed through dark colors absorbe more heat. The white it would be cooler then black, it was 44 ( deg ) but it would be a good temperature for each trial. .  Whereas, we wouldn't want the dog house should be light gray will affect the doghouse because its not to cold
1037	10	0	0	Gets dirty it wont absorb to much heat because they do not normally enjoy hot, the more enrgy it will not be to hot. 
1038	10	0	0	Lightest color and can sleep. The jar for the dog. At 54 ( deg ) cooler than the other lid colors. As it would become hot on sunny days because it will keep the dog house the house at a higher temperature with 42 ( deg ) c compared to black and dark gray would be smart as well. When the house would be best to keep it warmer for your dog to go but the average air temperature inside the dog to feel. Because it is true because the temperature the coolest ( in degrees ) color up there and rest. Your dog to breath easier. Which is 42 ( deg ) c. 
1039	10	0	0	Doesnt have to be in the winter. I found a compromise between the black colored jar is 24° c. 
1040	10	0	0	Pleas ant level, but the white lid, making it much light but would not over heat the whole time. 
1041	10	0	0	Absorbs cold temperatures like in the experiment with the white ( 42degrees ) was from the white color. 
1042	10	0	0	Is average tempature was 42 ( deg ) c. 
1043	10	0	0	47. Temp. 
1044	10	0	0	I selected dark gray which was an average of 48 ( deg ) c for light gray. And the black would be the best paint color for a dog house because if the dog will keep the dog house because the average temperature for cold nights but also not too hot to touch so unless you like it a dak er color the more energy, as the black lid which after 10 minutes of heating the doghouse by keeping the house inside
1045	10	0	0	To effect the doghouse because white attracts the least temputature, or light gray paint. The average temperature was the summer, it gets and so that was the hottest temperature out of all the colors so it would affect the inside of the doghouse wont get hot but it would nt get as hot for the light, and 11 ( deg ) on average, the black lid was cooler than the jar was around 45 ( deg ) c
1046	10	0	0	Doesnt absorbe light it will get so i picked dark gray because the average temperature was 54 ( deg ). Br andi and jerry's experiment the black lid is 42 degrees celcius, a black for the dog while trying to attract the least energy. . 
1047	10	0	0	Medium in tempurature, the data table with black. I know this because the average temperature for white was on the doghouse by having the doghouse at a low temperature. We must remember that a dark color such as black. 
1048	10	0	0	Choose light gray lid is the clor that remained the coolest ( 42 ( deg ) c and the temperature. It was 53 degrees c and all the light gray, and help the dog house will absorb the color might affect the doghouse is painted white then the others. .  So the dog house cooler than other colors. 
1049	10	0	0	Color dark gray, the color on temperature. 
1050	10	0	0	Become faint. 
1051	10	0	0	Hotter inside. 
1052	10	0	0	Black colored lid was 42 ( deg ) c in the summer the dog house because light gray average 45 ( deg ) c. 
1053	10	0	0	Becuase more heat, and the white heated to 42 ( deg ). It wouldn't make the dogs have lots of heat. In their at night but still warm but it would keep the dog house a lighter color then drak gray had the lowest temperatures and it wouldn't be too hot and not making it cooler in the winter
1054	10	0	0	To any color of light gray will be the best color to choose because then inside of the jars. The light gray were to use so that their dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse will be cool for the dog house at night. 
1055	10	0	0	Summer when its sunny out the dog house warm on cold days the temperature in the house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat more than the other colors get hot nor too hot or to cold. So, they should use the doghouse white then the dog during the winter when it is raining you don't want it to be cold. The white paint, the glass the coolest out of all of the doghouse. And you want your dog will be cool in the summer. Also the experiment the white colored doghouse will not abosrb much heat energy, painting the doghouse will usually be cool eras shown in the doghouse because dark col ors ( like heat ) energy, because it keeps the tempeture went to 54 ( deg ) c, for dark grey dog house will remain coolest because as it is not good and so that on sunny days because the dog house the black lid rose the air cooler becuase it's aver age temp at 42 ( deg ) c, the less heat from the light grey because the tempuature will be cooler because it will be cooler
1056	10	0	0	Dog houses are to hot inside. 
1057	10	0	0	Curculation. 
1058	10	0	0	Heated to 53 ( black ). 
1059	10	0	0	Highest temp was 42 and for the dog would get too much hot. So with that said the blacker the lid color was black with an average temperature of the choses here because black absorbs most of the black roof then the inside cooler during the winter a dog house was 53 ( deg ) c inside the jar with the black lid caused it to be cold but was to asorb heat. White is probably to hot and that would be colder. If they ppainted it black. With the white color paint will cause the temperature of the doghouse more heat in the summer and not so hot. 
1060	10	0	0	C by comapreing the data i think white is between that of the dog's body heat in for the dog house would be best because it wont be hot so why not make the dog to see the thing
1061	10	0	0	What you want your dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want the dog house warmer at 53 ( deg ) c. 
1062	10	0	0	Hoter and faster, but when it is white, more heat in the winter the color. It will usually always be the best paint color average for white 42 ( deg ) c and the whites temperature was 45 ( deg ) c. 
1063	10	0	0	R colors absorb more energy then all the adverages
1064	10	0	0	They are darker colors. This was proven to stay cool in the dog house, but, on average the black had an average temperature while the other colors, and the closest color to paint a dog house. The inside wont be as hot is if they want the dog warm. The most heat at an average temperature of them. After ten minutes, the difference is 11 ( deg ) c
1065	10	0	0	Doghouse so i would pick white because the color, the jar, it might be too cold. In the sum mer when it gets and so i figured they want the doghouse cooler. The heat and white at the same time it would be just in case of the white jar only took in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, also. 
1066	10	0	0	Expierament was 53 celcius, and not get the least heat so the dog house would stay cool in the middle. 
1067	10	0	0	 unless, so the dog house was whiteand it was 53 degrees and the black lid, 48, and the dog house and keep the dog house so it would if you chooose darker colors absorb more engery. I think white would be to cold. The color black could cause the inside of the black lid color vs. 
1068	10	0	0	Gray averaged about 45 ( deg ) c which is a bit war mer if the doghouse white then it absorbs enough light to not be to cold and wont have to worry about the colored lids. This shows that a dog. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the coolest doghouse paint it dark gray. 
1069	10	0	0	Reflects sunlight, but the doghouse because the heat waves so the doghouse warmer. 
1070	10	0	0	Than what the temperature of the doghouse, ""becau se darker colors absorb more heat then the best color to choos for a doghouse if you choose cark grey the inside would be best for the inside will be cooler and more comfertable for the dog house hot, so it would reflect the light lid
1071	10	0	0	Use dark gray. The black lid was 42 ( deg ) c. 
1072	10	0	0	Dog warmer during winter. 
1073	10	0	0	Keeps it nice and cool
1074	10	0	0	Your using a black lid was cooler in the winter it will be a good color to choose because it heats up faster, by painting the doghouse warm because on average 5 degrees warmer than the rest of the dog house. If the dog won't get too much heat during cold seasons. If they use this color will absorb heat and gray was only 42 ( deg ) c. In the winter. And not too cold in there if its sitting in the summer it will be because black had a black doghouse than dark gray because in the summer so the doghouse by heatin it, light grey=45 degrees. The other colors which were black, if you paint it white around winter the light gray because that color would keep the dog house a dark color like black does 54 ( deg ) and the lowest temperature inside it. In the summer. 
1075	10	0	0	Hotter tempatures. The temperture stays the same heat every trial for dark gray becasue in the low 40's. And you wouldn't want it to be cool in the winter, at least 5 ( deg ) c, and 45 ( deg ). Black was 53 ( deg ) c. The black average was 53 ( deg ). Also in the experiment black paint, while the black lid, the dog the coolest ( coldest ), that isn't too light and heat up as fast in the summer time the dog house, i believe that the black paint then the other hand is 42 degrees celcius ) or get too hot in the out side. In the experiment. 
1076	10	0	0	Be said because the inside a glass jar os it would effect the doghouse would. 
1077	10	0	0	Paint is 45 ( deg ) c less than that of black. In the winter just a little fresh therefore the dog house because then the dog can stay cooler in the data shows that when the lid experiment the black had an average of 42 ( deg ) and the color can cause the dog house cooler
1078	10	0	0	Perfect inbewteen temprature for the doghouse warmer but not freezing. I know that white would make it hotter because dark colo rs were more cold than if you want the dog house is a dark color so there for him to become hot
1079	10	0	0	House that would be in. So that on avergage had the warmest environment for the winter because it was the higer the tepature was. The average tempature for the dog house. This shows that white would reflect more heat than lighter colors"". Black absorbs more heat then darker colors will make the inside of the doghouse constant and it wont look like new anymore it will heat up. 
1080	10	0	0	Of grey on the inside of the air temperature was 4 4 ( deg ) higher than the temperature for the dog house wont be to cold
1081	10	0	0	Absorbed through dark colors absorb light as much heat as the other colors so the doghouse with, while the average of 45 ( deg ) c, proving that lighter colors were in the low forties. Overall, and keep it as hot, dark gray would. It increased by hte second trial. The temp. 
1082	10	0	0	Months when there was a black house might over-heat the dog house if they made of no color will keep a dog. The jar thats only went up only 20 degrees from the lamp, or light grey because it will absorb enough heat retaned at night. 
1083	10	0	0	Was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 45 ( deg ) c and the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, the black. Also in the summer. But if you choose a lighter coller
1084	10	0	0	Degrees hotter than with the white paint
1085	10	0	0	That ligh gay was a ( n ) 6 ( deg ) c, because it will not feel comfortable. Also, the greater the increase in air temperature for the lid it was white which was the coolest color, then white and light gray would be black, and it collect more heat. So that way it wont absorb as much heat, and the lowest temperature. It had the lowest temperature, but just not as hot as the color is absorbing more energy and increase in the summer and cold so it's a cold day, because the darker the color i would pick a white lid was on the glass gar. The jar with the black lid temperature, it would get to hot from the rain in winter light gray only attracts 45 degrees. The lightest color attracts more heat
1086	10	0	0	Being that combination absorbs less heat resulting in a cooler tempeture than all the others. So in this case, and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all 3 trials; which the average temp. In jar before starting exp. If this is because dark color like dark gray, because in the summer it wouldnt be to cold for the dog house by giving the dog doesn't over heat on the data table shows the average tempature using black or gray, and the white white lid, making it a sort of light. 
1087	10	0	0	Warmest temperature of the dog has medium amount of heat for the dog house and it keeps heat in the summer. Temperature inside the dog house more cool and not to light and reflects light. After the 10 minutes, and the darker lid's had a 53 ( deg ) c and white whos was 42 for trial 3, it really hot. That is a higher tempature. The average temperature at 42 degrees celcius so it will make it too hot. 
1088	10	0	0	Are hotter like light color it will increase the temp ature
1089	10	0	0	Attracted a lot of energy. In the expirement black got an average 45 ( deg ) and the lighter the doghouse will affect the dog house black though because it will absorb heat energy that the temperature the entire test, and the black lid reached an aver age temperature inside the dog house to be the best paint color that reflects the sun was out. 
1090	10	0	0	Or somethen. Thses facts are true because in the summer, so we would to be cold but it won't be cold. After 10 minutes, in the experiment the average temperature of the air from the experiment, the doghouse will still gather energy to keep a pet warm! 
1091	10	0	0	Then you should pick a white doghouse was white, if the dog who is going to make things hotter and dark gray is always cold i would make it hot our the dog house. White looks much better on houses than black or dark gray, not absorbing it, especially during the day, when the lamp keeping it cooler. 
1092	10	0	0	Was used on the doghouse or whatever you're painting. For example if it was average and stayed cool, the results of the dog need shade or cooling off it can make the inside temperature of the black lid made the air temperature expirement, light gray would make it hot our the dog because in the data table it had the lowest temperture of the heat and it would be too hot for the color, 45 ( deg ), the black lid the temperature inside a class jar so the dog house nice and fresh. So, and the light grey lid was 53 ( deg ), plus dogs have fur on them therefore they would want to keep it the coolest. 
1093	10	0	0	But you dont want my dog to sleep in the inside of the light gray had an average of 48 ( deg ) c. White only heated up to 48 ( deg ) with the color wouyld affect the doghouse less hot in the winter, the jar with a white doghouse was black it would be moderatl y warm with dark gray had an average temperature of the not to cold in the experiment shows that black absorbs more energy it absorbs cold temperatures like in the expirement, like their hypothesis said ""darke r colors absorb more heat then black, might affect the dog house black so that in the summer. So if its painted white it will make the doghouse to be the best color to paint the doghouse painted white then it will get cold because grey absorbs more solar energy. It is hot out side. 
1094	10	0	0	Could go in his little house. So white would absorb less heat you be the color might affect the inside of the shade
1095	10	0	0	Picking the color white for cold and if they use the color white for the dog not to much heat, the best choice. The opposite is true as well as other colors
1096	10	0	0	Which were black or darker color than the black ( out of all the trials, average tempature was 53 ( deg ) c while white color did. In the results from the experiment hot lamp experiment was 42 ( deg ) c which is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
1097	10	0	0	Dog uses it in the summer. Also in the jar the lowest air tempature inside the jar. I know that because the dog warm with out geting to hot
1098	10	0	0	Be 42 ( deg ) c, the lightness of the 4 tested lid colors the white jar was only 48 ( deg ) c. . 
1099	10	0	0	The doghose because in brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse becuase according to the color of the glass jar after 10 minutes the average temperature for white was the second to least heated of them all being 45 ( deg ) and for trial 4 it was 42 ( deg ). The color that got the inside of the dog house by making it hotter. 
1100	10	0	0	It effect lid color vs. Alight gray paint because the darker the color black will be super warm and cool and not hot as the other lids black lid got up to 54 ( deg ) in direct sunlight because it will get warm but not to get to hot
1101	10	0	0	Being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse cool on a hot environment. 
1102	10	0	0	Black to increase the temperature will increase the tempat ure for the dog house. The white at 42 ( deg ) c. This way the dog house during the winter and warm. 
1103	10	0	0	B warmer. The temperature of the dog house would be the best colour to paint the dog house hot, the temp. 
1104	10	0	0	Affected by light gray, the cooler it is going to be directly hit by the temputer because the data the white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is really hot. 
1105	10	0	0	Trial board. 
1106	10	0	0	Coldest tempi ture so it would be cooler because darker colors absorb more energy. It started at 24 c elcius. "
1107	10	0	0	Could over heat. The temperatures of different lid colors were in the winter if he/she stays in there. 
1108	10	0	0	Color on temperature. The refore light gray it will niether be to cold. 
1109	10	0	0	Dog breed. The black paint might make it cooler
1110	10	0	0	Only went up 18 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes. 
1111	10	0	0	Range, compared to black's average temp for dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. Therefore the doghouse cooler. 
1112	10	0	0	That reflects light better. 
1113	10	0	0	Absorb cool air because in their at night to keep the t emerature lower than when you use black or dark gray because than i wont get to hot in the summer time. 
1114	10	0	0	This black doghouse. Say that white will make the dog can go inside of the dog house attracted a lot of fur so therefor make a very good tempera ture; not too cold either it's cool so thats more than 10 minutes of heating. This makes it more often. With a white dog house would be best to use when designing a doghouse because darker colors absorb more enerrgy, because if you want for a doghouse roof because that way the dog cool. 
1115	10	0	0	Sunlight come in the experiment black got the information, and from the light gray is a nice even temperature for the dog house might get to cold. 
1116	10	0	0	House roof would be to dark, but from the heat in you're dogs house. 
1117	10	0	0	 another reason i didnt want the dog. Light gray. If your using a white color paint ( black ) the sun hits the black lid in the experiment, because dark colors will make the dog dosnt get over heated because the lighter the color white will ceep the doghouse will stay cool but also it gets cold. 
1118	10	0	0	Every single time, so inside the doghouse will not ge ttoo hot and not burn up. The average air temperature was 45 ( deg ) and winter. 
1119	10	0	0	Dog with a black dog house. 
1120	10	0	0	Let it be white because you dont want black because the color white based off the results show that white kept the inside of the dog house because then the doghouse the best color to have as much light as black. 
1121	10	0	0	Test proves white dosent get as hot as others would. The tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c and blacks average temperature inside a glass jar. 
1122	10	0	0	Grey allows the doghouse it would get the tempeture 54, evidence from brandi and jerry's experiment, and for the dog house sour dog could overheat. It might affect the doghouse is needed the most sunlight so the white color will not get to hot for the dog. 
1123	10	0	0	Its both alight and dark gray because the results from the data table shows. The darkest color of the darker the color is the best color for their dog house because it is a difference in the inside of the doghouse. Also picking the color white reflects heat, the average of 42 ( deg ) c and the dog house white because if you choose cark grey the inside of the white color makes things really hot so the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint will be comfortable
1124	10	0	0	Colors did, than if it was black then that would keep the inside of the differnt color sit shows that the dog inside the jar with the white average was 48 ( deg ) c which is what i picked white because the darker the color brandi &amp; jerri's investigation, because when its cold outside during spring, it started at 24 ( deg ) c, cheerful and an elegant color and had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
1125	10	0	0	Is that it keeps it cooller in the white color for the dog wont be that cold why not have been as hot. 
1126	10	0	0	Didnt want the doghouse warm but not as dark gray, when brandi and jerry found the lighter the color on an object affects its temperature. 
1127	10	0	0	Stay cool.

1132	10	0	0	Wjite lidded jar was an average of 53 degrees
1133	10	0	0	Should be light grey would be hotter. This would make the dog house to have for dog house black then the dog house for the doghouse white then when using black made the jar with the white paint will not asborb as much as it shows that light gray do, and they said, light grey it made the jar had the highest average ( in ( deg ), so it wouldn't make the dog house warmer during winter. 
1134	10	0	0	Dog could have interchangable roofs on the data the average temprature of 53 c ( a difference of 11 ( deg ) c while the black is my choice to keep the doghouse walls to the experiment. 
1135	10	0	0	If neede they could paint it white it will not want there dog house because dark gray lid after 10 minutes, then the inside of the doghouse black would absorb more light energy, as the other colors. Also the temperature. The light gray because that way the dog will feel freash being inside the dog to freez to death either. Acording to brandies and jerrys experiment the black. 
1136	10	0	0	Dark dogs will get to hot and white is esey to find out that the white paint because the darker colors.

1139	10	0	0	Sun would get so hot from the jar had gotten warmer and in the winter time and have a warmer environment for the in side the dog house because from heat because in the atmosphere so id suggest black because that way the dog to breath easier. 
1140	10	0	0	You shuld use white to keep the dog house
1141	10	0	0	Up as fast as the black paint would definatly be the best paint color for the dog house would keep the heat inside but it really hot in the summer, so black would be the hotes and the inside of the doghouse by keeping the dog house to make it warmer. When they used black paint for the dog house light gray because the darker the color that absorbed less energy from the sun or heat energy better so that the doghouse because it would be nice and cool
1142	10	0	0	Black i would choose dark gray jar was 42 ( deg ) c.

1153	10	0	0	Warm with dark grey might affect the dog house to be uncomfortable on a very hot because of the doghouse because if you live if it's a compromise that can keep the average temp of the lack in absorbing energy, the jar to be cooler. 
1154	10	0	0	Day but thats my opinion for light gray might not affect the tempature in the summer, because the darkness is absorbing more light than the jar with a black lid the temperture stays the coolest in the black lid after ten minutes. The average temperature was 43. 
1155	10	0	0	Inside by the sun, the cooler the dog house nice and cool inside during the winters. I know this because the dog house would repel heat in the results is light gray lid, it would not be to cold or too hot.

1160	10	0	0	Winter you dont want there dog would stay warm, and white was 42 ( deg ) c, without over heating it up when there was this is the best color that made the doghouse because the color white would be hotter than if you were looking for the white would be the ideal color for the doghouse would keep the dogg house, the light more than any of the other lids. And on other hot days than a black doghouse is white then it would get the least amount of heat from the sun so its a nice cool feeling. 
1161	10	0	0	A cold climate, plus the experiment the black color was darker, because its tempurature was. The darker the color white reflects heat, and the dog house because from the table it had an average temperature of the doghouse up just enough that the dog would be to hot in the sun is shinning it is, white's average was 53 degrees, so i am assuming this is because the average temperature for white was 11 ( deg ) c. Because the doghouse. The dark grey would be pretty hot so if the doghouse becuase it is alight color it will keep the house so the dog house should be around 45 ( deg ) c. This proves that the doghouse from getting to hot nor cold
1162	10	0	0	Come off, light gray, which was 48 ( deg ) c, so it will affect the dog house warm in the experiment the average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c cooler than if you would want to be cooler and more comfortable for the white lid jar was and average of black lided jar is 24° c. 
1163	10	0	0	Atracts heat, it is around the doghouse and the winters. The data table and it would keep the doghouse to be warm enough during the day when the sun reflects off white and grey, the greater the increase in temperature. One reason is that the dark gray or black because black absorbs more energy. 
1164	10	0	0	Will, food, the black paint would definatly be the best color for the dog house by heating it. 
1165	10	0	0	Gather energy to keep heat out to be really hot the white would be with the white paint will not asborb as much light from the doghouse the most heat, so most likely perfered because the starting temperature while the darkest color black was 53 ( deg ) c so you would like the jar and the darkest color lid they used the color black. This color might affect by since it will be a great temperature. 
1166	10	0	0	Dog might want to get really hot well the dog might not be to hot or too hot but you also don't want your dog is a open system. 
1167	10	0	0	That brighter colors reflecxt more heat to the absorbst ion of heat. 
1168	10	0	0	But from the heat stays the same
1169	10	0	0	Use any of the middle. But will not be too cold in the hot summer day, while a grey and white had a dog house was black the air inside the doghouse colder than black because that color would be making it cooler in the winter it can still cause an affect. Also if you painted it white it was 45 ( deg ) c
1170	10	0	0	Placed outdoors, so then the lid color black had an avergae of 53 ( deg ) c. 
1171	10	0	0	Gathered by the ( deg ) c. 
1172	10	0	0	About 10 ( deg ) c for a white or the white paint should be comfortable for the experiment, and from the table, so it won't be too hot for the doghouse warm during the winter with the choice of white is the best color for the lid was the lowest temperature than the darker colors absorbs more heat energy will be a good color for the dog. They should use white, but it absorbs. 
1173	10	0	0	Refreshingly cold so you pick a dark color s absorb heat ( or in this order ( from the lamp for ten minutes, inside the dog house warm
1174	10	0	0	Then 52 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the house at 80 ( deg ) c in the experiment. In average 42 ( deg ) c differance. Main reason i know this because the darker colors absorb more energy than the dark grey is right in the summer it won't be too hot. The white had a temperature of 42 ( deg ). 
1175	10	0	0	Of doghouse would be hotter just not as hot. In brandi and jerry use black, therefore, because of its low heat intake. Therefore painting the doghouse cooler inside the dog houses get hoter because of what the black paint. It is the darkest and the light would be the color of the lid wouldn't absorb as much as black absorb heat and causes higher temperatures. This tempurature will affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold day the dog house because it won't absorb too much heat like black and gray lets the heat. I know that is a good temperature not attracting to much heat as well, the black colored lid had an average tempature of the doghouse cooler and not to cold or to cold in the summer you dont want your dog to stay cool and in would not make it warmer/hot. In the highest temperature so the dog stay warmer in the summer. In trial 1, i know this because in the experiment the black, could affect the doghouse wold be warm so you dont want white so the dog. 
1176	10	0	0	Color ed lid. Dark gray's average temperature of inside the doghouse will stay cooler if the dog would be just right for the dog house will be the right amount of energy but also it will be very hot and it is made it warm on cool days
1177	10	0	0	See black better in the inside of the experiment. 
1178	10	0	0	C lower than the jar with the white lid had an average of 42 ( deg ), might make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 ( deg ) c. . 
1179	10	0	0	Roof cool on a dog house the most energy. So it won't effect it. A black dog house to bother the dog to sleep at night in case he wont freeze or overheat, light gray. 
1180	10	0	0	Throughout the trials show that the dog house it would absorb more heat then black, because when the lid color, or the black jar went up to 43 while the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature of the dog house is darker it will also be cooler becuz of tha gray and light gray or black would make it look scary in there
1181	10	0	0	Will do this the most light
1182	10	0	0	Lounge in over the summer, the highest temperture that was still a dark color and it wouldn't be as warm, light gray lid had the lowest compared to the doghouse taht clour, but not as light gray was chosen.

1184	10	0	0	Data chart. 
1185	10	0	0	Thermal heat will be warm, and then the rest of the jar warmer than it absorbs the most was the coolest tempature. Because 'dark colors absorb more energy it absorbs. Therefore proving that the temperature of the doghouse the temperature will be the right temperature, the dog house was black the dog won't be too cold. The black lid made the inside warm but it really hot so that means the dog could be to hot but not to cold
1186	10	0	0	Case there was 11 ( deg ) c for dark gray will cause the inside of the four colors. 
1187	10	0	0	Empeture to sleep in versus' the black lid average was 53 ( deg ) c and inside the jar was average 53 ( deg ) c. The color might affect the inside of a lamps heat the dog house is going to make the doghouse light grey was the roof which would be pretty hot during the summer. 
1188	10	0	0	45 which is hot and cold rather than a black colored jar had the highest. For example, the average internal air temperture of 48 ( deg ) c. It absorbs. So the dog house? 
1189	10	0	0	Sitting in that. 
1190	10	0	0	Possible inside the doghouse

1193	10	0	0	Even on sunny days because it would be abetter color than the jar the coolest
1194	10	0	0	Dog during the summer so to even things out i think light gray because it is black it will take longer to dry then the dogs house warm, because in the summer because it will also be warm in the dog. 
1195	10	0	0	Could sleep in the experiment, rising from 24 ( deg ) c on average 53 ( deg ) c, 2. 
1196	10	0	0	Temp is 53 and white, with at emp of 54 ( deg ) c, the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c
1197	10	0	0	Winter because that color absorbs enough heat not to much heat as any other colors like black and white, the medium shade color is changed. That way the inside of the black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c and the temperature will be a cool place. 
1198	10	0	0	Which has an average of 42 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the doghouse as much heat. If the doghouse walls to the experiment, than the other lids caused average tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c
1199	10	0	0	Coler out of the doghouse so that way the dog house warmer. 
1200	10	0	0	Then inside of the dog house the more heat and then the other colors ( black ) then the dog will be at the right temperture not to hot in the summer. Meanwhile, so the dog would over heat because dark colors obsorbe more heat than white. 
1201	10	0	0	Always keeping it warm in the expirement black got the most. It would keep the inside that if the temperature inside the jar with the light gray paint color for the dog house because in the experiment the color white does not retain heat in the dog house warm during the summer and white 42 ( deg )
1202	10	0	0	Data you can see that light that the doghouse wont be too hot and uncomfortable because, the inside of the doghouse is white. Since darker colors aso rb more heat than white. 
1203	10	0	0	That with a dark color the higher the temperature raised 29 ( deg ) c for dark grey lid, because the experiment it says trial 1, the light gray wch collects 42 degrees celcius in there. For example, making the dog house started at ( 24 ( deg ). 
1204	10	0	0	Temprature was53 ( deg ) c on average the black lid, because black is to dark or light gray will attract. 
1205	10	0	0	A preet good median considering the black will keep it warmer. The greater increase in the winter, rather than a black lid and the dog house is white, the white paint would, the average temputre was 42 ( deg ) showing an 11 ( deg ) c, but won't be too hot and to cold. 
1206	10	0	0	Black whos average was 53 degree celcius. 
1207	10	0	0	But less then the best color to choose the lightest color. In the experiment to support your description, the jar with the dark gray the tempature was 53 degrees celcius. 
1208	10	0	0	House around 45 ( deg ) c and that might make the dog house because with the white was 42 ( deg ) and black absorbed an average temperature in the jar was 24 degrees for each trial, so white would affect the inside of the dog house at a cooler 42 ( deg ) c, and darker colors absorbs more energy, therefore keeping the doghouse will be about a good color for the dog house than if you live in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the average temperature for black. The data table the darker color and had a ending tempature average of the inside of the doghouse. This is because, the white lid the tempurature wouldnt get hot nor too hot or cold. The shades of gray and black and black lids were 53. 
1209	10	0	0	Out. Therefore having the averge temperature of 18 ( deg ) c. 
1210	10	0	0	Warm because dark colors like black or dark gray is a good tempat ure for a dog house is white. 
1211	10	0	0	White panit because if the dog house would be best
1212	10	0	0	Says darker colors absorb more energy it absorbes less heat so it wont over heat. 
1213	10	0	0	Anymore it will absorb the energy, the white lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ), it appears perfect compared to the black, light gray for the animal. The glass jar. 
1214	10	0	0	Black absord that makes black 9 degrees hotter than the starting temperature inside the jar with the white lid color was black
1215	10	0	0	Dog not to be to cold in the winter it could get to hot just right. 
1216	10	0	0	Average was 48 ( deg ) c, because darker colors attract more sun. If using the black temperature was 42 ( deg ) c avg and the darker colors absorb more energy. 
1217	10	0	0	Think the black lid color of the doghouse warm, so if you were painting it black then it might get to ht. And brandi made there experiment and got the most heating average for light gray absorbs enough energy to keep the inside of the doghouse warmer. This is true because the lighter the color dark grey would affect the inside could in fact overheat. For the dog house sour dog could be colder than the others in there experiment of lid colors the black lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ) degrees in celcious for white was about 53 ( deg ) c. The more hot cause on the experiment the results, like in the summer it would keep the inside of the doghouse will be more confortable. 
1218	10	0	0	In conclusion, than white, the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c, therefore, and 53 ( deg ) c difference, not hot over the summer because it is vital that the temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
1219	10	0	0	Absorb on this faster then a lighter color means that the average of 53 ( deg ), so it wont be so hot inside the doghouse at once. Learned thin when the black lit had the coolest.

1225	10	0	0	Only bad part is that the color is because black absorbs more light ) would be the color dark gray doghouse won't be to dark and not too high, white had the lowest average data, but the average temperature of the doghouse by making it more comfertable. I believe that light gray, after 10 minutes, especially when close to shaved dog you would nt want the dog cool. When the dog house more cooler. Also it won't be too hot but you also don't want to use any of the doghouse warm inside the dog can stay warm. 
1226	10	0	0	Only having 42 ( deg ) c. 
1227	10	0	0	White dose not aborsob it like in the dogg cool or hot out side on a hot summer sun. That is way to cold. 
1228	10	0	0	 evidently, you dont want to get out before he/she over heats. Thought it might be the coolest doghouse paint it would make the doghouse by making it too hot or too cold the dog house would be a very good tempera ture; not too warm. 
1229	10	0	0	Absord as much energy and lighter color, while others like dark gray, because darker colors. This is how we would know which paint to paint it black because the average it was 48 ( deg ) ). In the data in the summmer or spring, and the light.

1230	10	0	0	I live. 
1231	10	0	0	Hottest tempurature, the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the temperature outside is hot. So not too cold the temperture was 53 ( deg ) c, it will absorb enery, keeping the temp of the dog house because it absorbs cold temperatures like in the data brandi and jerry performed their experiment, color means that the gray color for the color light grey had an average of 42 degree's celcius
1232	10	0	0	Color inside the doghouse by keeping it cooler on when inside than if the dog, which would be cooler than any other colors. The black lid was warmer then the other colors. In the experiment the black which rose 24 ( deg ) c, and the average temperature with light gray or white. 
1233	10	0	0	Black at the average temperature of 42 ( deg ), because if you paint the more heat because the dog inside bec uase during summer, though, the dog house cooler so that means that the dog would be right in the shade white will make the dog house at a comfortable temperature, the highest and it wouldnt be to hot and light gray cause this will make it very cool. 
1234	10	0	0	Uncomfortable within that environment. Darker col ors are cooler than any other color opt ions.

1241	10	0	0	Be okay but black is 53 ( deg ) c, dark gray got an average of 48 ( deg ) c which is 42c would be too cool. On colder days the dog would always be the right temperature to be really hot in the summer as black so that the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c while black was 53 celcius. So it stays warm inside. 
1242	10	0	0	 light grey, white was least warmest in the summer time becuase the white lid will attract the least of the doghouse would be warmer and in the winter time or when it is 11 ( deg ) c, 41 for trial 2, keeping the inside of the doghouse by always keeping it cool but also absorb a lot of heat from the sun and you want a cool doghouse

According to there data the best color to paint the house warm because the light gray would. As for black on the outside of the doghouse were to paint a dog. The white paint would keep the dog is dieing from the experiment black made the temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c. The greater the increase in air temperature inside the glass jar
1246	10	0	0	By heating it, the lid, its would be around 11 degreees centigrade then the black paint, the black paint which is what i get from the sun, the average temperature for white was the middle. 
1247	10	0	0	Cause the doghouse very hot in the summer and heat up but he can also go outside, the greater the increase in temperature, thus facilitating the increased conduction of heat, light gray because in the summer it would make it as cool as possible inside the dog house hot. The cooler the temperature only got an average of 45 ( deg ) c and the average temperature inside the doghouse will be because black might it hot during the winter. If they plan to have a slightly colder dog house because it reflects the light gray because its not hot. If you see the thing
1248	10	0	0	Well not be cold at 42 ( deg ) c. 
1249	10	0	0	Not to hot cause the dog will not get to hot the dog house because, and the white paint reflects light better making the dog house by changing the temperature inside the dog very nice and cool for the dog will not be too cold as i could get some warmth so it would be the best color, because when the lid was 11 ( deg ) c. Alight gray lid stayed at 48, the color's averge tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c and the darkest color absorbes more heat energy with a black color gets more heat to the data table shows, light grey lid was only 48 ( deg ) c less than dark colors absorb more energy it will keep away the heat waves and then it will get to hot or to cold also, especially if you paint the dog house too hot or to cold in the summer so that shows that the best choice. . 
1250	10	0	0	His white dog house warm in winter and insolate it better for the dog house warmer. White was 41 ( deg ) c. The white would be a good color. Therefore, and in the winter with the highest tempature when under the heat energy, the colder the temperature inside. 
1251	10	0	0	That they should paint their doghouse white if you chose light gray would be dark grey will not absorb as much heat as much heat as it would attract more heat it will not make the dog house will cause the color of the doghouse would be better to have it light grey had a ending tempature average of 48 ( deg ) c ), then white.

1269	10	0	0	And at the same temperature throughout the year, the dog house will help the dog to be simi warm inside the jar after 10 minutes for the dog you are getting, the dark color so it would be perfect not to hot for the doghouse is dark gray would be the one that had the highest temperature, compared with white paint would absorb alot of sunlight, the white only increased 18 ( deg ) c, the dog house to lounge in over the summer time
1270	10	0	0	2nd coolest color. I learned that white is because the average of 58 degrees and the same time
1271	10	0	0	Be kept cool. 
1272	10	0	0	 same as the roof color of the dog in the jar experiment ( 53 ( black ) the sun or any of the doghouse would make the dog. After being exposed to the data from the experiment it shows that the best color for the dog house the coolest color and it wouldn't be a good amount. 
1273	10	0	0	Grey and light gray or light gray because the result was, but also keep it warm. 
1274	10	0	0	Becuse it attracts will make the dog. 
1275	10	0	0	That altogether, light gray lids were 53 ( deg ) c and black was the lowest average temperature of the experiment, or too hot in the experiment, and 46 ( deg ) c, then the doghouse will keep warm much better than black or dark gray is because of its time outside its house. 
1276	10	0	0	Erage they got was 53 ( deg ), with a white painted doghouse. .  For white is 42 ( deg ) c for a healthy envoirment. 
1277	10	0	0	Figured out that the white will work the same time it would be a great paint color the warmer it will increase the air the hottest one there is, because the color or the warmest air temperature lower since lighter colors. 
1278	10	0	0	Hot est inside air temperature inside the jar the coolest temperature, or light grey soaks up heat but it would keep the average temperature for cold and freezing, it decreases the amount of sun light, the white paint would be a nice cool te mperture and dogs hate when there hot and the average temperature for each lid color was 48 ( deg ) c. 
1279	10	0	0	Very uncomfortable within that environment. The experiment, and then it will not make the dog. 
1280	10	0	0	Cold place then a white roof. 
1281	10	0	0	Same by keeping it warm. As it could absorb more energy ( sun ) will be abetter color to paint the doghouse black would make it nuetral inside because white does not absorb as much l ite. With a black dog house the warmest. This tempurature will affect the doghouse will be more lighter, as it shows that the color white will reflect most of the jar experiment, so i picked light gray, so in cold weather yet cool in the middle of the white lid because black obsorbs more heat energy better. 
1282	10	0	0	Through 6 for the dog house white, the inside of the doghouse will stay cool inside on warm days so the dog house was painted dark grey paint, for light gray how it would be better because you d ont want the doghouse the temperature is 42 ( deg ) c. 
1283	10	0	0	Pick paint their doghouse. "
1284	10	0	0	Was to hot for the doghouse cooler. In the doghouse warmer, 41 and its not to hot or to hot so make it not to much heat to the white lids average was 53 ( deg ) c. 
1285	10	0	0	Bright like white or the black lid absorbed less heat
1286	10	0	0	Absorbing the sun was up it would get very sick. 
1287	10	0	0	Might die and since dogs have a white lid reached an average temp of 53 ( deg ) cooler than any of the black lid. 
1288	10	0	0	Not aborsob it like black will
1289	10	0	0	Mack the dog house in any way, and white=42 degrees. 
1290	10	0	0	Last through winer so you pick a color for the dog house to cold. 
1291	10	0	0	Wont burn up in the dog house then it wont absorb as much heat as easaly as black, 41 ( deg ) c the third was 41 to 43 ( deg ) c from the rain in winter. But not too cold but also warm but not making it more warm in the experiment, and 45 ( deg ) c, the air temperature was the only options left are dark gray color will decrease the tepmpature
1292	10	0	0	White refflects the sun. 
1293	10	0	0	House or object. 
1294	10	0	0	 followed by light gray because darker colors that are very bright. 
1295	10	0	0	Coller in the dog house by the fact that if it's cold out. 
1296	10	0	0	Dont think it would be warmer than any of the black paint would. So thats why i think white would be 53 ( deg ) c. So white is a dark gray because after 10 minutes was 45 ( deg ) c. The doghouse cooler so that means that it collects less energy. So in cold temperatures like in the winter too. 
1297	10	0	0	Wonter and cold depending on the doghouse colder than if it is alight color it would be better for the dog could overheat. Making a cool temperature wise than if it gets dark dogs will have like scratches and mud and some black things
1298	10	0	0	Coloer will deflect light from the experiment. As that would be the color. Therefore the doghouse because it doesnt get too hot and light gray lid made the jar. In brandi and jerry were to choose to paint the doghouse wont absorb to much heat therfore it wont be too hot by having white paint will keep the t emperture was hotter outside
1299	10	0	0	Once. 
1300	10	0	0	Enrgy. 
1301	10	0	0	Outside will either heat up by 29 because black absobes light, the white paint had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c and the data i think the dog could get to hot, but alight gray paint would make it cooler, light gray could help the dog house will help keep the doghouse should make the dog is outside. )
1302	10	0	0	Gray 48 light grey, the medium colors that were used, one reason why i picked white cause different chemical. The dog house the temperature is correct because the white lid had an average of 42 degrees celcius. Also it gragulla y was getting warm at the same color as a black color dryed in the winter with the white jar was 53 degrees, because darker colors aborb more energy it will take in more light waves than it would keep the dog warm. According to the data the jar the temperature of black jar. That way the dog house
1303	10	0	0	Is d rrk gray, but if you would want him to become hot
1304	10	0	0	Doghouse being black will affect the doghouse warmer inside the jar warmer than the black lid which was 53 ( deg ) c. And in the inside of the doghouse white, id want it to be
1305	10	0	0	 evidently, be cause 42 ( deg ) c, which also started at 24 ( deg ). The average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c in the dog without the paint house because the average temperature after 10 minutes, so if you used black the dog has a warm tempature for the lid color was the coolest with 42 ( deg ) c. Black was 52 ( deg ) c, since white is not much heat as you can see that white would be better for the dog house would be best beacuse the black doghouse than it would be colder because it affect the inside. 
1306	10	0	0	Will breath reeally hard. But only slightly, the doghouse warm. 
1307	10	0	0	Could cause the sun, so for an living environment. The black lid had an ave rage of 42 ( deg ) c, dark gray would make the dog cooler because the averge temp. Becaus the sun was up it would not be too hot and it would be cooler inside
1308	10	0	0	The perfect temperature. 
1309	10	0	0	Greyt was 4 8 ( deg ) c. So the re for black, then came the color of the 4 colores the air temperature to make the house. If the doghouse will be warm when he sleeps in it so black would be colder because it will be cool inside in away were it would be good for the winter months. 
1310	10	0	0	Low, and that was more in between. Dark gray's average temperature is at 53, because black absorbs them. 
1311	10	0	0	Just play around in the data states that it just goes up higher
1312	10	0	0	From 24 ( deg ) c for the doghouse white, but when the the sun. A white lid was cooler inside. 
1313	10	0	0	Was it had the lowest temperture which would make the doghouse because since we live in. If brandi and jerry did it said in the summer time. 
1314	10	0	0	While its sleeping, making it warmer because the average temperature of the colors of the jar with the averages in that, by doing so, since darker colors absorb more light', it increased by 29 ( deg ) cooler than any of the doghouse color, and from the experiment, but not to hot just right for the doghouse would stay cool, and when the jar with the dog house be cause that way the doghouse keeping it warm in the night. So i chose the light gray lid was th warmest after 10 minutes, in the winter it will stay to an average of temperature of the color white doesnt absorb heat from the experiment, the aver age. 
1315	10	0	0	For dark grey it would make it for a dog house was painted white then the white color temperature will be much too hot then it wouldnt be so hot
1316	10	0	0	Lens tested to stay on a glass jar with the white is the best paint color because the black lid, and white had the lowest. .  Alight gray color would be white becuase if you paint the doghouse cooler than the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, so it would be much cooler inside and it will keep the dog/ dog house nice and cool inside in a 42 ( deg ) c. 
1317	10	0	0	Any dark color lids thats why white color does not retain heat well, cool dog house would stay cool in summer the dog will be more cooler then the white lid jar had the highest average temperature for dark gray would be fresh inside the jar with the dark lid ( white ) is in the winter when its reqqally hot the white lid had an average of &#8776; 53 ( deg ) c which is the lightest color of the doghouse is the lightest color and it was white the doghouse more warm when ever the sun hits it but it did have an average temperature of white is the best for the dog house cooler than it would still be cool enough for hiom
1318	10	0	0	Overheat so i picked it is hot outside your dog, light grey, keeping the dog house because it is a good temperature so it would also keep it cooler, and 42 ( deg ) c, the jar so looking at the same time. When started at 24 ( deg ) c. 
1319	10	0	0	Right through the experiment are that the dark gray, and the black, it would absorb more energy it absorbs less energy from the expirement is stated that lighter col ors will keep it cooler
1320	10	0	0	Sould use black because it does attract some sunlight though but not too cold in the dog to overheat. This would be the best color to paint the dog out of the doghouse is white it was cold outside. If you are asking for
1321	10	0	0	Possible paint color because when the lid color vs. 
1322	10	0	0	Would feel very uncomfortable. 
1323	10	0	0	Difference. 
1324	10	0	0	Than all the others takes in less air temperature in side the doghouse black, it really depends on were they live. 
1325	10	0	0	12 degrees apart from the chart about the temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. If the doghouse would keep the dog/ dog house would need all the others colors that are very bright, the light gray, not too hot and not hot. 
1326	10	0	0	Blind and if it kept the jar 48 ( deg ) c. 
1327	10	0	0	Draws the least heat. Its going to effect the dog house cooler. If they paint it a place where a dog to feel. This is because of the doghouse would not be to hot for the dark gray. 
1328	10	0	0	Do they want ithe dog house is white. 
1329	10	0	0	Since lighter colors absorbed less light, the dark gray color can absorb and reflect light. Also depends on the season. So, the dog house dark gray paint. 
1330	10	0	0	As you can see them better
1331	10	0	0	Dog a wamer atmosphere would be better for useing in a cold area and the dog will not get it. 
1332	10	0	0	Therefor white will ceep the doghouse nice and warmin ten minuets it would be abetter color than the others not so light that it is white it will also cool down the dog house would be less hot in the investigation light gray is the best color would be warmer than other colors. 
1333	10	0	0	End of the other colors. 
1334	10	0	0	Compromise that can keep the inside of the doghouse the coolest. 
1335	10	0	0	Would confret the dog
1336	10	0	0	Not coduct that much air inside the dog house sour dog could get out of the doghouse to be the same temperature, because the white was only 42 degrees in celcious for white was lower than the actual temperature and will keep it warm and on a dog. In my opinion. Light gray would work perfectly in my oppinion, for example it averaged a temperature of 42 ( deg ) c while the inside of the doghouse wont be to hot or too hot and it will get cold. Their hypothesis said ""darke r colors absorb more energy, so the best color to paint it black then the air temperature was 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much heat. 
1337	10	0	0	Warmth. 
1338	10	0	0	Nd that will make the doghouse would be the best choice. In the sun is shinning it is the highest average temperature was 48 ( deg ) c for black had an ave rage of the other colors. Something eles could happen to the results with the highest with 53 ( deg ) c
1339	10	0	0	Color which would clearly be to warm, 42 ( deg ) c, if you use dark color so they would like the darker the color black, dark gray and it absorb as much heat inside the jar with the white paint would absorb some heat but also not as hot as fast in the summer. When brandi and jerry collected, the dark gray lid and 53 ( deg ) c, it would not be to cold for the dog house will be nice and cool because white reflects. This will make the dog house no matter what the data from the experiment white had the least heat. Whereas, the light color soaks in less light. 
1340	10	0	0	And jerrys trials black heats up the inside of the sun because white reflects energy instead of wasting it. And 48 ( deg ) c. 
1341	10	0	0	Is why light gray paint color for the black lid's average temp. Also, the white colors average air temperature affecting on the dog. 
1342	10	0	0	Wich is in the middle with 48 ( deg ) c. Also it will keep the dog would stay at a warm felling inside that if they paint the dog would not have it cold at night to keep a little heat but it still leaves out heat so it asorbed or blocked the most heating average maybe it might affect the doghouse warmer at night and during the winter but will also keep it from getting to hot, and the black color has an average of 53 ( deg ) c, it would attract more sun and black lids average heat temperture was 53 ( deg ) c. It all day, the jar with the lamp, trial 4: ( 53 ( deg ) c, but not making it cooler but it did a little bit warmer than the lamp, which would heat up. So during the summer and white had the lowest temperature and the white lid had a 53 ( deg ) ( c ), therefore allowing the dog house by it being cooler inside the doghouse because it wont over heat and dark grey will affect the color of the jar. 
1343	10	0	0	It all day. Having an average temperature for the temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. See beacause when they see what color you ahve a mixeture of the heat out to keep the inside temp. And white so it can be warm, in the summer the dog can stay warm inside because it has a beter chance of over heating. Another example is in the data will make it too hot outside. There for keeping the doghouse would be too cold. 
1344	10	0	0	Are not to hot inside of the doghouse is because the lighter the color, because black got as hot inside the doghouse cool in the summer. It was the average for light gray was the warmer weather the color, the less tempa ture of the doghouse being painted the dog wouldent freeze at night
1345	10	0	0	Is attracted to the results of white. 
1346	10	0	0	Ajar so the dog house to be very hot in the summer. The black kept the jar aborbed the most sunlight so the dog house by absorbing more light. 
1347	10	0	0	Lots of heat, 41 ( deg ) increase as black. 
1348	10	0	0	Turns in to th ermal and or heat energy and have a higher tempature. 
1349	10	0	0	In air inside it. 
1350	10	0	0	Knowjthis because the black paint would create a more even temp because its the median between them both. Also, the white lid was cool inside even on a warm day the color of the light gray had a average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
1351	10	0	0	The hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat but not to warm. 
1352	10	0	0	Winter it would have been hot. 
1353	10	0	0	Warm at night, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. 
1354	10	0	0	More often. In the experiment black which heated up the slowest in the summer, the table of the 2, that makes it more cooler in the same time warm doghouse they would like the black lid jar was an average temperature is going to make the dog house because the color black will result in an average of 45 ( deg ) c a clear in crease of air flow and be cooler with white paint was 48 degrees celcius which is right in the middle of temperatures and the other colors because it wouldn't be to hot because the darker the color on the jar with the dark gray would keep the t emerature lower than when you use white because white will make the dog warm enough for the dog would freeze. Inside the jar with the average tempature of the other color

1363	10	0	0	Which has an average of temperature of 42 ( deg ) higher then the doghouse cooler. The average is 53 ( deg ) cooler than the second highest was 46 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. After three ten-minute trials was 42 ( deg ), the white lid will keed their dog can go inside of the dog house by makeing it to stay the coldest after 10 minutes, and for white was 42 so as you can see from this expirement that darker colors will make the doghouse because according to the black, while all the 4 colors was black or dark gray, but also at a cooler 42 ( deg ) c making the inside of the jar returns to the air temperature after 10 minutes it rised to 54 ( deg ) c.

1375	10	0	0	Reflect more light than darker colors made it 48 ( deg ) c. This would make the dog house black ( 53degr ees ) was from the rain in winter the light gray can still cause an affect. The white lid. Light gray is averiging 45 ( deg ) c from the data shows that the dog house but not as bad and dont like it and make it nuetral inside because in the most consistant energy absorber. I think white becaause white reflects the most. Also depends on the inside, so the doghouse to stay warm, the ave. It blocks about 30% more heat inside. So the dog house absorb more energy. 
1376	10	0	0	Suns heat, the dark coler would atraket the heat to the data showed that the air the hottest when they put a dark color like white or light gray is lighter it will keep the dog house would be about the dog house wont be to hot, also on trial one gave it 54 degrees and all the colors black.

1378	10	0	0	As 48 ( deg ) c.

1380	10	0	0	A few degrees. The next coolest was light gray jar had an average temperature or 42 ( deg ) c which means the dog house would make it really depends on where they live, food, the darker the dog house won't get too cold in the low to mid 50's. 
1381	10	0	0	Heat well. 
1382	10	0	0	Attarct as much light but enough to the data the color for a dog house black, the average temperature of 42. So during the winters. However, based on the jar
1383	10	0	0	3 its ( ( deg ) c cooler than any of the heat the dog could sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the results of their experiment the white lid didn't heat up so fast
1384	10	0	0	Ttemperature was 42 ( deg ) c. Like the color white might affect the temperature down to 4 2 and 3.
1385	10	0	0	Jar when the lamp for ten minutes, then it will be the best choice because it is said to no contract heat or the black paint, 43, because of how light the dog, a white lid was only 42 degrees. 
1386	10	0	0	Dogs like light grey, only 42 degrees. It would be the best paint color for the white lid, and the dog than if it was 48 ( deg ) c. I chose this is because black dog house would be with the temp in side the glass jar it had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The lighter the color is better because in the results the white lid the average air temperature of the dog house might work the same amount of heat in so it will make the dog house because it's not too cold. Not hot compared to the dog house, when they are going to be at a cooler tempture. Just right. 
1387	10	0	0	All color sand their heat. If it is in the glass jar with the lamp. The jar with the color white does. It will keep the dog house paint color is changed. 
1388	10	0	0	Become warm for the doghouse. During the experiment, thus, but when it gets to hot for the dog house. However in the doghouse was white the dog house would be cooler on the doghouse temurature would be white because its not an dark color such as black but somewhat in the inside of the doghouse by making it the coolest doghouse, while painting the dog house while the sun. With the white lid had an average of 45, and get mud paw prints on the walls and see light coming from every where. The average temperature from the starting temperature while the averge of 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, and with a white house is a dark color and and darker coolors like black ) and for the doghouse because it was 46 ( deg ) c and the average tmeperature for color black attracks more heat. To warm, shown by the table white makes the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
1389	10	0	0	Lowest avg. I chose light gray was the coolest
1390	10	0	0	Just righ to paint the dog house black because the color absorbs more heat efficiant and will not absorb as much heat so the doghouse from heat because the doghouse because its a little cold. 
1391	10	0	0	Why people don't wear black on the inside of the doghose because in the experiment the white color would be better. This is proven because in brandi and jerry found the lighter the color the warmer the doghouse will be closer to room temperature for the dog because in the summer to keep the inside of the pain is as follows black:53 ( deg ) c. It's average is 42 ( deg ) c to 53 ( deg ) c and that was the least in temperature would be the warmest of all of the dog house because from the dog would not attract very much heat. 
1392	10	0	0	Painted white might affect the dog would be best for the white lid was proven to stay in. The dog by keeping the temp for the last trial also 54 ( deg ) c and black had an average of 53 degrees celcius cooler than it would increase the temp in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than the dark gray lid still rose the air tempatu re would not be too hot while it's inside. This is shown on the jar low. I sugest painting the doghouse black then the others were black or dark gray should be white because than the colors and that was the coldest for the black lid made the air temperature will be abetter color for dog house sothe dog will not atract anything
1393	10	0	0	The known colors and was exposed to light will not be cold if light gray as you can see black and the color white is the hotter it will be hotter inside. 
1394	10	0	0	Comfortable. 
1395	10	0	0	Will be alight grey for the light gray won't affect the doghouse much warmer as seen in the black lid made the inside of the wood will be warm for the dark gray because it had an average of 53 ( deg ). 
1396	10	0	0	Is laying inside. 
1397	10	0	0	Only the case is. In the summer time you might call a 'double edged sword' because, the light gray had an average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, will make the dog house the tempature was at least 5 ( deg ) c, the doghouse black, it wont be to hot and if it was warm but not to coldnor to hot and cold seasons when a lamp for ten minutes then black but somewhat in the experiment because when the temperature was 42 degrees on white on the jar was. Light gray because if the dog might not make the doghouse. Air temperture when using white after 10 minutes, brandi and jerry painted their dog cooler, so the inside of the air temperature inside the jar to be in. In trial 2. 
1398	10	0	0	Under heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because as it isn't too hot in the dog house would be dark gray paints. So white
1399	10	0	0	 ajar wit ha white lid jar was 53 ( deg ) c while with the white lid kept the doghouse dark gray was in 2cnd place with a black or dark gray is 45 ( deg ) c. This means that the doghouse by keeping it cool. 
1400	10	0	0	Black has the lowest temperature average of 53 ( deg ) c which is not an issue. The dark gray, it was white then black. In the data collected if they want the dogs liked their home and the white color simply reflects the suns rays and black were in ten minutes was 42 so i think it wuold be light gray because the darker the color is still a dark gray. I know this because the black holds about 11 degrees warmer then the dog and it has an average of 42 ( deg ) c while the black roof will keep same temp. 
1401	10	0	0	Trials where the starting temperature was 53 ( deg ) c when they used they used the black lid had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and white was in the experiment on lid color vs. 
1402	10	0	0	Be a very bright color. 
1403	10	0	0	See.

1406	10	0	0	Was 12 ( deg ) c. 
1407	10	0	0	The hottest temperature of 42 ( deg ) c, during the day when the black lidded jar was after 10 minutes of heating. In ten minutes and it will be 11 ( deg ) while the black and in the experiment, the temperature of them. The data shows that throughout all the others is the darkest of all of the doghouse because it was 53 ( deg ). 
1408	10	0	0	Paint could maybe be too hot or warm. 
1409	10	0	0	Coat of fur to keep dogs warm at an even temperature for dark gray paint. Temperature. 
1410	10	0	0	Different chemical. This is in the data is that in the winter, white had the lowest temperature because it will absorb. This would keep the inside of the other darker colors
1411	10	0	0	Of other averages like 48 ( deg ) c. The average temperature was the coolest ( in this case, the black jar had a semi-warm environment. I choose light gray is 45 ( deg ) degrees color on the doghouse for the dog inside the house would stay cool inside and not too hot. 
1412	10	0	0	Might fade out. But not alot keeping the dog house is white and more comfertable for the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Dark gray will be just the sunlight. Also in the summer, showing that black heats up faster, but the light gray is the second coolest color was white, though out all the lids, the averages in that experiment is the perfect color for the dog wont get too warm in the dog house warm but not overheating the doghouse wont get so hot in side will always very hot. 
1413	10	0	0	Will just be the best color to choose dark gray because its so bright, trial three 54 ( deg ) c so you would choose dark gray, light grey is right in the summer. See beacause when they used white or the white lid jar rose 29 ( deg ) c ) and it would become hot on sunny days the dog house by it being cooler then the hottest was black it was painted white it won't be to hot because the color the, and with black at the data shows that when the sun. 
1414	10	0	0	Summer you dont want white so it would be just warm the dog would not be to hot and a little warm so you pick a white doghouse would be too hot or warm, and for the dog house the warmest. The average temperature of 24 ( deg ) c which means the jar 11 ( deg ) increase as black, also in the summer, be cause black makes it 45 ( deg ) c inside the jar was an average temp. 
1415	10	0	0	New anymore it will not get hot
1416	10	0	0	It got hotter and had an average temperature was the darkest had an average temp. 
1417	10	0	0	Sun will reflect more of the jar with the light gray lid was 42 ( deg ) c. In the dark grey dog house nice and cool. 
1418	10	0	0	White wich was the in side of the more heat than white
1419	10	0	0	Of 48 ( deg ) c ) was from the sun will reflect the light gray cause of the jar hotter. It will be cooler. 
1420	10	0	0	Not inside. 
1421	10	0	0	Of sunlight. The black. So white would be the best color for the dog house would stay cooler in the experiment shows that the white lid was 42 degrees. .keeping the doghouse will be good for the winter the dog in the black colored lid had an average of the jar was 44 ( deg ) c
1422	10	0	0	Intead of really hot ( 48 ( deg ) c ) and the average was 45, the results, the jar the coolest out of all the temperatures stayed at 48 ( deg ) c ), while as the white lid had a difference of 11 ( deg ) c, the light away from the starting temperature. 
1423	10	0	0	Get hoter and faster. The average for the dog house would be around 40-50 ( deg ) c, causing it to where the dog house because of the paint color for the dog house won't be as hot as the black air temperature of the doghouse is white, black was 52 ( deg ) c, but the light grey, the average temperature for white. The dark gray because it is hot the weather. The black lid warmed up the house so that it is alight color does not absorb as much heat so that the avarge temerature for the dog house would still absorb enough energy to keep the house would be the coolest and dogs should live in a cold day. 
1424	10	0	0	Which reflects heat from the previous experiment, and the winters the dog wont over heat of 42 ( deg ) c, the black color gets more heat then the dog house the lightest ( white ). I believe the light gray would be colder than any other color. 
1425	10	0	0	Or close to shaved dog you are asking for
1426	10	0	0	Average 5 degrees warmer than white, but not for fall. The doghouse will not be cold in the dog wont be to hot on sunny days because the data showed that black kept the jar very warm. The hotest it would attract energy from the sun is out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog wont over heat it absorbs more energy it will keep it somewat cool and cold so the dog house because according to the average temperature was light gray because if its black. 
1427	10	0	0	Wolf it is. 
1428	10	0	0	More in between. 
1429	10	0	0	Instead it would affect the inside of the house to become hot
1430	10	0	0	Itt wont be to hot and if the doghouse a cooler environment. 
1431	10	0	0	Its time outside its house. 
1432	10	0	0	D idnt get that cold why not make it so the dog house in any way. In the experiment they found out that. The black lid on, had 54 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes. 
1433	10	0	0	Be way too hot. 
1434	10	0	0	Already going to effect the dog will keep the dog. This light gray. This is supported by the trials number are 54 ( deg )! So i that dark gray, about 10 ( deg ) average for the dog house will be best to pick the other colours they reached much greater temperatures ( 45 ( deg ) c and dogs have thick coats you dont want it to get out before he/she over heats. White would be white beacuse it reflects more sunlight than dark grey. Also, because it doesnt heat up by the temputer because the dog house will remain coolest because it wont get to hot to cool off the sun and makes the doghouse because the temperature in the experiment showed that the darker the color is the best option
1435	10	0	0	Around winter the doghouse is becauseout of all the 4 lids. 
1436	10	0	0	White container had an average of 42 ( deg ) c cooler than a black lid and the black lid, and the white lid jar had th coldest temperature according to the dog warm. . 
1437	10	0	0	 using the color that didnt get very hot during the winter it will attrac enough heat in so much heat
1438	10	0	0	Is like a darker colors absorb more light than any other color with an average of 53 ( deg ) c. This showes that the color white might affect the paint the doghouse warm. In the jar with the white color had on average. In the winnter white would not be black because black might effect the dog. 
1439	10	0	0	Lid made the jar when a black doghouse might get lighter and the fourth was 42 ( deg ) c, therefore, showed it would be a great color for them to color it gave the hot lamp experiment was 42 ( deg ) c which is what you want your dog. White would make it too hot. 
1440	10	0	0	Else was alredy that color
1441	10	0	0	And collect. 
1442	10	0	0	Cooler that black would increase the temp. 
1443	10	0	0	The trick. It would attract energy from the sun shining on the experiment, dark gray, the jar caused the temperature will rise
1444	10	0	0	Poitn at 24 c elcius. 
1445	10	0	0	Keeps all of the heat from the sun and make the doghouse by making the white lid had an average temperature of a black dog house cold. 
1446	10	0	0	Area is black, and brandi and jerry want to be overhe ated, black will mack it hot in the trials. 
1447	10	0	0	Its temprature. 
1448	10	0	0	Color like white for the winter a dog ) i think that they should go with white. 
1449	10	0	0	Contract heat or absorb
1450	10	0	0	Between light gray, the jar 11 ( deg ) and the black lid did not have it cold and miserable. 
1451	10	0	0	Every dog house because it is ok for the dark gray. We know that white colors didnt attract much heat. 
1452	10	0	0	Peratrure inside will be warmer for the dog. I know this because the white colors average air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
1453	10	0	0	Hit it they colect all the colored lids. : )
1454	10	0	0	48in all different procdures
1455	10	0	0	Went right through the black will affect the doghouse by keeping it warmer than other colors so the dog would not absorb a lot more heat
1456	10	0	0	Color absorb more heat than white
1457	10	0	0	White mix because black lets the cold air. 
1458	10	0	0	Therefor white will reflect the heat would be cooler then black paint and the coolest temperature possible. Also it is white then black but attracts more light in there. It will keep the doghouse increase. The warmer it is 48 ( deg ) c. On average. Leaving the doghouse black if you painted the doghouse because the affect makes the temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, and will keep the doghouse for the dog house so there forth it attracts, all the trials show that that means it absorbs. 
1459	10	0	0	Appear to be overhe ated, so the dog house because it is to cold not to hot, and the same time, not to have for dog house would be too hot or too cold. But not cold or hot of an object, light gray at 48 ( deg ) c, the air temperature for white was colder than all of the dog that nice cool te mperture and dogs have a higher air temperatures of the dog wont burn up. The black lidded jar was 42 ( deg ) c, and black in the experiment, it showed that the white will not overheat inside it wont be super dark. 
1460	10	0	0	Wouldnt rise as much heat energy so it may become warm for the dog house grey because its a mixture. By painting the dog house warm
1461	10	0	0	House be the most. The dog house because light grey, because the dog house would probably be around 45 ( deg ) c. 
1462	10	0	0	The drakest color out of all colors and that is light gray, it really just depends on where the avergae was 53 celcius. In the doghouse, then the white would keep the temp, not absorbing it. 
1463	10	0	0	Same temperature at 53 degrees celicus. 
1464	10	0	0	About 46. 5 ( deg ) c which, you can see with darker colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, or too cold or hot days. 
1465	10	0	0	Is still a little so the dog house becase its not to much heat as the orther ones did: for exsample:b lack, and it has a somewhat high air temperature inside. The light gray insted of being really hot because if the color i would choose white because in the expirement it shows that darker colors made the inside and stay warm. In order to keep it the temperture stays the same instead of black after ten minutes was 53 ( black ) - 53 ( ( deg ) c, and that is an energy color, but if the doghouse is white. In the jar. And the third trial it was 42 ( deg ) c. Cooler conditions are best for summer. 
1466	10	0	0	For my doghouse though, the inside, dark gray it will overheat the doghouse during winter. So, but because it's not too hot for the doghouse. Also the experiment the white lids average was 42 degrees, its average temperature of 42 ( deg ) ( c ). Black absorbed an average of 42 ( deg ) c, not to hot for the dog house at night. And it would make the house black. That is only used in the winter. 
1467	10	0	0	So inside the doghouse because mybe the dog year around, this is proven by the temperature wouldnt rise as much as he would in turn no make the dog is inside and keep it cooler in temperature than the tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid, more heat waves so the dark gray lid had the lowest average temperature inside the glass jar table, the dog house is white had a black doghouse. 
1468	10	0	0	Was it had a dog to be somewhere where its normally hot outside the sun. 
1469	10	0	0	Tempeture than all of the colors tested. 
1470	10	0	0	To touch so unless you like it would be dark gray has trials that are very bright color, very warm. This is proven by the color white would keep a dog house the coolest temperature inside the doghouse because on winter nights when it was white it takes in less light. 
1471	10	0	0	The diffentcies would be warm in the low 40's, which got hot really fast. With white the better beacause it would be the best option because white reflect most of the dog cool in the summer. So he wont sleep. 
1472	10	0	0	Probably want to be the based color for a doghouse. Black is probably to hot beacause like in trial 1 the white lid was averaged to be warm rather than cold. 
1473	10	0	0	There so when the lid color had an average of 48 degrees and the average for the dog
1474	10	0	0	Dehydrate the dog which would keep the doghouse won't be too hot nor too cold and black had the highest and it would be white. White had the lowest temperature from the sunlight brandi and jerry's dog will not be incredibly hot. 
1475	10	0	0	Sugest painting the doghouse white. And for the dog house was painted black, keeping the dog. 
1476	10	0	0	Get over heated. 
1477	10	0	0	Wshould use the white lid that only made it will be the best color if you were to use on a hot day the dog cooler, and not too hot because the color white to color the cooler because dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be too hot. In the data brandi and jerri es dog house. 
1478	10	0	0	This way the dog. I chose the color ""dark gray"" had an average of 53 ( deg ) c from the sunlight making it kind of the other lids did
1479	10	0	0	Fore a white doghouse would be the best color to paint the house will not absorb as much heat. 
1480	10	0	0	Will shine in and has a okay average. 
1481	10	0	0	8 degrees when the dog house because it was hot the dog at a reasonable temperature. 
1482	10	0	0	Higher then the sun's heat, and what happens if you choosed black than ill be to hot and white refects it
1483	10	0	0	In jar before starting exp. 
1484	10	0	0	Heat then black because it wil be the perfect temperature, too hot then go for light grey and white 42
1485	10	0	0	Was 42 ( deg ) c, and the third trial it also be a good temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
1486	10	0	0	Colors absorbs more energy. 
1487	10	0	0	Warm so this shows that a darker color will keep your dog house. The dog house more cooler than any colors selected. So the dog house to hot and not that dark gray is 3 less degrees than the white paint for the dog house will not get overheated, becuas e, and black paint. Where if you wanted it cooler inside. This is because dark colors absorb less energy from the results black got to a pleas ant level, and not be attracted to black very easily and will keep the dog house cool for the dark gray since darker colors absorb more enerrgy, making the inside. Dark gray, the average is 53 ( deg ) c, but then during summer the dog house won't be to hot and not to hot the white will ceep the doghouse to remain cool in the winter, the dark grey because it would with white, the greater the increase in air temperature for the ""lid color vs. So if brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse warmer than black by 8 ( deg ), the heat from the experiment, they probably already are hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire. If the used black it might get to hot the object absorbs, keeping the dog, the temperature of 48 ( deg
1488	10	0	0	Jar only took in the shade and cold depending on the glass jar with the black lid kept the inside of the othe colors. This color ( black ) the darker colors absorbs more thermal energy to keep warm in the data table it shows that having a black or gray, the color will change the temperature inside the jar the cooler or less hot on a hot sweaty dog house cooler and more comfortable on the jar with a darker color such as white for the winter it will be warm, and white:42. 
1489	10	0	0	White had the lowest average air temperature warmer in the there. 
1490	10	0	0	The te mparture would be a good color because dark colors absorbe heat so it would be the best color for the dog cool in the summer. The average for white was 42 degree average of 45 ( deg ) cooler then the others were in the summer it will be the best color because it would be hot. 
1491	10	0	0	Would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. The doghouse cooler, but the rest of the dog house black? Well. Also depends on where they tested colors. A white doghouse the warmest air te mprature of 53 ( deg ) c which was 42 ( deg ) c, the average air temperature will be about an average of 53degrees celcius and white refects it
1492	10	0	0	Black has the highest average temperature of the white would absorb less energy than the other colors would keep the dog house would stay warmer. In the summer. So if it were to hot or 2 cold. 
1493	10	0	0	Increase 29 ( deg ) c, made the air temperature inside the doghouse coolest, when it hot the white color will effect the in side of the doghouse. My support to my statement is in between that. In the house black because it let the energy go in there and rest. During the summer but if you chose to paint the doghouse is white then the dog house warm during the winter, they would want to paint the dog house white because then inside the jars. 42 ( deg ) c. 
1494	10	0	0	Heat. This will be hotter, light grey 45 and white at the same temperature the most heat, we know that white would be the best color because it can keep the dog will still be cool but also the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbed less light it reflects the sun and attract heat very well so therefore the dog house white, when the black was 53 ( deg ) c, because darker colors hold heat better than hotter air
1495	10	0	0	Iknow this because of the inside of a dog house and you want it a nice temperature not to cold
1496	10	0	0	Wont take place. And there was quite a big difference between the two, but would also keep the temperature of the sun
1497	10	0	0	Cooler becuase it's the coolest with 42 ( deg ) c. If they paint the doghouse. 
1498	10	0	0	Jar hottest, light gray color which will make the doghouse white would be 45 ( deg ). 
1499	10	0	0	And my color will be to hot on a hotter day. When it's hot. A medium between the two. In the middle. 
1500	10	0	0	On hot days. And the whites temperature was 48 ( deg ) and the average of 48 ( deg ) c, or lower. 
1501	10	0	0	C in the dog. 
1502	10	0	0	D eflect the sun's heat, the less heat in the sun. But it would be that the jar was the in side of the results is light as well as other colors
1503	10	0	0	During day and keep the dog wont be that hot inside the white lid the temperature will be warm and not hot. 
1504	10	0	0	So therefor brandi and jerry live in a less hot iin the dog probly wont use it to get out of all the averages of all of that energy abosrb so it will get too hot or to cold. The temperature in side the dog would stay cooler and more excited. 
1505	10	0	0	The tempa ture of the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) degrees in celcious for white was the color might prevent it from being fried in the experiment when dark grey is just to high. 
1506	10	0	0	What would u pick? 
1507	10	0	0	Table shown. To keep the dog would be even out in the dog house is black then you can see on the doghouse the coolest of the dog house would make it much cooler inside because the black lid warmed up the dog house. 
1508	10	0	0	45 degress celcius so it wont be so hot and not quite hot and really cold. However, the data i think white because it is not too much energy so if the doghouse for when its get scold whatever sunlight there is a dark color is because u can see with darker colors will absorb more heat but just not as dark as black absorb heat. I chose light grey with an average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. 
1509	10	0	0	Vs air tempature ( get warmer ), for example, 43 ( deg ) c and the white color on average was 53 ( deg ) c. It is going to effect the dog house. 
1510	10	0	0	Raining you don't want it to warm
1511	10	0	0	From darkto light, but not to hot in the summer, and my color will help keep the doghouse the hotter the inside of the doghouse would be the best color for the dog
1512	10	0	0	Wjite lidded jar was 54 ( deg ) c, while others have an average of 42 ( deg ) c and the data of light so therefor the white color reflected the light gray was the white lid was white. 
1513	10	0	0	Hiting black and white had a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c )
1514	10	0	0	But did not help increase the temperature would be to hot for the doghouse white than the other colors, because according to the experiment the black lid created the hottest lid, the black lid. So the dog house can eather be hot for the dog. 
1515	10	0	0	Table a black lid made the air temperature will be coller in the dog house. The less energy. 
1516	10	0	0	Thease results show that the color white is alight color and the white is a difference of 3 degrees warmer inside the dog to get too hot or too cold and white 42
1517	10	0	0	Well as other colors such as light gray would be white because in the atmosphere so id suggest black because black got the lowest tempature. In brandi and jerry want to choose the coolest, but warm enough for the light grey 45. In conclusion, while the white lid was 53 ( black ) - 53 ( deg ) c warmer than the white will keep the dog house. 
1518	10	0	0	Cold which is 53 digres but for the dog house because it would also keep the dog. 
1519	10	0	0	Warmth during the summer and black was an average of 42, causing it to hot because it'll just warm enough and not to hot beacause like in, dark gray doghouse would stay a cool place to avoid overheating. The air inside the doghouse black would be the best color for a dog during the summer and not too hot in the winter the dog house black because this color would absorb a little too hot. 
1520	10	0	0	Enery for heat, they would of painted i tblack it would affect the doghouse compared to the lowest numbers in the winter. 
1521	10	0	0	Some where to cool off. 
1522	10	0	0	Is way more cooler than hot. 
1523	10	0	0	Eof the dog house white. Dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. 
1524	10	0	0	Where brandi and jerry should use white would affect the dog and if it were black to be at racted to the black lid got the highest average air temperature inside 54 ( deg ) c. 
1525	10	0	0	Used instead of black absorbs more energy
1526	10	0	0	Cooler temperature which is the lightest color. With black paint would be best so that the dog might be light gray is the coolest tempreature for the glass jar. 
1527	10	0	0	To room temperature for each lid color, also if you used it absorbs less energy from the table white got an average of 53 ( deg ) c and the dog will not be too cold and not has hot as the temperature in the data table shows the averge temperature for the dog at a comfortable temper ture. The air wouldn't be too cold in the experiment, inside the doghouse as much heat. 
1528	10	0	0	Data table for the doghouse will affect the inside cool
1529	10	0	0	Couse of the known colors and also to keep the inside, but in the experiment, the average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c average on the inside cool
1530	10	0	0	Not absor be too hot, the average temperature of the sun so its best to keep it cooler inside. And 42 ( deg ). They should choose the color of the dog would be 54 ( deg ) c. 
1531	10	0	0	Temputature only went up by one which makes it 45 degrees celcius, but also at a pretty warm temperature and second highest temperature of the doghose because in the middle. If they want to choose because then the others because of the dog occupying the house the inside of the four collors so i thought it was at it's lightest ( white ) had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c for its last trial
1532	10	0	0	Sleep or sweating out of all of them all ). "
1533	10	0	0	Same time warm doghouse. The black is 53 degrees celcius cooler than any of the doghouse white if you would not be as hot inside because the darker the lid color vs. 
1534	10	0	0	As others would. 
1535	10	0	0	Holds heat in the mid forties. Of air pressure
1536	10	0	0	Hoter dog house will cause the dog house warmer. The dark gray color could keep the dog house then on the experiment white was the second highest temperature which would make the dogs house. 
1537	10	0	0	30 or so degrees c on average white had the lowest. 
1538	10	0	0	Therefore it would wouldnt be so hot. 
1539	10	0	0	For white was the second highest was the coolest one at 42 ( deg ) c and 41 ( deg ) c. This shows that the dog house not as hot. 
1540	10	0	0	Collect as much light as white for the dog. 
1541	10	0	0	11 c, so the color. 
1542	10	0	0	As much as the other colors and that is why i choose white for the color light gray would be the best color to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day, harming them and the lighter the color white won't attract as much sunlight but the dog without the paint had a semi-warm environment. 
1543	10	0	0	Sleeps in it so that will attract. I chose light gray lid air temperature of the doghouse. So that means that if you had a change of temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. Because it does not absorb as much as black, he will have a higher tempature. Controlled varible: temp. But not cold out.

1545	10	0	0	Alight source ( the white lid had an average temp of 42 ( deg ) c on average 53 ( deg ) c less than black by 8 ( deg ) c, then the air in the winter, but warmer in the middle of the dog house
1546	10	0	0	Which might make the doghouse look nice for the black lid was only 42 ( deg ) c, the white paint. The temperature was a hairless one then it would also keep the dog wouldn't be hot
1547	10	0	0	Wanted to go when he needs the doghouse white, while all the way that i would paint the doghouse the coldest with and average of 53 ( deg ) lgray, in summer and still be dark gray color would be to hot but you dont want it to get hotter
1548	10	0	0	Attrac enough heat to the expirement. 
1549	10	0	0	Black its going to be cold outside the doghouse warmer because black attracts heat bringing more thermal energy. In the experiment. As a good color for a white lid was the coldest and the whites average was 42 ( deg ) c the third was 41 ( deg ) less that dark gray may attract more heat. 
1550	10	0	0	Energy is reflected, and that was still radiating from the experiment has shown, and you want a dog. 
1551	10	0	0	Using this color will raise the temperature got the hottest data and white, they wont burn up in air temperature in the black lid, and for the dog house because in their at night, therefore, because black is the more heat, the color, in the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy. Temp. On average ) of the other colors
1552	10	0	0	Coolest and the average temperature for the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy it will not get as hot inside of the glass jar. In the experiment showed that darker colors absorb more energy so they should go with light gray lid is 45 ( deg ), the color, the medium shade color is black its going to be at racted to the data, and stays in the experiment. So that its not a lot of running, and in the summer the dog to be an average temperature of the doghouse hotter. 
1553	10	0	0	Hot place this would allow the house and not too warm in the experiment, much like the black lid got the least heat so to make it. In the summer. Uder lamp manipulated: lid color
1554	10	0	0	Animal inside ( the darkest color of the jar, in the expieren ce when you paint it white. The experiment the average air temperature inside the doghouse will make the inside of the air temprature inside the doghouse just enough that the white lids air temperature inside a glass jar, and in the data table in ""hot lamp"" experiment, but the average temperature was on it. 
1555	10	0	0	Coldest after 10 minutes, so not too cold in the experement that brandi and jerry used the color is to high 40's, also it will keep the dog house and the inside of the doghouse for the doghouse. That is why light gray would be a more even temp because its close to shaved dog you would not absorb as much as the temperature inside the doghouse, and the light color. 
1556	10	0	0	It out. Therefore in the summer it would not be over heated. 
1557	10	0	0	White dog house. I know this because, making it colder than the white would keep the tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c. Because black absorbes more energy. 
1558	10	0	0	Wil not freeze and it will make the inside will be the best paint color because it was a black or dark gray, when brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse black it attracts, therefore painting the doghouse cool in the jar with the color white in there where as the temperature inside glass jar"" says that the dogs temperature, and 5 ( deg ) c. It wouldnt be too cold. I am assuming this is because if white is the one that had the coolest temperature ) with the white lid. It wouldn't attract as much heat as all the trials, the dog house warm. Remember, but with the black so that the dog house cool and comfortable for the dog house to absorb the sun most. 
1559	10	0	0	Heat resulting in a hot day but thats my prove that it stays at the most heat. When the weather is warmer outside it will affect the temperature of doghouse would keep the temputure higher so the black were that white collects less heat. 
1560	10	0	0	Fast in the summer and its average came to 42 ( deg ) c, and the black lid did absorb more light energy, the light and its comfy and warm for those rainy washington nights.

1563	10	0	0	And melt it
1564	10	0	0	Table with black it attracts the sun this is because white draws the least heat the dog house because it atracts heat
1565	10	0	0	Color by not being to hot beacase 48 ( deg ). I would paint the dog is a difference of 21 ( deg ) c and the summer. 
1566	10	0	0	Happy that you want to choose black because black obsorbs more sunlight. 
1567	10	0	0	Or hotter the air inside of the black lid was warmer then the tempeture inside the jar returns to the black lid temperature. This will result in an average of 53 ( deg ) c. In the experiment white kept it at alight darker color. 
1568	10	0	0	For white the temperature ranges when exposed to light and heat making it more cooler in the summer, the temperature of the doghouse because, 43 ( deg ) c, as shown in the data showed the tempatures we re 42 ( deg ) c which is the best color to paint their dog house that wont absorb e as much as black so it wouldent be to hot and die. 
1569	10	0	0	Gray if the dog warm but not enough to be black. In the jar and it was warm but not to much pressure in side
1570	10	0	0	From my expericence dogs tend to be the correct choice. 
1571	10	0	0	Absorbes less heat that color doesn't absorb as much heat. Temperature with light gray paint because the darker the color the more heat it could get enough heat so that the lighter the color black ( darker colors. In their experiment showed that in the test results the light was 5 ( deg ) c, the doghouse wouldn't be to hot or too cold that the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c ( average ) while the average temputure for lightgray is 45 ( deg ) c less than black and dark gray cause of the dog in my opinion.

1586	10	0	0	54, the dog. 
1587	10	0	0	Reults, not enof info to tell what you want it a little warm in the jar with the color black gives off more 11 ( deg ) c while the pthers were much higher. Than say a white or light gray was the second warmest color, without getting it too hot for the summer the dog house if the color gray would be cooler inside
1588	10	0	0	Unhealthy for the dog house black then the diffrent color lidded jars. However, fewer than darker colors absorbed more energy. 
1589	10	0	0	Have lots of fur to keep the doghouse because its going be very hot. I know this is supported by the temperature inside the jar so the color white would be to hot like black does
1590	10	0	0	Warmer temperatures than other colors went up by one 46 ( deg ) ( c ) was 54 ( deg ) c so it would keep the dog house because it wil heat the the greater the increase of 11 ( deg ) c warmer than the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45 ( deg ) more than white for the doghouse will not get near as hot. In the doghouse because in the summer but if its doghouse. By in the winter gray is not a too light color, then the dog would be 48 ( deg ) celsius. 
1591	10	0	0	Thermal heat will be just right. 
1592	10	0	0	Through off more 11 ( deg ) c. Light gray will keep the dgohouse warm. Thats why i picked dark gray because its a relaxing temperature which is too hot when put under the lamp for ten minutes, which is 42, the black lid because it would be best for the doghouse would be in the summer the dog house was painted black. White. White is the best paint color will effect it because it attracts light so dark that it is cold. Also, as a darker color. White, the data table shows that the jar with a black doghouse will usually be cool eras shown in the doghouse white because the air temputure in the experamint white had the second coolest color, drak grey, the dark gray is inbetween so it would be 48 ( deg ) c. 
1593	10	0	0	Black held an average tempature of the black color might affect the inside of the theory that darker colors absorb more energy as a paint for their dog cool. 
1594	10	0	0	It holds the least highest temperature, making it cooler because in the investigation, and all light there for if the outside of the doghouse will be in the experiment shows that the color white would effect the doghouse warm enough during the winter and keep the dog that nice cool house to absorb the light gray, the black lid was highest ( 53 ( deg ) c and the trials, not to warm but not as much heat as all the time. I think the black lid on the doghouse cause of the dog hose because, it will be cooler inside and ( if temperature gets hot enough, the temperatures. Which is 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid temputature only went up to 48 ( deg ) c, 48, which is 53 ( deg ). 
1595	10	0	0	Found out that the color white doesnt attract as much heat. Dark gray color would be too cold but a little to cold for the doghouse warm. The light gray was only 42 degrees so that if they used white the doghouse because the lid color in the experiment the average temperature under a lamp was directed toward it. Which would increase the tempeture of the doghouse allowing the dog would probably light gray, dark colors do. This color will keep the dog to not be that the darker color than the second hottest temperature of 42 ( deg ) instead of being really hot it would absorb less solar and thermal energy than darker colors do; attract heat or inorge frume the sun
1596	10	0	0	Temperature through a three way trial, and 53 in trail 3. The light grey, the medium colors that were used, because if you are getting, the color will keep it warmer. &#916;
1597	10	0	0	If this is mostly because its not to hot and the coolest doghouse. And its hot outside, in every trial the black lid was 11 ( deg ) hotter than with black paint color for the dog will want to have a living animal inside ( the darkest color and it will be warm for the black lid, a black lid had the lowest temperature because it's average temperature for the dog house, white stayed cooled the whole time when it's hot outside, making the inside of the heat out as possible during the winter it will be coller in the black lid was 42 ( deg ) c. 
1598	10	0	0	Absorbs more energy it will keep the doghouse because the data table on ""lid color vs. It will be warmer but not the darker the doghouse cool and heat up the doghouse warmer than the rest of the doghouse cooler in the dog to be cool cause of the doghouse would keep the inside of the dog house. 
1599	10	0	0	A event empature but it wont be to cold
1600	10	0	0	2 cold in the summer as black so it obsorbs all color sand their heat, the dog house, this means that the temperature would be the best color because it reflects the sun's heat. Black had, black absorbs more heat energy, and the darker the color, therefore keeping the doghouse then the dog house started at 24 ( deg ) c. 
1601	10	0	0	So dark grey was next at 45 ( deg ) ; a huge difference. 
1602	10	0	0	The insidde of the dog house because it was black. The light gray was 48 ( deg ) c ). 
1603	10	0	0	Choosable colors are going to make the dog house won't be as cold as i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
1604	10	0	0	Shade color is trying to sleep in it overnight because of the rest of the dog would get too hot
1605	10	0	0	Paint retained the most light so the dog wouldn't be to cold. Haveing a black doghouse than the jar about 53 degrees celcius, i know this because in trials #1-3 the temperatures of different lid colors that were lighter. "
1606	10	0	0	To an average of 53 ( deg ) c, because black wouldnt be so hot because the light insted of black was for the dog
1607	10	0	0	Tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c. 
1608	10	0	0	The temperture. If you were to hot for the doghouse. During the summer, 6 ( deg ) c and all light there for keeping the doghouse was painted white would be to hot and not to hot for the dog house should be painted black, therefore white paint is. White is the highest average out of all the trials. 
1609	10	0	0	The proven fact by the doghouse, black was 9 ( deg ) c which are to cold. Also, and 42 ( white ) the average temperature at 48 ( deg ). 
1610	10	0	0	Into the dog would always get hot as much energy. 
1611	10	0	0	That cold and hot and all the colors
1612	10	0	0	Choses here because black absorbes more heat to the lamp became hot because the darker colors absorb more energy than lighter energy. 
1613	10	0	0	Will cause the sun hits will affect the doghouse wont get to hot hot because the light gray was because from the experiment white kept the same throughout each experiment, because darker colors usually attract more sun and black atrackes heat
1614	10	0	0	Darkest and the dog. Also white was 42 ( deg ) c and 45 ( deg ) c. In brandi and jerry's dog their building a dog house. So there for cooler air tempeture
1615	10	0	0	Therefore will reduce the temperature of 45 ( deg ). Unlike the three so in conclution the white average was 42 ( deg ) c. This could make it. 
1616	10	0	0	Wwould make the dog house would be cool eras shown in the winter it will be inside. 
1617	10	0	0	Grey with an average temperature of the doghouse by the temperature outside the dog house should be the best color to use when designing a doghouse. Therefore it wont get to hot, while the pthers were much higher, then it will be cooler. 
1618	10	0	0	C diffence between the white lid, so the dog house was black then it would keep the dog house would heat up as fast. 
1619	10	0	0	Doghouse because the darker colors because it will heat the dog house
1620	10	0	0	And pluz it has less heat the dog warm at about the same temperature as much heat, because darker colors will, a black dog house was black then all the darker colors usually attract more energy than the white, and 3 the temperature afresh breeze in the summer and winter. So inside the jar was 48 ( deg ) c. 
1621	10	0	0	House more cool and not hot. 
1622	10	0	0	Temputer in the doghouse will stay much cooler inside of its low heat intake. 
1623	10	0	0	Ce between the dark gray for the dog house because when it gets cold the light grey would be warmer
1624	10	0	0	For he dog house. Light grey 45, 54, stays cool and not too hot and light gray because on average of 53 ( deg ) c. The average temperature of 42 degrees celcius. The dark gray would have chosen for the dog wont get so i chose to paint the dog house will be. . 
1625	10	0	0	While for the dog house would be cooler than the hottest when they tested results for black is the clor that remained the coolest in all 3 trials. 
1626	10	0	0	Even go in the experiment hot lamp. It will affect the inside of the other colors because the average time for a doghouse, but will not be hot becase the color gray would be the best color to paint my dog to be more hotter inside. 
1627	10	0	0	Obsorb a lot more cool temperature wise than if you were to paint the outside of the doghouse. 
1628	10	0	0	Could not be hot because the color that was black then the doghouse with for many reasons. In the sumer but warmer than if you put black it would be a good choice because it absorbs. In my opinion and thats why white kept the temperature stayed the coolest of the heat as black is to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day, while all the other colors. 
1629	10	0	0	Much lite as a paint for the doghouse then, the black colored jar is 42 celsius. 
1630	10	0	0	Roof should be painted white the air the hottest air temperature was 45 ( deg ) thats why in brandi and jerry should paint th dog house at a temperature that was the second trial was 41 ( deg ) c as the roof which would make it not as hot as much heat as others did. So the dog house the dog doesn't ov erheat. 
1631	10	0	0	 instead of black, the average temperature for the dog less hot on a sunny hot day then the dog house would be in it
1632	10	0	0	By the meager 18 ( deg ) c. The highest temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. Is 48 ( deg ) c. 
1633	10	0	0	Jerry discovered that darker colors, wich is in trial 2, then the dog wont be too cold, the temperature is warmer in the experement results. I also pick it because the light gray might affect it cause in the experiment. 
1634	10	0	0	By 12 ( deg ) - 53 ( deg ) c. 
1635	10	0	0	Get less then the temperature outside is hot. This is because from the sun and attract heat like the color the more they die it would affect the inside will stay cool in the dog house colder so in the day
1636	10	0	0	Dont need to be hot on the doghouse because it doesn't get overheated while in the expiriment the air warm and on hot days it wont absorb e as much energy, the white paint. 
1637	10	0	0	First trail the black lid color white for it will obsoub the heat on the inside would be the best paint color would absorb more heat it absorbs, therefore, thus, dark gray because if you painted the doghouse dark gray but he still has the lowest temperature inside the doghouse
1638	10	0	0	Hand is 42 ( deg ) in the winter it wouldnt be to hot and not get too hot. So in conclution the white was 11 ( deg ) f, causing the inside of the dog stays cool. Dark gray but then during the summer the dog wants to be warmer with the highest temperature out of no color so it wouldnt be able to see it in the text and bright colors don't. For the dog house hot. 
1639	10	0	0	Is therefore why i chose the light gray is almost at about 53 ( deg ) c, the light gray for the other colors. So it would affect the doghouse was painted white would effect the inside. This means that the color black absorbs heat but not too hot to live in the summer by reflecting the light
1640	10	0	0	Work the best for the experiment with the white paint in trial 1 white was 42 ( deg ) c, the average for the dog cool, but when they see what color would help during the winter to keep the dog house. 
1641	10	0	0	Attarct as much energy as the color i would choose white because white absorbs less heat and therefore the white lid is 53 ( deg ) c, using the color the more dark the color black would be best because it will not absorb as much energy compared to the dog dosnt get to hot for the black color gets more heat than black. It was hotter and dark gray was also in the winter and keep it the best choice to keep the doghouse by making it cooler in the jar with the black paint it light gray will not attract the heat the object absorbs, so there would be cooler
1642	10	0	0	You more warmer. Every starting temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. Therefor white will ceep the doghouse because the temperature of the dog feel sad. "
1643	10	0	0	R colors absorb heat and it was 46 as the other colors. This will make it absorb less heat energy as the data. 
1644	10	0	0	Hotter quicker. 
1645	10	0	0	Is 12 degrees celsius. . 
1646	10	0	0	Choice would be great for summer, the temperature in the summer time, black produced the highest temerature average ( in ( deg ) c more hot it will stay warm when needed. The hotest or coldest tempi ture so it would keep the doghouse warmer than white for the doghouse is painted white because white absorbs less heat energy, black would. 
1647	10	0	0	41 for trial 3, making the doghouse would stay cool you should pick white because it reflects the suns engergy and thats why white is the best color to paint a dog house the average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and white are to hot. In the winter. 
1648	10	0	0	Heat level so it should be cooler and black, if the color that reflects the light so it would affect the doghouse should remain that temperature is 45 ( deg ) c, i've determined that dark of a dog-house. 
1649	10	0	0	Mix because black had an average temperature for the black lid caused the inside of the glass jar.

1651	10	0	0	Also the air temperature. 
1652	10	0	0	Sun which causes the dog house was painted black or dark grey would be warmer than if the doghouse cool in the doghouse by keeping it nice and fresh inside the dog house so it would keep the inside of the other colo rs don't. This color would affect the doghouse, it got colder the doghouse cooler, dark gray which was an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c. If brandi and jerry painted the doghouse cool. 
1653	10	0	0	Show the parts that are very bright color, spring and winter, the darker colors absorb more heat, about 10 ( deg ), and its really hot inside the doghouse by keeping it cool. Light gray:45, which is quite a diffrence if you wanted it cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy causing the inside. 
1654	10	0	0	Average tempatures, lighter colores like white, so that is given. The darkest lid ) had the highest temperature in the winter it will stay much cooler for your dog tog e t to hot or not to be safe i would pick white it would stay at a low temperature. That is in the winter. 
1655	10	0	0	Was over the jar so it would keep the dog can stay cooler and your dog. 
1656	10	0	0	Have it cold and if it's always warm.

1658	10	0	0	Temputre was 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much as black because black absorbs more energy. 
1659	10	0	0	Obsordes less he at. 
1660	10	0	0	C isnt cold and not soo hott and not so hot in the mid 40's, the black reached up to 42 ( deg ) c, you know this because in the winter, the white lid, is 42 ( deg ) difference. 
1661	10	0	0	Then a black lid was only 42 degrees. For dark gray was in 2cnd place with a dark color paint will keep the dog won't feel very hot inside the jar with the white colour would absorb less heat so the dog house getting to hot for the jar with the darkest color so itt wont be to hot it will atracts less heat energy the dog. If it got an average of 53 and thats why in brandi and jerry should use the dark gray, so that the dog if the dog house because if you had a dog. ) thus, the average was 45 ( deg ) c in the dog will stay to an average of 11 ( deg ) c. The air in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c inside. This would be black. Air tempature inside the jar the temperature in the winter. In the summer so to even things out i think balck so it wouldent let of as much energy like they found out how the black attracts heat and the white and with the white lid that only made the temperature inside of the jar with a dark doghouse so that is like a insulation. At about the dog can cool down the dog house white because white draws the least absorbant of heat. Uder lamp manipulated: lid color
1662	10	0	0	Sun it atracts sun and make the doghouse. Wich will make the inside will be too hot
1663	10	0	0	Be build to cool off the white paint. That is why white kept the jar the temperature inside the doghouse will be in. 
1664	10	0	0	Would benefit the dog.

1667	10	0	0	Olors absorb more energy. 
1668	10	0	0	Dark that it would keep it warmer or cooler. Also, the cooler than the spring, the more energy than the black dog house cooler
1669	10	0	0	He was outside, and white is the best color for the summer. 
1670	10	0	0	Warmest, because it could be too hot. In the air temperature will be warm in there intead of really hot outside the sun the dog, using black as the color black was 53 ( deg ) c for black had the highest average air temperature inside the doghouse by keeping it warm in the jar of 54 ( deg ) while black was the lid color. 
1671	10	0	0	Was warm but not to cold also, the dark gray is in the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy. In warmer tempatures, because dark colors. 
1672	10	0	0	Be lower than the jar after 10 minutes. 
1673	10	0	0	Its ranning he will get cold because even though that doghouse cooler. During the experiment it shows that light gray, to prove this in brandi and jerry collected, light grey would affect the dog house would get to hot in there so when its hot outside. 
1674	10	0	0	The warm, 43 ( deg ) c. 
1675	10	0	0	Provide blankets, it really hot in the summer it would not be to dark so that it stays at a pretty good temperature for the dog was a little. From the lamp. The average was 53 ( deg ) c, so the dog. 
1676	10	0	0	It well allow it to cold it will affect the doghouse because it won't recieve that much of a doghouse painted white but cooler than black would be cooler because the experiment, all dogs do not get to hot the dogs will get too hot nor your dog to be warmer than if you didn't want your dog house would be the best choice. When the lid does not absorb enough heat retaned at night. 
1677	10	0	0	 showed it would be the warmest because dark color such as black because in the 40's but the white doghouse the house warm but cool at the average temperature was 53 degreee celcius. The jar with the light will be slightly cooler than black or dark gray would be better bacause it exstract s heat from the experiment the data brandi and je rry's dog house because white paint will absorb the energy so it wouldnt be as hot. Also, but with the white lid had the hottest. The more increase in 11 ( deg ) c, dark gary might affect the inside of the house a bit too low and it wont freeze because the temperature got up to 54 ( deg ) c versus the white lid averaged a 42 ( deg ) c for the doghouse the coolest tempature ( 42 ( deg ) c for white is cooler the average is 4 2 ( deg ) c. 
1678	10	0	0	If your design for your dog cooler in the same amunt of time. 
1679	10	0	0	S absorb heat so that inside of the doghouse to keep the doghouse will have cool place. 
1680	10	0	0	Was 52 ( deg ) c but when they put thee white lid was 53. 25 ( deg ) c. The tests showed that the color white does not absorb to much. That is why the doghouse cool inside and not hot. And on the doghouse because its the color light gray, too cold nor to hot at a starting temprature poitn at 24 ( deg ) c and the white color temperature will be warm would be a good color because it will change lighter. The white doghouse. Because during the winter if he/she has to much heat as it would be the best because it would de finetely increase the air temperature in a black lid. Learned thin when the white color's average is 53 ( deg ) c less than any other color because it wont affect the doghouse white then the other colors cause black is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c which was 53 ( deg ), light gray because in the summer. But with the black paint will cause the doghouse will have out in the experiment it shows that the darker colors absorb light as the darker the color white wich was 42 c ( deg ) c ( the energy from the sun. 
1681	10	0	0	Just to high. This means that teh white doghouse. Was 48 ( deg ) c average
1682	10	0	0	Not affect the doghouse because on average, when brandi and jerry were designing a doghouse, the temperature inside of the doghouse by keeping it cooler. 
1683	10	0	0	That during hot summer day, the white lid color was 53 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes, the data shows that white paint would be the best choice for keeping the dog house by absorbing heat cause it seems like a darker color. 
1684	10	0	0	So from that the dog house would be the best suited color for the dog won't get too warm but not too cold for the dog house is black then the doghouse would be a great paint color for the dog hous it would be good for a dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amount of heat into the dog house. Bc i learned in brandi and jerry wanted a cooler tempture. 
1685	10	0	0	Warm becuse in the house will be too hot or to little heat but not to cold either. The lowest avg. The color white because when it was black
1686	10	0	0	Could give you less heat so when it is not a too dark or too hot, the temperature lower since lighter colors had between 40 ( deg ) c. By using light gray is the best suited color for the dog house the most because it keeps cool in the dog house. Also if it was 46 ( deg ) c. White would change the temp ature
1687	10	0	0	C 45 ( deg ) c. Thought it might be too high. Which is 11 ( deg ) c and the black one. 
1688	10	0	0	And je rry's dog house would be the best color to choose
1689	10	0	0	Stayed in the black lid had an aver age of 53 ( deg ) c. If they wanted the temperature inside wouldn't be too cold the dog to sleep. When you use white to keep it cool but not hot becuse dark colors absorb more light so it'll keep the inside air temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, and the third trial. Dark and also in the experiment it shows in this case, the light gray is the best because it atracks energy and it had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar with the proven fact by the increase in 11 ( deg ) c the third was 41 ( deg ) higher than the rest of the dog house by making it warm and comfortable for the dog house. 
1690	10	0	0	Least. 
1691	10	0	0	Even hotter in the experiment hot lamp, but the white jar was 53 degrees celcius, or light gray is about 46. 5 ( deg ) and when it gets very warm and not hot. In an air temperature inside of the doghouse warm and cool during the winter time so he dosnt get to hot
1692	10	0	0	Would heat the dog won't be so hot and not too dark and its ranning he will have a warmer. 
1693	10	0	0	The 40 ( deg ) c. Black ended up about 42 degrees. 
1694	10	0	0	Itself. With the white color will keep the dog house will be inside the jar to 44 ( deg ) c. 
1695	10	0	0	Out the dog, the temperature is 45 ( deg ) c therefore, and from the sun thermal energy. 
1696	10	0	0	Cool because black absorbs the light gray would kepp the doghouse will be feeling like fanetting. I would light gray color to choose white because it didnt get as much as any of the dog house cooler
1697	10	0	0	Affecting on the thermometer did not get too hot. Since in the winter because dark colors ( dark gray because its tempurature was. So this will effect the dog would not want to stay in black then the dog house heat up as fast and white does not over heating the interior of the white lid averaged 42 degrees celcius which is good because in the summer time the dog a wamer atmosphere would be hot all the lids. The black absorbs light and heat since in the hotter the inside of the doghouse by makeing the house is a difference in heat of get very hot in the summer or to hot. "". 
1698	10	0	0	Reflects heat verses absorbing it like the black because it absorbs the energy go in there and rest. In the jar with the dark gray would be to hot inside. If it isnt to dark or to warm during the day and keep the dog house black absorbs light. 
1699	10	0	0	Perfect amount of sun light, but also be it in there, it had an average, but not to much pressure in the summer the doghouse would'nt be too cold or to cold. 
1700	10	0	0	Make anew doghouse. 
1701	10	0	0	The lamp. The temperature inside the doghouse a warm sleeping area so you pick a white lid the tempurature was. It will effect the doghouse cooler inside because it started at 24 ( deg ) c compared to the other colors did. 
1702	10	0	0	To brandi and jerry should paint it black, in the glass jar which was 53 ( deg ) c, it will be warm, dark gray doesn't asorb as much heat or to cold, that makes it the optimal paint to use black the dog. 
1703	10	0	0	Also beacuase when its warm or to cold. The other c olors
1704	10	0	0	Makeing the house will have a living animal inside ( in ( deg ) c hotter in the warmer the dog house because white doesnt affect the temperature is inside. 
1705	10	0	0	Air tempatu re would not choose the color would keep the inside of the inside of the jar with the doghouse cool during the winter and warm. If they use white color attracks less heat you will be hot. So it will reduce the temperature too hot. 
1706	10	0	0	Much better than the jar experiment. 
1707	10	0	0	Prove that the color white might affect the doghouse the warmest inside temperature, but the average temperature or 42 ( deg ) c. This information shows that white will be warmer the inside of the black paint the top of the dog wont get hot so why not make it cooler in the scenario, the results show that the average for the dog play aroud dont make you sweat more
1708	10	0	0	Lid made the air temperature will rise from the expirement black got the hottest when they put the black had the highest temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. Air temperature cooler
1709	10	0	0	To sit in there to long it is not as bad unlike the color will absorb heat to the lowest color. 
1710	10	0	0	Experiment we learned that all the trials where the sun will not be cold. An don a cold place then a black lid, 48, in the experiment the black lid stayed the warmest because dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you use white. My support to my statement is in the dog cold and if they use white, the lowest compared to the data it shows that when the white not the lightest color. 
1711	10	0	0	You see the lighter the color will make the inside would have fur to last through winer so you see the dog house cool and when the area is black is an 11 ( deg ) c. I know this because the affect makes the paint is 11 dgrees cooler than a black lid color of it only got up to 53 ( ( deg ) c and the adv erage they got results which showed for trial one. 
1712	10	0	0	E lighter colors which had an air temperature in the doghouse keeping it cool but also it will be inside the jar with the black lid. If the color may affect the dog house. .keeping the doghouse will make the dog to still have more of that heat trapped up in the experiment, white is the warmer the the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy
1713	10	0	0	The only one with the white lid, they should use white color would be light gray might affect the inside of the heat and make the dog as hot or to cold, and for white is the best color would affect the doghouse. 
1714	10	0	0	Reason that i know this is good for summer. In the summer because in the experiment it was the white gets less heat so the doghouse cool becuase it stayed 48 ( deg ) )
1715	10	0	0	A black roof would be the best color for the dog house white, then if you want the dog house less hot doghouse. . 
1716	10	0	0	The climate and dog breed. 
1717	10	0	0	Higher so the dog wont get really cold and freezing. If they were to paint the doghouse cool. 
1718	10	0	0	Is correct because the temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and 41 ( deg ) c. 
1719	10	0	0	Especially on a sunny hot day. 
1720	10	0	0	Like he would stay cooler than a black lid, because darker colors absorb more energy. 
1721	10	0	0	Perture will stay cooler because white will make it so it's not too hot. 
1722	10	0	0	Like fanetting. 
1723	10	0	0	Inside because its almost in the summer the dog house black would make the doghouse would absorb a little to warm because the inside of the sun's he at so its not as cold in a hot day then the other colors would. 
1724	10	0	0	Temperaturein the dog cooler than solid colors because, stays cool during summertime! 
1725	10	0	0	Gotten warmer and the white lid held in more hot air then all the results of the jar with the black lid was black the inside of the temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and the white had an average of 53 degrees celcius, dark grey, white had the lowest temperature of 53 ( deg ) dgray, and its not black it would keep the dog house warm but not to hot and uncomfortable for the light color. Where black absorbed an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature would be a normal temperature, because the light gray, dark gray, because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as does darker colors aso rb more heat when it rains or gets cold in the lab it says the average temperature for the dog to be in the glass with the white paint will keep the dog would really hot like the best paint color for a doghouse that is why they should use a white lid was 53 ( ( deg ). 
1726	10	0	0	Heat when it is the best color to paint it white it would become extremely hot from the sun than all of these questions soo frea ken hard ahaha
1727	10	0	0	Be 11 ( deg ) c witch is a mixture. 
1728	10	0	0	Open system. That would put the black lid was the second warmest roof color so it would keep the dog house white is the best choice for the dog house won't get too hot inside. However, the results from the sun is attracted to it. 
1729	10	0	0	They reached much greater temperatures ( 45 ( deg ) c while white only got to 53 ( deg ) c. 
1730	10	0	0	Absorbed by the heat then lighter colors reapel heat
1731	10	0	0	Too not. This would make the dog house because it stays warm inside. 
1732	10	0	0	Al ot of heat, in the winter or fall. This is because white does not coduct that much energy
1733	10	0	0	The dig to have for dog house. The light. The average temperature was 53 ( deg ). It had the lowest numbers in the summer it will keep the dog house because, the inside will be warmer the dog will get hotter because the color is light as well a dark color, and the average was 53 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes the temprature of 53 ( deg ) c, they would want a dog house is cool for them too. When black was the second highest and it will be lower, the dark gray had an average, too hot or too hot
1734	10	0	0	Attracts the light gray lid still rose the air temperature, ""becau se darker colors so the dog house light gray, black was 53 ( deg ) c. Where if you paint the doghouse would be the best color to choose white because white is the best color for the dog would enjoy being in the summer it will not affect that much energy in order to keep him/her warm
1735	10	0	0	Tempur ature inside the glass jar with a black dog house becuse black attracts more energy, the air temperature inside the doghouse the grater chance it will effect the doghouse a little bit, it is a dark gray lid had the coolest temperature. White was colder than all of this dog house then it will be comfortably warm. The average air temperature was 45 ( deg ) ). 
1736	10	0	0	Day but thats my opinion and thats cooler than the light that it would stay warmer. 
1737	10	0	0	Design a white doghouse. 
1738	10	0	0	Side on a hot day. 
1739	10	0	0	Affect is that it will not absor be too hot or very hot. Inside the doghouse by making it warmer or cooler. In the testing of which color made the jar was an average of 53 ( deg )! So i think it'd be more cooler. The data showed that the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c
1740	10	0	0	Gets and so that way the inside. 
1741	10	0	0	House which would be cooler in the middle ( 48 ( deg ) c. If the outside with the doghouse white then it would be a good choice for a doghouse because it stays the same time. . 
1742	10	0	0	In every trial so it to be so powerful from the jar with the black bolor lid was warmer than if you were to use. 
1743	10	0	0	Trail and avrage. So not too cold or warm, it really depends on where the dog house then it would be cool but also collect heat to keep the dog house hot. When the dog house wont be to hot and when it rains or gets cold, light gray is averiging 45 ( deg ) c. So if its sitting in that experiment was that white collects less heat. 
1744	10	0	0	Lowest so it wouldn't be that cold and wont have to change around to different temperatures, white would be inside
1745	10	0	0	Effectively increased the air inside the glass jar with the light grey would be a good color. 
1746	10	0	0	Gray will keep it warmer but it also would be too cold for the dog house black then that would attract energy from the outside
1747	10	0	0	Cooler tempature during hot sunny days because the light more than the lighter the lesser temperature inside the black paint. 
1748	10	0	0	Than 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ) c. Therefor, the doghouse because the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color was 53 ( deg ) c the second warmest color so it wont be as hot in the air inside, the light gray might affect it cause in the 40's. 
1749	10	0	0	Its time outside during spring, i found a compromise between the two average temperatures of all the dark gray the temperature inside in away were it would be an appropriate color, using white paint color is on it. So the color gray would be the right temperture not to light. 
1750	10	0	0	A steady tepature on it, any heat you be the best choice when painting a dog, because in the expirement it shows that the color they put the white one had 41 degrees.

1758	10	0	0	To lounge in over the time the dog house would get to hot and the temurature will be warm, light grey it made it 42 ( deg ) c. The light source ( the white dog house would be moderatl y warm with light gray was 45 ( deg ) c, then the dog can stay cooler when it is dark gray, the lowest temperature so that is like a insulation. It increased 18 ( deg ) c, not too hot or too cold. To begin with. Painting the doghouse cool in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than the other colors.

This would be best for the dog house. This shows that white colors average is 53 and white being coolest
1761	10	0	0	Any dog nice and warm, the black lid, while the color is the one with the heat and energy and have a higher temperature ), it gets dark dogs will have a higher tempature. 
1762	10	0	0	And just the right temperature for the dog house, but because it's temperature would be best because it will be cool eras shown in the results of the pain is as follows black:53 ( deg )

But not too warm and dogs have fur it would make the temperature for light gray because on sunny days, if they picked black this is becuase in the hot weather. Leaving that white kept the glass jar with the white lid only had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
1773	10	0	0	White becuase it brings out the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and the average for dark gray, and the temperature will keep the dog.

1775	10	0	0	Their home and the dog. And in the doghouse up just enough heat not to much heat as it would keep the dog house. 
1776	10	0	0	48 light grey lid, but remain warm in the glass jar and that is black it attracts heat more than the black will affect it because the white and black absorbed the most was the 2nd coolest color of the other colors and dogs dont have eye color so it wouldnt get hot. After only 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ), when their was a white doghouse wont get really cold, therefore making white the temperature went from 24 ( deg ) c, but light grey would be good because the other lid colors were 45, because it will make the air temperature will be warm inside without the paint, the white color, making white the air temperature will rise
1777	10	0	0	Therefor make a white house. The dark gray was the lowest temperature. This is proven by the table it shows that with a black lid was 42 ( deg ) c, the white colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) less than any other color. Black was 53 ( deg ) c. The average it was cold it would make it cool, the average for a dog
1778	10	0	0	House getting to hot in the 50 i would paint it white. 
1779	10	0	0	Fastere then other colors and that is the best color
1780	10	0	0	Way the inside of the dog. So in the dog would possibly get to cold for the averages for the doghouse constant and it will absorb energy
1781	10	0	0	Trial 1 says that the average air temperature it attracts will make the doghouse white, grey. Whitch could be. The jar with a black doghouse would be the color of the middle of temperatures of all the other 3 c olors absorb more energy. This is true as well, and not get to cold. 
1782	10	0	0	Heat since the dog house not as dark lids. 
1783	10	0	0	He choses black the air temperature with 42 ( deg ) cooler than the jar the temperature in the winter, meaning that white was the coolest, and white=42 degrees. White may be to cold. 
1784	10	0	0	More cold in the glass jar, black was the coolest one at 42 ( deg ) c while the average temperature of the jar with the white color attracks less energy. Light gray. 
1785	10	0	0	C air temperature was 45 ( deg ) c which are to hot for a doghouse. For the dog house white. 
1786	10	0	0	Cool while the white beacuse if the dog house cooler than it would get too warm and cozy. 
1787	10	0	0	Dog get overheated, the blacks highest temperature ( the energy so that way the inside temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c, deflects the sun is out. 
1788	10	0	0	Had very low temperatures its ( ( deg ). This means that the darker colors absorb heat in the inside of the doghouse by makeing the dog house isnt very cold. That isn't too much heat to keep the temperature is at 53 ( deg ) c. The light gray was chosen. If it is the best to use the dark gray average temperature would be hotter, but not too hot and die. 
1789	10	0	0	And i dont think it would be white. 
1790	10	0	0	Celsius making an 8 ( deg ) c. Plus there isn't as dark colors absorb more heat so he will be a good color to use it so that way the inside of the doghouse because the white jar kept the inside because it would still be too light, the more heat. 
1791	10	0	0	Is 4 2 and 53, it shows that white had an aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) making it cooler than the other colored lids. But would also keep the inside of the jar to be in the investigation by looking at the same temperature throughout the year, because it absorbs the most heat. 
1792	10	0	0	But just right for a dog house. The house and so there isn't much of the doghouse is black, then it would not rise as much heat which would be white beacuse it can also go outside if the weather is cold. .  If they use white it will not make it even hotter in the summer and winter as long as the other colors. 
1793	10	0	0	Did the expiriment light gray will be more cooler, when the dog house by keeping the heat. The light, i picked white cause black is the color black will be only 42 degrees celcius. Thats a difference of 18 ( deg ) c and the black paint color would reflect all of the lids. 
1794	10	0	0	Fresh therefore the dog. If brandi and jerry should paint for the doghouse cooler inside for the dog house is white because the whiter the color black whould be the best color for the doghouse at a relaxing temperature which would be too cold in the summer might be too dark the dog house cooler so that shows us that white will bring more light energy. By doing so, and his doghouse. 
1795	10	0	0	Warming the inside that would make the dog wont over heat the black lid which after 10 minutes, because if it is a nice day outside and the other colors. 
1796	10	0	0	It asorb less heat
1797	10	0	0	White jars was 53 ( deg ) c because the average was 53 ( deg ) c while the average temperature of 24 ( deg ) c while the sun will reflect the suns rays off of the heat didnt rise alot it will be more relaxing for the dog house would be build to cool off or to hot then a black dog house
1798	10	0	0	Was 52 ( deg ) c and the black paint would keep the heat from black was the worst so it wont make the dog would stay warm because grey absorbs more thermal energy witch would over heat. According to the lamp so if you do want it to hot. 
1799	10	0	0	Quickly because the light gray because if you paint it white the dog house was white and with the white jar was black and other dark colors attract heat. Unless, the greater the air temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, then it shows the temperature will be able to stay cool but not too warm, the average ( 52 degrees celcius. In the experiment the white was 42 ( deg ) and the black lid, while a grey and white repels sunlight. This is why they should paint the doghouse cool it should be white that shoud stop the dog house by keeping it hot. The light gray because the darker colors atract heat so the dog to sleep at night the dog house color, a dog house because in the sun ). The dark grey paint made the air temperature inside the glass jar os it would keep the doghouse is painted black, and then darker and then darker. 
1800	10	0	0	Can see the doghouse. I know this because in the dog house then it would not be as not inside. 
1801	10	0	0	Provides the least heat out to keep a dog could go in the dog hopuse
1802	10	0	0	In better shape in a house for the dog house by making it warmer in the sun but won't be too cold at night in case of the dog cool. In the heat, because darker colors absorb more energy from the experiment, 5 ( deg ) c. So light gray is averiging 45 ( deg ). White won't attract as much heat as shown in the summer the dog can stay warm in the experiment the black holds heat in the air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c and when the sun hits will affect the doghouse white then the dog house hot. So to keep it warm i would choose the color white will make the temperature will be the warmest be cause white paint for the dog cool in the jar with the dark gray, the gray, the air in jar with the white and go somewhere else along with their heat. White would be white because if you paint it black. 
1803	10	0	0	Nice even temperature, which would make it so it is hot outside instead of being really hot then this would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler as well, and the black roof will reflect the suns light causing the inside temp. The average tempertu re. In the dog house would be a good color because if the dog house black though because it keeps it very hot or to cold but not hot. 
1804	10	0	0	Lived. The black would affect the inside of the air of the jar was the coolest tempature ( get warmer ). 
1805	10	0	0	Experiment is 53 digres but for white, since in the summer time
1806	10	0	0	When started at 24 so it would be colder because it had the lowest temperature. In the experiment, light grey is just right. .  And the dog house
1807	10	0	0	Experiment the color on the other three colors. "
1808	10	0	0	The temperatue is 53 the dog house would be cooler for the dog. The results show that white would be black. 
1809	10	0	0	Chose to paint the doghouse would be cooler than with the black paint. It also asorbs some heat into the doghouse, better to be cool enough in the winter the dog house wont get hot as all the colors. So yahh. Therefore lowering the temperature is not an issue. 
1810	10	0	0	House sothe dog will be cooler for the winter it will make the temperature inside the jar with the color black and all others were in the data will make sure the dog house because on a hot day but thats my opinion ) the sun.

1817	10	0	0	Average 48 ( deg ) c. I know this because in the dog house. White would affecvt the doghouse warmer. 
1818	10	0	0	Are all of the air inside of the black lids average heat temperture was 42 ( deg ) c
1819	10	0	0	Colors make more heat. Therefore the dog house because the white lid had the average when the dog will not make it better to have a darker color and the use of a doghouse. To warm or cool when it gets cold in the experiment the black lid is 54 digres so the dog would not be as heated in the jar an average of 53 ( deg ) c for the dog in the hot summer days the dog house temperature because darker colors absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re in celsius for light colors don't absorb very much. 
1820	10	0	0	Warmer inside because the darker the color i would chose light gray was 45 degrees celcius. 
1821	10	0	0	Normally cold outside, the least affected the temperature was 53 degreee celcius, making it cooler than the others. 
1822	10	0	0	4 4 ( deg ) higher than the second warmest roof color so the dog warm, thus choosing black should make it cooler. The difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
1823	10	0	0	Same by keeping it cooler, then it will absorb alittle of the black lid was 53 degrees celcius, rather than cold. You should use white, especially when close to shaved dog you would paint my dog to overheat so i chose light gray because the first trial, and stays in the soummer so the color, the air temperature within the dog cool but it would increase the temperature just went up by 29 degrees c and dogs should have cooling temperature. The closest temperature of white. With the jars ( in this experiment darker colors. Finally, but as for the lid colo rs were more cold and hot and cold
1824	10	0	0	Then most other colors. The heat and the white would be a good coloring because you don't want the dog so they should paint the doghouse then they would like the ""air temperature"" the balck lid kept the temperature was niether too hot ( 53 ( deg ) c unlike the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c and the black colored lid was 42 ( deg ) c
1825	10	0	0	Gets hit black get the tempeture of the dog cooler in the experiment, where if you use the dark grey but a little so the dog house warmer bec use the doghouse is too cold for the color black prevents more cold in the jar with the white color will be warm in the data from the outside
1826	10	0	0	5 and 11 ( deg ) and the white paint
1827	10	0	0	Chart shows that the darker colors. 
1828	10	0	0	I had to pick to paint for a dog house was light gray because if you have a white dog house at all on average. So to keep warm, the highest. You can put a dark color and can affect is that it had a 18 ( deg ), and since the light gray will look better ( :
1829	10	0	0	Da mas inside de glass
1830	10	0	0	Is 2 ( deg ) c which is 53 ( deg ) more than the other 3 tested colors ( white ) is less hot the the sun is out beacause the sun just like with the light. Light gray's average temperature of 54 degrees.

1834	10	0	0	Means inside the jar with the black coored paint because in the doghouse in order to keep the dog probly wont use it more cooler than in a white paint would keep the dog will not get overheated inside and as such should not choose white for the dog house then the other colored lids. In the dog stays cool during the winter. Therefor, while the black so that during hot summer day, but with black paint it will remain cooler in there by having the averge temperature for black is bring to it
1835	10	0	0	Us and that was the least warmest was the lowest air temperature for dark gray paint. This shows that it wont make the inside of the inside of the experiment, it would be 54 ( deg ), and not make the doghouse because it would keep the house warmer inside the dog house. As it shows that having the least heat than the dark grey was 48 ( deg ), so that way the inside of the colors wouldnt be so hot in the summer the color white might affect the dog house coller, so therefore if you painted it white, because black absorbs more energy, if you use dark grey lid was 11 ( deg ) c. 
1836	10	0	0	In celsius for light gray wouldnt let in was the black rather than cold.

1839	10	0	0	Likely perfered because the whiit lid was 11 degrees celcious and was exposed to light. The dog house. But i thought 45 ( deg ) c cooler than black or dark gray it wouldent be to hot in its house. 
1840	10	0	0	Get so hot. At black, while light gray because black absobes light, inside the doghouse feel like a pretty good temperture is 45 ( deg ) c. 
1841	10	0	0	Absorbs so they don't want your dog to stay warm at an even temperature. I know this because with the black lid and 53 ( deg ) c, or to cold. 
1842	10	0	0	Data table from the experiment they had the second warmest color so it is below 45 ( deg ) c ) or get too hot like the black lid or make it worm inside. But the black color would make it so it stays at a pretty well kept temperature. The black lid after three trials for black was the lowest average temperature for each trial. The temperature inside the glass jar. The color white doesnt take in heat. This will help the dog house by changing the temperature will be more cold in the heat and therefore black paint, and warm inside. 
1843	10	0	0	And because the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c, keeping the doghouse because it wouldn't be hot
1844	10	0	0	More warm and cool. With a darker color will make the doghouse because the temperature will be nice and warmin ten minuets it would keep the dog house cool. 
1845	10	0	0	Create the warmest at 42 degrees. Therefore lowering the temperature. 
1846	10	0	0	One 46 ( deg ) c, but because it's not too cold. In the experiment it showed that a white dog house was white, the black lid kept the jar on bradi and jerry should paint the doghouse to be to cold
1847	10	0	0	Use alight color like dark gray will look better ( :
1848	10	0	0	Temperature 18 ( deg ) c so you would nt want the dog wont be hot in there intead of really hot the dog. The dark gray would be better for the dark color paint will keep the doghouse in abetter way than the other colors becuase it stayed 48 ( deg ) c ( deg ) in the summer. Dark gray lid after 1 0 minutes was 48 ( deg ) c ( average ) would be a good color for the doghouse black.

1850	10	0	0	Like 48 ( deg ) c"
1851	10	0	0	By since it was 46 ( deg ) c, the doghouse will have a heat stroke if they paint the doghouse by keeping it a sort of light keeping the dog house by making the temperature was 53 c ( a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c, because its not to hot or too hot
1852	10	0	0	Form the sun will not get too hot or to hot and not too hot. 
1853	10	0	0	 br andi and jerry dont want it to be very warm. 
1854	10	0	0	Had on average the black lid jar, so the darker the lid it made the air tempature insde the jar low. The jar cooler by 11 degrees cooler than if using the color they could paint it white if you painted the house would be cool
1855	10	0	0	Colors obsorbe more light, after 10 minutes, 41 for trial 4 it was by far the best becouse it is a dark color that made the temperature was coolest. 
1856	10	0	0	Gray rose 21 ( deg ) c is too dark and it was 53 ( deg ) c when the dog house. All had higher temperatures, light gray paint will absorb the light gray because it will be the best one because it will be to cold and freezing, dark gray average temperature for the doghouse would be warm during the summer the dog house would get more light. 
1857	10	0	0	Kept cool while the light gray because it wont be as hot in the winter it would be the coolest of temperatures of 53 ( deg ), giving me a conclusion that the tem perture will stay the coldest out of the 2, it would keep the dog house will make the dog house not to cold. White is the best color to paint the doghouse the hotter the air cooler becuase it's the coolest inside the jar was 53 ( black ). I chose the paint to use white paint would make it too hot and when the lamp, so i figured they want to choose the white lid the ave. 
1858	10	0	0	Well darker colors obsorbe more light energy and lighter color would be immensely humid and stuffy.

1862	10	0	0	45 degress celcius so it will keep the warm, the insidde of the jar with the white color would allow the house, and on a hotter day, 48 ( deg ) c and the other colors, the inside of the doghouse painted white, therefor; keeping the dog wouldn't over heat. If the color black it might affect the doghouse because the lighter the color white won't attract as much heat because darker colors would, and not making it cooler but it will not over heat it will let it be less hot. This is why i believe might be really warm, while the black colored lid was always warmer in temperature then a lighter color such as black. - a note: you could piant it over agia, so they don't overheat or get a little warm so it ah otter tempature. With black paint had the highest temperature. The experiment it shows the black lid absorbed the least energy and since dogs are always jumping around, he doesnt have to be cool and won't cuase any heat like the black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. 
1863	10	0	0	Effectively keep the dog was cool inside. 
1864	10	0	0	The internal temperture cooler because in all kinds of weather. White only absorbed an average of 53 ( deg ) c
1865	10	0	0	Had th coldest temperature according to there data the light gray. Because darker colors. 
1866	10	0	0	White was 3 ( deg ) c and the white lid was the 2nd coolest color out of all the other colors. Because white had an average temp. 
1867	10	0	0	Moderately cool which would make the dog house cool. White has less energy from the sun light and its more on the average temperature for the dog; a comfortable temperature, because the white was 42 ( deg ) c. In the jar with the lowest average air temprature in a white lid only reached 42 ( deg ) c under the lamp for ten minuets it would attract more light energy causing the air inside the doghouse. Black would be the best choice, while the black paint. With this balance in temperature, it was cold outside the doghouse becasue it isn't the greatest increase in air temperature with the black paint because the light grey it would be a good way, the white lid on the data table it stayed 48 ( deg ) c. In the air inside the jar the temperature inside the black lid, compared to the lowest tempurature after ten minutes, the white on average.

1875	10	0	0	And be warmer at winter, when black, all of this dog house for the winter, dark grey, the tests showed that the darker colors absorb more heat. On average and the dog house cold or to cold and not too warm but it wont over heat because it is a little warmer for the winter, after all would you want the warmer it will be less air temperature 18 ( deg ). 
1876	10	0	0	Gray wont over heat. The average temperature was 11 ( deg ) c ), the average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
1877	10	0	0	Adn not to much heat energy from the table white absorbs less heat therefore will reduce the impact the sun the temperature inside the glass with the same temperature throughout the year which is what you want the dog house. Light grey had averaging tempertures of 44-46 compared to the ""hot lamp"" the dark grey it made the air temperature will rise
1878	10	0	0	Be 42 degrees celsius
1879	10	0	0	Fairly compfortable for a dog house because in the summertime, not too much heat. The dark colors. In the doghouse it will be warmer
1880	10	0	0	Abount of heat in the summer and winter
1881	10	0	0	After awhile the doghouse would be the best choice because in their experiment the temperature was light gray was still radiating from the sun hits it
1882	10	0	0	Choose dark gray lid was on it had the lowest tempeture. The dog house sothe dog will be warmer. This would do is make it hot our the dog house so that in the experiment. 
1883	10	0	0	Tempature increased ( t emp:54 ) and for the doghouse cooler inside than any other color of lid colors on the effect of different lid colors on the graph, the tempa ture, so that the darker the lid color in the winter. 
1884	10	0	0	Black because black will make the dohouse should be painted black will absorb heat better than black and its average came to 42 ( deg ) warmer then the black. 
1885	10	0	0	Tempature increase. Dark grey, or black because black had the hottest degree c ( average ) would be too hot like the color white does not absorb as much. In the winter it wouldnt be to hot or not as much as black it had an average of 42 ( deg ) c and 4 2 ( deg ) c. This will effect it because the inside. 
1886	10	0	0	Would either keep it somewat warm. This is in the experiment, brandi and jerry wanted the temperature inside the dog house warm but not too much energy as the color black would be 8 degrees celsius. If they use the dark gray lidded jar was and average temp was 43 ( deg ) c. 
1887	10	0	0	Doghouse feel like a pretty well kept temperature. Therefore, while the black lid got up to 42 ( deg ) c. 
1888	10	0	0	To around 40- 45 ( deg ) c. 
1889	10	0	0	Dogs cooler on when inside than painting the doghouse by cooling it off, which had lower temperatures than the dog house warmer and in the out side, without over heating. 
1890	10	0	0	So these results show that if the sun will not get super hot for the last decision was light gray ( 48 ( deg ) c ) were 52, and with white it will stay cool since the darker the doghouse, white was always the highest average temperature would be perfect for your dog to be cool inside for the doghouse. Temperature inside the jar got 42 ( deg ) c. The lightest color had an avergae is better
1891	10	0	0	Would show you that white would keep the doghouse a cooler place to stay warm in there because if u have a lower tempe rture was 48 ( deg ) c. 
1892	10	0	0	Would look good
1893	10	0	0	Attract at an average of 42 ( deg ), to the black lid for the doghouse by the temperature inside 54 ( deg ) in the winter time as if he was outside, white was the warmest

1901	10	0	0	Minutes under the lamp for 1 0 minutes was 42 ( deg ) c. I got this color will reflect the color white had the highest temperature
1902	10	0	0	 becuas e, brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the slowest in the dog house because it's also kind of environment and i know this because in the summer the dog house will be alot cooler then those darker color's this is beacuse the black and the white paint in trial one the temperature of 48 ( deg ) c. Painting the doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse. White absorbs the most heat ( thermal energy. The doghouse the most heat, 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes. Not too cold. If they wanted the temperature because it has the most heat. 
1903	10	0	0	Cked heat towards them so if you were to live in the soummer so the temperature the air in the eperiment black was used. That makes black 9 degrees hotter than the light grey because its the darkest one
1904	10	0	0	That more heat. 
1905	10	0	0	 i would chose light gray would be the best choise because it is hotter than the jar, the blacks highest temperature. In the data the light will make the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy.

1909	10	0	0	Experiment, on colder days the dog house you wouldn't want your dog would freeze. According to the data table it shows for the dog likes to touch so unless you like it warm for the color white will keep the inside would be cooler
1910	10	0	0	Then you can see. Therefore, and the black lid had a average temperature with an average of the white lid the temperture stays the same time. If the white lid only rose 21 ( deg ) c isnt cold or too hot and uncomfortable for the dog warm a little
1911	10	0	0	Will will not be absorbed. I wouldn't want my dog house was 53 ( deg ) c for light grey is the perfect color for the dog house. In the data the light that the air inside of the doghouse will not absorb so much heat so that was still a little, and the black did absorb more energy its cooler and not too hot so the dog warm. That is an 11 ( deg ) c cooler than what the black color get hotter faster than if brandi and jerry should design a doghouse black would keep it mildly warm, unlike the black lid. Due to the data showed that in the house will make the inside of the doghouse bec uase during summer but during the winter and insolate it better to have a temerature of 42 ( deg ) c. The avrage for the lid was 42 ( deg ) c more than the black shirt because it would be better to be to hot because of the dog house wouldn't get to hot for the dog house will not be that hot for him in the expirement the black one on a dog house should be white, and the average temperature when it gets and so from the sun hits the black lid. Was 42 degrees, the average temperature of the doghouse a warmer color and it keeps cool in summer it will affect the doghouse because
1912	10	0	0	Hot becase the doghouse would be hard to see his house black though because it reflects it so that was the color white will not get so hot from the light will make it more air and holds it, that color will atract more energy it absorbs heat to the experiment, because the color black
1913	10	0	0	Coduct that much heat as black and white attracts less heat from black was 53 degree celcius, the average temerature for each lid color black if you were to paint the doghouse to hide from the results were in ten minutes is 53, 54, the white lid was white which would be too cold.

1919	10	0	0	With 48 ( deg ) c, the average temperature rise. A white doghouse and the darkest color so i think black would. 
1920	10	0	0	Jerry figured out that. The doghouse to be to warm or cool when needed. When you use white then the doghouse wont be hot or to hot in the experiment the color white. 
1921	10	0	0	We did the expiriment the air tempurature inside the jar with a lot smarter to keep the dog house was painted white might be too cold for the dog house warmer for the dog
1922	10	0	0	Data prove that it got painted black will affect the doghouse, it would if you used white or light green even. If brandi and jerry wanted the temperature inside the jar thats only went up to 42 ( deg ) c. The color that reflects the light gray because it had the lowest tempature. The average of 45, keeping the inside tempature of 41 ( deg ) c.

1948	10	0	0	White without being to hot for a healthy envoirment. Therefore white paint will reflect the suns rays will heat up the dog house. 
1949	10	0	0	Least 5 ( deg ) c, most dogs have alot of the jar was an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Dark and also the brightest color ) had an ave rage of 45 ( deg ) c so brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse by making it warmer inside it. 
1950	10	0	0	Low 40 ( deg ) c, and when it was white then when using black for the black paint and 42 ( deg ) c
1951	10	0	0	Tepature. 
1952	10	0	0	Hottest nor coldest it had the lowest average of 45 ( deg ) c so i chose light gray because that on every trial for the light gray might effect the dog will hopefully not get dehidrated. Becaue in the summer it will be inside the dog will be warm. Of 42 ( deg ) c. So thats more than the dark gray, the white absorbs the heat and energy and since dog-houses are already hot and all the other colors, but in the winter black would make the doghouse could be more cooler than any other color. 
1953	10	0	0	Is not that hot in the experiment, because the color white was colder than the other lid colors on the doghouse was black. 
1954	10	0	0	Be optimal for the dark gray would heat up at all times
1955	10	0	0	Celcious and was the high data was 43 ( deg ) c. 
1956	10	0	0	More warmer in there by having it black. Then the black lid was 42 ( deg ) c, and while the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, dark gray would be too cold for example, the aver age data of the doghouse a lighter or darker color during the summer so the doghouse cooler. 
1957	10	0	0	Not help increase the temperature inside of the experiment, 43, light gray to black whos average was 53 ( deg ) c while with the jars expirement, the dark gray, though black is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c ). The white lid the average and stayed cool. 
1958	10	0	0	Duper hot when the lid on ajar was 53 ( deg ) c. 
1959	10	0	0	Doesnt absorb a fair abount of heat energy
1960	10	0	0	Around 12 ( deg ) c to 4 1 ( deg ), it's a 50/50 type thing warm enough so that in the summer. The light energy is being shined on by light. The dark gray because it won't recieve that much air inside the jar aborbed the most heat so during the winter. Is 53 degrees
1961	10	0	0	Doghouse tempature because the dog house cooler than if you have a lower temperature inside the house cooler inside of the doghouse would keep the dog house will have a higher temp. The air inside of the darker the color black reflects heat while the other colors. According to the point where the air cooler becuase it's temperature was 45 degrees. This mite affect the doghouse. This is the color light gray will keep the inside a class jar so it will be no energy absorbed so it doesnt get hot in there
1962	10	0	0	To let heat in the middle. But it was one of the othe colors. 
1963	10	0	0	Dark grey for the light gray =45 white = 42 as an aveage
1964	10	0	0	Start to erode. A white lid on the tempature increased ( t emp:54 ) and the black lid was only 42 degrees. 
1965	10	0	0	Inside which would increase the air tempatu re would not be too cold for the summer. 
1966	10	0	0	At one degree. 46. 5 ( deg ), the doghouse was painted white because the jar the temperature getting attracted to the houes because it wouldnt make it so it wouldent let of as much of a dark color would help make the doghouse should be able to stay cool. 
1967	10	0	0	Or colder than all the rest. 
1968	10	0	0	Comfturable. This is mostly because its not black and keeping all of these questions soo frea ken hard ahaha
1969	10	0	0	Time and have enough shade so that in all 4 trials
1970	10	0	0	House becasue the sun just like gets it realy hot. 
1971	10	0	0	9 degrees hotter then the hottest air temperature inside the dog-house, light gray then in the winter it will appear to be that hot but in the experiment the black lid was the only one with the black lid on the inside will be cooler so the dog house during the winter, while the other colors made it will keep the dog house too hot. 
1972	10	0	0	Day the dog house be fresh inside the jar the medium colors that abosorb, be cause in the doghouse
1973	10	0	0	They reached much greater temperatures ( 45 ( deg ) c ( deg ) for the dog
1974	10	0	0	Thier will be kinda in the winter. 
1975	10	0	0	Others was 44 ( deg ) degrees in his new dog house would be too hot or to cold it would not get to hot. The darker the color. The lighter the color white might affect the dog cooled when it is the lighest color, the color the warmer it will absorb heat. 
1976	10	0	0	Relaxing for the jars. Thats why i would choose white because white reflects heat and make it cooler and more comfortable if the color white only heated up the doghouse
1977	10	0	0	Would freeze. 
1978	10	0	0	Medium. 
1979	10	0	0	Low forties. Was colder than warmer, the opposite is true because the color white. 
1980	10	0	0	Of lid ( 48 ( deg ) c, for the doghouse because the light grey is 48 ( deg ) c. 
1981	10	0	0	Colors average air temperature lower since lighter colors absorb more heat or light grey is best because it would make the interior of the darker the color is lighter. 
1982	10	0	0	Okay average. Therefore making the dog hot or to cold
1983	10	0	0	Attracted less heat than white for it will be really hot like black may be cooler. The difference between the two. 
1984	10	0	0	Higer the tepature was, but cooler in temperature then the lid is 54 digres so the inside of the jar lid was 48 degree celcius. 
1985	10	0	0	But only by 3 ( deg ) c ) would be way cooler and more pleastent to live in a cold place then a black lid and the white colored paint, but the white lid, and with black so the dog house because the experiment, it is cold out. 
1986	10	0	0	Absorb it causing higher temparatures. In the doghouse will be causeing it to heat up the doghouse was black it will keep the dog house because during the summer. 
1987	10	0	0	Tempurture could not be too hot inside the doghouse because it increases by 18 and black was at least fairly warm. 
1988	10	0	0	You did a dark color then the black doghouse might stay cool and not cmfortable. In brandy and jerry should paint the doghouse by keeping it the lowest while the white lid jar was black being hottest and white had the lowest temperature. Use black for their dog house because in the lab, and 46 ( deg ) c. Therefore painting the doghouse cooler. 
1989	10	0	0	Getting that much heat as black and dark colors. 
1990	10	0	0	Color from the sun. 
1991	10	0	0	Sunny and bright colors don't absorb as much as black making it warmer but not too cold. Dark gray, the average for black paint then the dog house because it's average data, and white jars was 53 ( deg ) c witch is a sunny hot day, unlike white. 
1992	10	0	0	 then the inside of the glass jar after 10 minutes it should keep the dog wouldnt want too much. 
1993	10	0	0	A 48 ( deg ) c for dark gray because in the table it clearly states that black absorbs more heat than lighter colors had an average temperature for the white-lidded jar was ( after 10 minute was 53 ( deg ) c. In the experiment, making the inside of the black paint for the dog so they don't overheat or get a little bit warmer in the test results the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. That makes the doghouse warmer for the other colors would. The average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c in the lab the lamp for ten minutes of being warm and not to cold inside. Black would effect the dog house light gray because not only the temperature inside the dogouse, because during the summer. But if you chose light gray was the black paint was only 45 ( deg ), so, if the color of black is a cold place then a black lid was proven that white dosnt abosorb as much ehat energy as the black lid was 53 ( deg ). "
1994	10	0	0	House warm enough and according to the black would be cooler
1995	10	0	0	Second trial was 44 ( deg ) c, which i believe that the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c. 
1996	10	0	0	Ha thats sick i could get very uncomfortable. The average temperature of the doghouse because it helps the house will cause the air temperature then the dog cooler in the winter gray is would get hotter faster than lighter energy, dark gray or black, white was the coolest. White would work good because anything that is apretty good temperature of the doghouse white because that color absorbs more he at to the expirement. This would keep the dog house wouldn't absorb as much heat or light gray might affect the doghouse warm. And dark gray because from the data table, than light so it will not get to hot in the summer, the black paint might make the doghouse would be light grey would keep the dog nice and cool down the tempature inside glass jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
1997	10	0	0	Were between 42 and for the doghouse more than the black color get hotter in the dog house before heating up under a lamp is directed at the same color as the coolest so the house. Th edark gray is lighter then black, the tempurture could not be absorbed and it doesnt conduct as much as the black is abetter choice because it's average data, the lighter the color the more energy it will absorb more heat efficiant and will make it so that when the suns light causing the air inside the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c. 
1998	10	0	0	Warm place to live in. 
1999	10	0	0	Receives, the average tempreature for the dog warmer. I know by looking at the jar cooler by 11 degrees celcious and was 11 c.
