3000	10	0	0	Perfect temperature because it will not be too hot or too cold. I know this because in the results black got the hottest. 
3001	10	0	0	The density of hotness. 
3002	10	0	0	Hotter the inside of the doghouse because, based on the experiment, the temperature inside the dog house. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and hotter during the summer. 
3003	10	0	0	Its hot during summer so that way when the dog is outside and needs a rest. 
3004	10	0	0	Inside a doghouse, and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c while the black lid kept the temperature to 53 ( deg ), the average for a white lid and 53 ( deg ) and the white only got up to 43 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 18 ( deg ), 53 ( deg ) and 50 ( deg ) c when it is a sunny day, the dog inside the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun. 
3005	10	0	0	The data the result was, the greater the increase in air inside the doghouse. Making the temperature cooler then if it were painted black or the two shades of gray. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. So it would keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be inside the dog house
3006	10	0	0	Shows that having a black lid on trial one. 
3007	10	0	0	Went up to 45, 48, light gray, i would choose white, it had the lowest air temperature with 42 ( deg ) c cooler then the black, dark gray at 48 ( deg ). This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ), for light gray it was 45 ( deg ) c, 52 ( deg ) c. Dark gray's average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c ) was 54, in the 20 ( deg ) c. This showes that the darker the color, the average temperature of the glass jar then the lid would absorb more of the heat. 
3008	10	0	0	Sure the starting temperature inside the jar an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3009	10	0	0	Be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white then the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur to keep them warm. It will keep the inside of the dog house would be black because the darker the color there is, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold for the dog so it would be to hot to live in ( for a dog ) but it would be warm in the doghouse. So if you paint the house white or light gray and not too hot. In the investigation. 
3010	10	0	0	Less heat energy then the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) and the average for the black was 53 ( deg ), the warmer the tempature inside the dog house would keeps orta cool, as it would be black. Light grey would affect the temperature because white absorbs less heat than the other colors
3011	10	0	0	That much heat like the other colors. But if the area you live in is always cold i would paint it white. The white would be 42 ( deg ) c and the glass with the white lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c, so in the middle will be the best choice because its not to light and its not to light and its not to cold. 
3012	10	0	0	Hot not to cold. The average temperature inside the glass jar and record as trial 1.
3013	10	0	0	Give the dog house some darkness but also bright, cheerful and an elegant color and the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will stay warm. Also it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer. 
3014	10	0	0	A white doghouse would be the better paint color to keep the dog warm in the winter. 
3015	10	0	0	White that was 42 ( deg ) c, a darker color results in hotter tempatures. The darker paint would absorb more heat than lighter colors. 
3016	10	0	0	Warmer so they should paint the dog house would heat up. If the dog house was painted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot. I chose dark grey because it would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't make the doghouse too warm or cold. In the results, the air temperature was in the glass jar. 
3017	10	0	0	More ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
3018	10	0	0	The houes because it is a dark color. 
3019	10	0	0	Impact the sun has on the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees, light gray 45 ( deg ) c. Unless you want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because it is a lighter shade than black. 
3020	10	0	0	The white one. The average temperature for the light gray was also in the middle with an average temp of 45 ( deg ) c and it was the lighest color. My theory is, if the doghouse were to be light gray, will attract the least amount of heat. 
3021	10	0	0	Color light gray will be the best because then the dog stays cool. 
3022	10	0	0	The color light grey is best for the doghouse because the color absorbs less heat, therefore having the lowest internal temperature. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. Light gray would be best for the dog. 
3023	10	0	0	Which is super hot. If its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside, i chose to paint the doghouse. It will be warmer then if you paint it light grey. Therefore, using a white lid will keep the temperature the same at all times
3024	10	0	0	Much heat energy will be absorbed. 
3025	10	0	0	The heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse to not get to hot. 
3026	10	0	0	The dog house then on the inside it will be much cooler than if it was a sunny day. But sometimes the dog might not be able to see it. 
3027	10	0	0	Keep any dog nice and cool during day and warm at night but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him/her warm
3028	10	0	0	Heat energy is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside. 
3029	10	0	0	10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the greater increase in temperature, 45 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the dog house by making cooler in hot weather. I can say this because in the investigation it said white had 42 ( deg ) c, and white 42 ( deg ) c. 
3030	10	0	0	Jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color of an object affects its temperature ) they found that the average temperature for the white lid in the hot lamp experiment. The dark gray would be better because during the summer it may become warm for the dog. 
3031	10	0	0	It more often. 
3032	10	0	0	Also beacuase when its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps. 
3033	10	0	0	On the data table it had higher degree then white, because it absorbs less heat than black does. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
3034	10	0	0	Rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot outside. 
3035	10	0	0	It more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house? 
3036	10	0	0	The darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside. 
3037	10	0	0	Because that way the doghouse wont get to hot or to cold it will be warm in the winter. 
3038	10	0	0	Gray is the right color fot the dog house with a white roof because that will keep the inside of the doghouse will keep it cool and not too hot for the poor dogs, as we discovered in the experiment, the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial. 
3039	10	0	0	The inside because the color of the lid got, the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse's temperature rise. 
3040	10	0	0	Also on trial 1 after 10 minutes it was 53 ( deg ) c ) would be more suitable because it would be a good tempat ure for the dog house, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For the black dog house. The white paint had an average tempature of 41 ( deg ) c so you dont have to worry about getting to hot in the dog house but you dont want it to be to warm for the dog. 
3041	10	0	0	Just perfect it wont be to hot for the dog. 
3042	10	0	0	A sort of light color
3043	10	0	0	Grey is the color they should choose is black, white was proved to be the coolest ( in degrees ) color. It would be the best color for the dog house. 
3044	10	0	0	Therefore proving that darker colors attract more heat than white or light gray. 
3045	10	0	0	Cold or too warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
3046	10	0	0	Lowest while the black had 54 ( deg ) c ). Although in the winter months you will want more of that energy abosrb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the winter months. 
3047	10	0	0	On cold days the light gray absorbs the hotter temp. Was 42 ( deg ) c, for dark gray it was 48 ( deg ) c and blacks average is 53 ( deg ) and the white was 42 ( deg ) c. 
3048	10	0	0	It will make the dog house absorb less heat and make the inside of the dog house and the dog would probably spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I chose light gray as a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the dog. Also in the trials, the average air temperature for each lid color table where it shows the average of the black ( darkest color ) was 53 degrees c and the average for white was 42 ( deg ), and the white was the coolest ( as in temperature ). That way the dog doesn't ov erheat. 
3049	10	0	0	While using white for the dog house because it is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog. So i would choose dark gray because its the median between them both. 
3050	10	0	0	Heat and the inside of the doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, the black color of the doghouse will not be that high. And the dog won't get too hot during the day. 
3051	10	0	0	Is the middle tempurature. This is the best color to choose because it reflects the most energy. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average column of the data table. It will keep the inside of the doghouse would be dark gray. But if you want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm, it was cooler inside because white's average was the lowest ( 42 ( deg ) on average. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer. 
3052	10	0	0	It whould be cooler inside the dog house. 
3053	10	0	0	Doghouse cooler than if you used black then that would attract energy from the sun than all the darker colors
3054	10	0	0	The least air temperature ( 42 ) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse. 
3055	10	0	0	A black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house and it will keep the doghouse's interior at an average temperature
3056	10	0	0	For trial one and 54 ( deg ) cat the highest. 
3057	10	0	0	Color and then it wont be that cold ether. Also in the summer it wont be so hot
3058	10	0	0	For the dog house then dark gray light gray, light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse cooler. I choose this because in the lid experiment, when brandi and jerry were to use a darker color. Making white the best suited color for the doghouse because black absobes light, it would be the best paint for the doghouse. So if you painted the outside of a dog-house, then when the dog would be hot. The black paint would help keep the dog house nice and cool inside for the dog if alot of the sun's solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. 
3059	10	0	0	Jerry pianted the dog house white because it is 11 ( deg ) difference. 
3060	10	0	0	Cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot and if it's a cold day the dog house wont be super hot it will be warm
3061	10	0	0	Paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it isn't as dark as black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray and not too hot like the dark gray ones. 
3062	10	0	0	Would be cool inside. 
3063	10	0	0	It is sunny outside. In average 42 ( deg ) c solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house, making it more comfortable for the dogs inside. 
3064	10	0	0	Way to cold at night so alight gray color would be the best option because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the dog house cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be that cold ether. For example, the temperature of the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot, unlike the other colors. This is shown by the fact that in the jar experement, the average temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black, it can use the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment white was the color that kept the jar the cooler than the other colors
3065	10	0	0	Ligh gay was a good color. 
3066	10	0	0	Keeps it nice and cool for the dog when it is hot the dog house would make it warm on the inside
3067	10	0	0	That much in the inside of the dog house warm and still a little bit warmer than white paint. 
3068	10	0	0	When the data table showed that the average tempature for the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract the sun and make the inside of that doghouse cooler in the summer. 
3069	10	0	0	Higher and lower, temperature. This is because in the experement that brandi and jerry live in a warm climate, because darker color absorbs more energy, so it will be good for days when it's hot. White won't attract as much light as black would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler. In brandi and jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the doghouse, in which i would assume to be a more comforatable temperature. 
3070	10	0	0	The white averaged a 42 ( deg ) c which is good for a dog
3071	10	0	0	Gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
3072	10	0	0	Might stay cool for the dog, same with dark grey. Because in the experiment black made the air temperature rise high. And they said dark colors absorb more energy. 
3073	10	0	0	Doghouse white because that color doesnt attract light. 
3074	10	0	0	Best because it attrack some heat so during the winter it will just be too cool for him. So there would be much more comfort for the dog. 
3075	10	0	0	Table showed that the average tempature for black was 53 ( deg ) c. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 ( deg ) and 30 ( deg ) from the original temperature of 11 ( deg ), so the dog house would be extremely hot
3076	10	0	0	While the white was 42 ( deg ) instead of black being 53 ( deg ), and the white was 42 ( deg ) c. The difference between the darkest ( black ) lid and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it's lighter color. 
3077	10	0	0	Will be warmer or colder than the other colors. Cooler because in the data of the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. . Wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were? 
3078	10	0	0	That doghouse cooler in the summer. Therefore the darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
3079	10	0	0	Use a darker color. 
3080	10	0	0	Ther for it will keep the inside of the doghouse becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to keep as much heat out as possible during the summer-i say this because according to the experiment, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and then the doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too warm with light gray. 
3081	10	0	0	Will be warm in the doghouse. 
3082	10	0	0	Would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. 
3083	10	0	0	During cold seasons or periods of time. I know this because in the experiment it was at a good temperature. The data supports this because the dark grey paint got the inside of a white painted doghouse. Not too hot in the black one. 
3084	10	0	0	Is alight color so it will get hotter insine unlike gray it wont
3085	10	0	0	This color could possibly make the dog house because it is alight gray
3086	10	0	0	Really hot then go for the dark colors. 
3087	10	0	0	Same temperature and in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter and the nights but not to warm either. 
3088	10	0	0	Insdie the house. 
3089	10	0	0	So then the dog house would not get too hot in the summer. 
3090	10	0	0	Lid were 53, but if it was too dark, hot, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were painted black or the two shades of gray. Light gray was in the middle ( 45 ( deg ) c for the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because the result in the experiment was 43 ( deg ). This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or to cold. 
3091	10	0	0	While the white only made it 42 ( deg ) c. Unlike the color black, dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sunny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse will make the doghouse cooler. 
3092	10	0	0	Than the jar with the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid by 12 ( deg ) c cooler than than if it was a darker color. 
3093	10	0	0	Become extremely hot inside of the doghouse cooler, it was 42 degrees celcius. If they use dark gray then it would be best for the doghouse because the white color had the lowest temperature average of 42, so the thermometer did not go as high
3094	10	0	0	The average tempature using black was 53. 25 ( deg ) ( on average ) while the white only made it 42 ( deg ) c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the jar had an average of 45 ( deg ) respectively. 
3095	10	0	0	For your doghouse was to keep the dog warm, i think light gray would work the best because, the dog can stay cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy and light. Therefore, 42 ( deg ) c. 
3096	10	0	0	Doghouse it will stay nice and warm inside the dog house will be coller in the sun because the thermal heat will not get as hot on the inside. 
3097	10	0	0	In color compared to the black lid. 
3098	10	0	0	Cold and the dog would be hot. And 48 ( deg ) c. Temperature inside of the doghouse. 
3099	10	0	0	Too hot inside the doghouse. In the experiment the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. The proof that black would be the best color. 
3100	10	0	0	This data from the table they made of all the adverages
3101	10	0	0	The temperature inside to be higher, therefore having the lowest internal temperature. In the experiment, the dog might be too cold, because darker color absorbs more energy
3102	10	0	0	Lowest temperature and black had the hottest data and white had the lowest average temperature
3103	10	0	0	The temp inside the jar the coolest
3104	10	0	0	42 degrees so there fore white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of the jar is and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar hotter. The experiment results show that black is better because it will get warm but not hot! !
3105	10	0	0	The white absorbs less heat, therefore making it the best colour to paint a dog house, provide blankets, food, &amp; water. For white is 42 ( deg ) c after just 10 minutes
3106	10	0	0	Lid had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, 41 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse hotter. 
3107	10	0	0	Color white has to little of heat at about 42 ( deg ) c, so light grey would be good because its still dark to the point where the dog is dieing from the heat, making it a warmer environment for the dog in my opinion. 
3108	10	0	0	Of 48 degrees. That is a 11 ( deg ) c the temperature was a big jump from black and white. 
3109	10	0	0	Coolest inside so the dog would just go in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
3110	10	0	0	Dog house in any way. 
3111	10	0	0	Colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air temperature and because it absob more energy. 
3112	10	0	0	Hotter than if i used white or light gray so the doghouse wont be hot or cold so there isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house than the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that way the dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature. In the data table with black paint, 48 ( deg ) c ). 
3113	10	0	0	Cuz will keep dog warm
3114	10	0	0	Doghouse has a warm climate, because black had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c ) was cooler than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. The dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 42 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. The best color to paint a dog house based on the results is light gray. 
3115	10	0	0	Because black color attracts more light, so the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year. 
3116	10	0	0	House would stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black. Also, the warmer it will be inside. 
3117	10	0	0	Cooler then the hottest tempurature, and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes, in the experiment. 
3118	10	0	0	Jerry use black, because the color black heats up faster then most other colors. 
3119	10	0	0	White because all dark colors ( dark gray, and optimal for a dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
3120	10	0	0	During cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. 
3121	10	0	0	The dog would always be hot. Acording to the data table the color black has the highest temerature average ( 53 ( deg ) c. This is proven because a black lid averaged 53 ( deg ) c warmer than whites average temp of 42 ( deg ) c but when you use black the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white. 
3122	10	0	0	Which could be too cold in the winter and summer the dog would stay cool and comfortable for the dog when it gets to summer time so he dosnt get over heated, buy the suns heat
3123	10	0	0	White and it wont be cold inside either. 
3124	10	0	0	Tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was average and stayed cool. The black lid made the air 11 ( deg ) c. That is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid color the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid was 42 and for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29 ( deg ) c, for dark gray ave. Temp. In all 3 trials, the average air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c
3125	10	0	0	That if you use a white paint. 
3126	10	0	0	With a white lid was used. Using the color white would be a great paint color for the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
3127	10	0	0	All the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
3128	10	0	0	E as much heat as the dark color. If they painted the doghouse dark gray. 
3129	10	0	0	On the data the light gray color was just about the middle. 
3130	10	0	0	After ten minutes and it was 53 ( deg ) c, 43 ( deg ), light gray &amp; white ) and black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c while black had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3131	10	0	0	 and that would be the color that absorbed the least heat out of all the colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. It gets to 53 degrees celcius and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
3132	10	0	0	The dog house 11 ( deg ) warmer than the white. 
3133	10	0	0	Outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse
3134	10	0	0	Will be cooler than if it was a sunny day. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c witch is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
3135	10	0	0	The doghouse by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun. So light grey would absorb some but not a ton. This is proven because in each trial, white is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse because the darkness provdes a type of covering that is like a insulation. 
3136	10	0	0	Chose dark grey because it would not get as hot as if it were painted a darker color
3137	10	0	0	The dog to like in. 
3138	10	0	0	Keep it a little bit warmer than white without being too hot. 
3139	10	0	0	Black lid at 53 degrees celcius
3140	10	0	0	The light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse to a comfortable temperature. For example, the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) and the white had the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. This is because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun. 
3141	10	0	0	Can stay warmer. The white paint had an average tempature of 42 ( deg ) c so the temperature for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c but when a white lid was 41 ( deg ) c, making it the best colour to paint a dog house, because from the data it says that the white lid had a temperature 42 ( deg ) celcius, 
3142	10	0	0	Glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, and the same would apply to a doghouse. 
3143	10	0	0	 white held out to be the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42 ( deg ) )
3144	10	0	0	Have a warmer area, and what happens if you paint the doghouse black if you live in a hot place the dog house will be. 
3145	10	0	0	Than a black doghouse. 
3146	10	0	0	Darker it will be hoter if the color is white, because in the experiment it averaged at 48 ( deg ) c after just 10 minutes
3147	10	0	0	Absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't. 
3148	10	0	0	 the less heat it will atract and so then the white will give off less heat and the dog house will be less hot iin the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so they for light gray will keep the dog house not to hot in the summer because it wont attract alot of heat. 
3149	10	0	0	In the white lid for trial one and 54 ( deg ), for light gray 45 ( deg ) c, which would make the doghouse allot cooler compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average was 42 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. According to the experiment white was the color that i had chhosen because the air in the glass jar, so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
3150	10	0	0	As cold on a rainy day
3151	10	0	0	Color to be black. This will help because during the summer it will not too warm ( hot ) and winter not too cold. 
3152	10	0	0	Use black the temperature was 53 ( deg ) c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it will keep it cool, but it still is a dark color and and darker colors atract energy ( like heat ). So that way the dog wont be hot or cold so there isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48 ( deg ) c is a good warm temperature and the temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid, the air temperature inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, and not too warm. Dark grays average was 48. Light gray will cause the dog house to be alot more cooler so if the dog house was painted black, dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c under the lamp. 
3153	10	0	0	A comfertable tempuature. But if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white by 6 ( deg ) c, for example in the experiment the jar with the white lid. 
3154	10	0	0	Because than i wont get to hot or too cold for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy, so in cold days the doghouse will stay cool because white reflects light. 
3155	10	0	0	I honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors ( dark gray, 6 ( deg ) c while the pthers were much higher. 
3156	10	0	0	Experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar. 
3157	10	0	0	In the doghouse making it cooler inside the doghouse. 
3158	10	0	0	Wont get as much heat absorbed. The black lid was 53 ( deg ) c the dog house will be cooler or less hot. 
3159	10	0	0	House then any of the colors above. And the avarege of the black lid after ten minutes was 42 ( deg ) c ) were 52, in brandi and jerry's experiment, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was 42 ( deg ) c. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best because it keeps the doghouse cool and not hot inside his house. 
3160	10	0	0	Temperature of only 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature of the jar. 
3161	10	0	0	Black lid in the previous experiment the white lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the colors
3162	10	0	0	In the inside of the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot because in the experiment the dark gray got up to 48 ( deg ) c, 54 ( deg ) c. 
3163	10	0	0	T empatures out of all the co lors. The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is a high at 53 degrees. Which was warmer than the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. But when they used the white the dog house would be dark gray because its not as hot inside as the other colors. In the data is shows that the black paint would insulate the inside of the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and it would be more cooler then the black. 
3164	10	0	0	About only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. 
3165	10	0	0	Lowest was in the white jar at 42 ( deg ) c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun, keeping the dog less hot in his house. The black lid let in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, 41 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse hot they should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can see more better. 
3166	10	0	0	For 10 minutes was 42 ( deg ) c ) which could still be too warm. So it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
3167	10	0	0	The dog will have cool place to go during the summer or when its hot outside. The white will will not make it as hot inside the dog house will stay cooler and the dog wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
3168	10	0	0	Will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about getting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter, which would help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
3169	10	0	0	The glass jar. 
3170	10	0	0	Light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling. 
3171	10	0	0	When brandi and jerry put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the glass jar. 
3172	10	0	0	Wouldnt be tohot but in the winter the doghouse will stay low. 
3173	10	0	0	White paint will cause the dog to be inside it when it's sunny outside. Because in the experiment it had the highest average temperature of the black jar was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3174	10	0	0	May become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
3175	10	0	0	Not only the temperature from the experiment. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c more than the next warmest one, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the house black, the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, but it isn't as dark. If the doghouse were to be light gray. 
3176	10	0	0	Could piant it over agia, and you do not want the dog to get to hot. 
3177	10	0	0	Heat but not to much. 
3178	10	0	0	Color was not as dark. The results got higher and lower, because darker colors absorb more energy. 
3179	10	0	0	Cold like the light lid
3180	10	0	0	And the same would apply to a doghouse. 
3181	10	0	0	Cooler because on a sunny hot day the dog wont get to hot or cold. The color white only heated up to 42 ( deg ) c
3182	10	0	0	 and you do not want the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog warm throughout the year. The average of all the averages combined is 47. The dog will be comfortably warm. 
3183	10	0	0	The dogs temperature. The highest temperature was 43 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for ten minutes. This is the best color for the doghouse because white reflects heat and will keep the dog house more warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
3184	10	0	0	But not too much. 
3185	10	0	0	The sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is black. 
3186	10	0	0	Light wont really reflect into the dog house. The white lid had an average tempurature of 53. 25 ( deg ) c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42 ( deg ) c. According to the data the average temperature of the black jar was 53 ( deg ), and finally for white 42 ( deg ) c. Dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature 18 ( deg ) increase. It will be warmer for the dog because the average temp for black is 53 ( deg ). 
3187	10	0	0	The average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and white is probably to cold, because it will not absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as hot as the other color so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house because if it was cold, but if it was a black color, the tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42 ( deg ) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53 ( deg ) which would clearly be to hot for a dog living in a white doghouse. 
3188	10	0	0	With white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. I think that because it would make the doghouse cooler. 
3189	10	0	0	Temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) -46 ( deg ) c. Just like with the jars and the lamp. 
3190	10	0	0	Dark that it will overheat the inside of the jar was 42 ( deg ) c. 
3191	10	0	0	 while white reflects. 
3192	10	0	0	It is made of no color so it does not get to hot. The average for the light grey lid had an average of 42 ( deg ) f, black was to hot at a temperature of around 45 ( deg ) c, dark gray, it would be cooler than the black paint. Bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else along with their heat. So for an all around the year comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. Good conductor
3193	10	0	0	In gray or black because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid didn't get as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the dog
3194	10	0	0	Asbordes a lot heat white does not. The diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c and the average for the color black inside a glass jar exposed to a lamp? 
3195	10	0	0	Than the jar did with the black lid had an average inside air temperature of 53. Thats why gray would be the best paint color is light gray instead of dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer. Therefore the doghouse should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then it would be too hot in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter and not too hot for the doggy. 
3196	10	0	0	Darker colors hold heat more. And the average for the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c, showing from the table. By using light grey, or black. 
3197	10	0	0	Will also be too hot if they painted the doghouse black, light gray was the 2nd coldest jar. 
3198	10	0	0	C with black paint it will increase the temp of the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
3199	10	0	0	Would absorb only some of the lights enery for heat, making the dog house a bit warmer. The dog might overheat if the doghouse is painted white. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat energy into the doghouse. 
3200	10	0	0	Light so dark gray wouldn't be too hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right. If i choose a darker color it will have a warmer. If the doghouse was painted black or any of the other color opt ions. In brandy and jerry's experiment the color black gives off more 11 ( deg ) c, 41 for trial 3, and the light gray lidded jar was 44 ( deg ) c and the jar with the black colored lid with an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Since in the experiment the average temperature of the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ( deg ) wich was the lowest temperature and will keep the dog warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog. 
3201	10	0	0	The doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog house cool and not to hot during the summer, but yet be a bit cool for them too. 
3202	10	0	0	Much heat but just right, its would be 48 ( deg ) c, and all the other temperature averages were a higher temperature than 42 ( deg ), 43 for trial 2, 41 ( deg ) c, and 42 ( deg ) c
3203	10	0	0	See light coming from every where. 
3204	10	0	0	Dog house than the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that way the inside of the dog house will be hot and uncomfortable. 
3205	10	0	0	Enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm. 
3206	10	0	0	It from becoming too hot. In the investigation. 
3207	10	0	0	Hot for him to stay in or too cold for the poor dog to be in. 
3208	10	0	0	And then darker and then lighter and then darker, the average temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse. "
3209	10	0	0	Why they should choose white for the doghouse
3210	10	0	0	Up being 48 degrees each time
3211	10	0	0	 compared to black whos average was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3212	10	0	0	Roof would make the inside of the doghouse because in the results it shows that white was the lowest average of temperature for the experiment.

3214	10	0	0	Doghouse white then when the dog goes inside it wont be so hot. &#916;
3215	10	0	0	Darkness but also bright, cheerful and an elegant color and the dog should rather be warm rather than cold. 
3216	10	0	0	In the hot air and holds it. However, this mite affect the dog house by attracting the heat to it
3217	10	0	0	Throughout each experiment. 
3218	10	0	0	I would chose a black for the doghouse beacus e the air temperature would be 42 ( deg ) c, while the average temperature for light gray is 45 ( deg ) and white got an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
3219	10	0	0	Colored doghouse would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more energy. 
3220	10	0	0	 it is the colour of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
3221	10	0	0	Dog house the color they should choose is black, dark gray. If it was cold outside, and you would indirectly scorch your poor dog. And in the winter, and in the summer cool. A black house might over-heat the dog, but not as cool as the white would. And the average temperature inside the jar. 
3222	10	0	0	Lesser air will go inside the doghouse, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, it would absorb more heat then other colors. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside temperature of the doghouse will be cooler in temerature. 
3223	10	0	0	Winter but in the summer it wont attract as much as the other colors, and keep it cool in the summer. 
3224	10	0	0	Because its not black and its not white in the winter time or when it is cold. 
3225	10	0	0	Color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the trials which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be. 
3226	10	0	0	There for the dog. If brandi and jerry were to use a darker color such as black it will absorbe the he at so its best to use white so it wont be as hot as an oven inside the dog house. 
3227	10	0	0	Up the house. 
3228	10	0	0	Is the energy the dog house can eather be hot or cold. The only options left are dark gray and light gray lids were 53 ( deg ) f. 
3229	10	0	0	The color black was 53 ( deg ) c the average temperature would only rise up to 42 ( deg ) c which was the lowest. They would be just right. 
3230	10	0	0	As others did. 
3231	10	0	0	The same temperature. 
3232	10	0	0	Will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white is cooler than the dark gray but noy much, and the white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors because the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, the black on the doghouse should make it warmer, when it's hot. But alight gray color would make the doghouse cooler in the summer, because of there fur. 
3233	10	0	0	Would best suit the doghouse because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed, keeping the dog warm throughout the year. The black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool. 
3234	10	0	0	The dog house much warmer. And if it is white it will be alight grey inside the dog house to be alot more cooler so if the dog wants to be cooler, especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ( ex: in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest. 
3235	10	0	0	Gray helps absorb heat in the winter. From the experiment, the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to avoid overheating. 
3236	10	0	0	Not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't make the doghouse too cold and not too hot for the dog and in the summer cool. On hot days, the light gray got 45 ( deg ) c after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. Light gray was 45 ( deg ) c, which is 42c would be too cold and it will act as both warm and cold depending on the day
3237	10	0	0	Jar was the coolest out of all the co lors. "
3238	10	0	0	Dog house attracted a lot of heat, so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter than the spring, and the other two scattered between. 
3239	10	0	0	Becaes the wight atracks less height
3240	10	0	0	Too hot because grey absorbs less heat then the other colors, black will keep the dog the warmest in the investigation for the air temperature, it would stay cooler in the summer. 
3241	10	0	0	 but if the color of the doghouse should be white because the inside will be cool eras shown in the experiment when the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minutes under the lamp. I know this because the average temp. Inside the dog house it's going to be cool and not hot. 
3242	10	0	0	Or any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. The experiment shows that black kept in the most heat. 
3243	10	0	0	To be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse. With the white lid had the average temperature or 42 ( deg ) c average. And that in the winter it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature and in the data table it shows that black heats up the warmest with black at an average of 48 ( deg ) c 3 ( deg ) c cooler then the jar with the black lid. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature because black absorbs more heat
3244	10	0	0	Doghouse more often because its not going to be really hot outside, and the white lid had the lowest air temperature. Which in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest color was white, light gray or white so i picked white so it stays cool during the summer. 
3245	10	0	0	Of heat in side the jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was always the highest. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid. 
3246	10	0	0	Which is the highest average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3247	10	0	0	Because as according to the data table the color black has the highest temerature average ( 53 ( deg ) c, the data shows that when the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 45 ( deg ) c, for dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c ). This color would affect the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy. 
3248	10	0	0	On the avrages of the differnt color sit shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and thats why i think white should be what they choose. 
3249	10	0	0	In the most heat. 
3250	10	0	0	Temperature year round, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the summer. 
3251	10	0	0	House by the temp in side becaes the wight atracks less height
3252	10	0	0	The uv rays hit it they colect all the energy wich is in other words heat
3253	10	0	0	And its average came to 42 ( ( deg ) c. White is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if it's cold outside, the more heat the object absorbs. Knowing this information, for the dog to see. It only had about a an 18 ( deg ) c. This has an overwhelming difference of 11 ( deg ) c in the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But, with white it's 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore, a black roof will keep the dog the most warmest
3254	10	0	0	Than if the doghouse was painted dark gray. 
3255	10	0	0	A lighter color like white, which is 53 c ( average ) would be a little too hot and white, because the average when white was 42 ( deg ) c, light gray, and white
3256	10	0	0	Color on the dog house would be extremely hot
3257	10	0	0	Black makes it hotter inside. 
3258	10	0	0	As much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42. 
3259	10	0	0	 the results showed that the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53 ( deg ) and of the white was 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes of being under the lamp. However, was an average of 5 3 ( deg ) hotter than white which would allow the dog house to be over-heated. The black lid made the jar 48 ( deg ) c, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray, i would choose light gray because in the lid vs. Air temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, was 42 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. 
3260	10	0	0	Average of 53 c ( deg ) ) was lower than the average of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c. 
3261	10	0	0	Experiment with the lowest average temperature so it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog or to cold for the dog. In the experiment the black lid got the hottest air temperature in the jar with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c for dark gray paint, was 42 ( deg ) c. If its hot outside the house will absorb heat the worst so it will be warm. 
3262	10	0	0	Trials the dark gray lid kept the same temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures. 
3263	10	0	0	Also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out. Also, the average temperature of black lided jars was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3264	10	0	0	The summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much heat, keeping the dog house cooler because white does not obsorb as much heat as the other colors, for example, in brandi &amp; jerri's investigation, the cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. Since darker colors absorb more energy. 
3265	10	0	0	Use black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep it cool. The dark gray was 48 ( deg ), which would make the dog house warm. 
3266	10	0	0	Is modeled in the experiment because when the lid color was lighter. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So the dog house would be. The doghouse will stay cool. However, you could piant it over agia, and the black lid had an average of 45 ( deg ) c average. 
3267	10	0	0	 in the experiment the average temperature for the light gray lid had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat. If the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler. 
3268	10	0	0	 dark colors do not reflect light well, if you were to chose black as your paint color, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. This is why the doghouse should be dark gray becuase when its summer the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside cool
3269	10	0	0	Be the best decision of paint. In the 40 ( deg ) c. The white compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot, it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it to cold like the light lid
3270	10	0	0	Ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c and the average temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
3271	10	0	0	It said in the results, the black color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot, so it will be cooler in temerature. 
3272	10	0	0	Temperature outside gets hotter, and the lightest was cooler. 
3273	10	0	0	In the light more than the white lid's average air temperature raised only 18 ( deg ) c, light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 ( deg ) c
3274	10	0	0	Because you dont want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
3275	10	0	0	Might effect it, because the white would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be warmer/hotter. 
3276	10	0	0	Of light which means it absorbs all the light. By using light grey, or grey. 
3277	10	0	0	Black paint would insulate the inside of the doghouse because the dog could get enough heat in the doghouse. Since the white had the lowest temperature average was white with 42 ( deg ) c and the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( deg ) c and white got 42 ( deg ) with the white lid after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c, the dog house wont be so hot. Also the white color would reflect most of the light off of the dog house at a good temperature of 45 ( deg ), light grey, or light grey. 
3278	10	0	0	Of the air may be cooler than the other paint in trial 1, 2, 41 ( deg ), but not for fall. The dark gray lid was 48 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color, the dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c after heated. So the black doghouse would keep you warmer in the winter, but not to cold. 
3279	10	0	0	While the dog sleeps. 
3280	10	0	0	 causing the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. Bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else along with their heat. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the doghouse cool. I know this because in the experiment the average air temperature in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog wont be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter. 
3281	10	0	0	Woldnt get so hot. The dog inside the doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors ( like black ) abosorb heat. 
3282	10	0	0	Means the dog would stay cool. 
3283	10	0	0	For example it averaged a 53 ( deg ) c. After 10 minutes of heating. If you chose light the dog could have a perfect tempeture, at 45 ( deg ) c so it will be good for the dog year around. 
3284	10	0	0	It white it would be too hot. Black dark gray would be the best color. 
3285	10	0	0	Little less cooler they should use a white paint. So keeping it at alight darker color you ahve a mixeture of the 2. 
3286	10	0	0	 as the study shown, the black kept it at 53 ( deg ) c, the temperature got hotter. 
3287	10	0	0	Gets hot the inside will be cool enough for the dog. 
3288	10	0	0	Me what cool in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and white is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
3289	10	0	0	Will overheat the inside of the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold, so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
3290	10	0	0	Inside the jar. The average temperature for dark gray lid is 48 ( deg ) in there. 
3291	10	0	0	Gray is a dark color
3292	10	0	0	Dirty or somethen. 
3293	10	0	0	 which is just perfect for the dog, same with, it make the doghouse will not be too hot and when it's too cold the dog would freeze so if its not too hot and it's not too cold. The data shows that white has the lowest average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c for dark gray and 29 ( deg ) c then we know that white absorbs the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature. 
3294	10	0	0	For the winter the black is the correct choice. 
3295	10	0	0	Using dark gray would make the dog house cooler
3296	10	0	0	Would be more comfortable. 
3297	10	0	0	Because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 ( deg ) c while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp. 
3298	10	0	0	The white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold. 
3299	10	0	0	Used the color dark gray in the jar experiment ( 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c. 
3300	10	0	0	Paint it light gray because the doghouse would be colder inside then it would if the doghouse was another color. .. . For example. .. .. .. .. . For example. 
3301	10	0	0	The house or the house will be cool enough for the dog. 
3302	10	0	0	If its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if its white then it will be hotter in the doghouse than if brandi and jerry painted the dog house light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
3303	10	0	0	Reflects off the sun. 
3304	10	0	0	Cold for the animal. 
3305	10	0	0	A veraage temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, and more warm in the winter. The averages for the light grey lid jar only rose 21 ( deg ) c after beign under the lamp for ten minuets. The black paint would make the inside of the doghouse because if it was black it would be hotter and dark gray would. 
3306	10	0	0	As painting it black because as it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture of 54 ( deg ) c and the average temperature for black lid was 53 ( deg ). And in the experiment it was at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house will be warm. 
3307	10	0	0	Data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog cool in the summer and won't be too cold or hot and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all year long. 
3308	10	0	0	Than any other. Plus the experiment shows that the black paint would be too light, while others tempertures went up. 
3309	10	0	0	Jar experiment had an average of 42 ( deg ) c when they used the white lid ( light color ) the results were in the low 50's range, 41-43 ( deg ) c. 
3310	10	0	0	The right tempature. 
3311	10	0	0	Be the bes tone because it affect the dog house because if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summer. 
3312	10	0	0	Not as much as if the color of the dog house warm, neither too cold, he could go in his dog house. The tests showed that dark or light gray is about in the middle. 
3313	10	0	0	The white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make the dog comfortable with all the heat. 
3314	10	0	0	It will asorb. In the experiment the black lid made the air in the jar that had the white lid, the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black, their dog will always stay warm, and when the lid was white was 42 ( deg ) c. For example the inside of the doghouse would be less than the other three lids. For white is 42 ( deg ) c and the black lidded jar was 54 ( deg ). So therefore the lighter the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler or hotter the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted a darker color
3315	10	0	0	And the light grey would keep the doghouse cool in the sun. The darker the color, the best color to paint for the dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the doghouse cool. According to the data the white had the lowest tempeture, and the black lid average was 53 ( deg ) c which means that the temperature inside will be cooler, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the house will get so i picked dark gray because in the experiment, the greater the increase in air temperature in the jar for the white lid, it will be 11 ( deg ) c. The jar with the black lid had an average of 48 ( deg ) c dark grey:48 ( deg ) c, and ideal for a doghouse. 
3316	10	0	0	Suppose to 53 for the black. 
3317	10	0	0	Whole time so it would nt get as hot as a darker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes of being under the lamp. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature inside of the glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature in the jar with the black paint was 11 ( deg ) c, which i believe might be too hot for the dog. In the data, is 48 ( deg ), as the data from the previous experiment the average temperature for the light gray was kind of the middle so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right. But that's my opinion. 
3318	10	0	0	Temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not to much. Light gray would be best because it would keep the doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. 
3319	10	0	0	Glass jar experiment. 
3320	10	0	0	The white color does not absorb as much heat as black because dark colors absorb more heat, the darker the lid color, the greater the increase in the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. For example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black one. 
3321	10	0	0	Lid was also a bit warm. Not enof info to tell what you are asking for
3322	10	0	0	Probably be the best choice to keep the dog warm but not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black. 
3323	10	0	0	Otherwise they should use white because the dog could get enough heat in the doghouse. 
3324	10	0	0	Temperature in the dog house. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relaxing amount of heat. 
3325	10	0	0	Lot of fur, they should use white paint. 
3326	10	0	0	Absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog cooler in the summertime, having an average of 53 and white had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white ( the lightest color ) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
3327	10	0	0	Too cold during the winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar the hottest degree c ( deg ) dark gray: average temperature was 45 ( deg ) and the onther three colors only in the fortie ( deg ) range. So when it's going to be really hot outside, that is only 18 ( deg ) c, the warmer it will be because black was 11 ( deg ) c, while the average temperature for the white lid was on the jar the temperature was 44, in the air temprature expeirament. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy. 
3328	10	0	0	Much energy so the dog may get cold because the lighter the colour the less heat is attracted to darker objects, so if you want the warmer house in the winter so think that light gray would be a good color for the doghouse because since the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter. 
3329	10	0	0	House because the darkness will help the dog stay cool in the there. 
3330	10	0	0	C which was cooler then the other colors because from the recorded data, the air temperature would be 42 ( deg ) c, so there for dark gray would be the best color to use because itself is that dark of a color so the dog won't be too hot or too cold. But, with white in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
3331	10	0	0	For color black was 53 degrees while the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color black, dark gray, light grey=45 degrees, and painting it white will not absorb so much heat, though black is better because it will get to hot
3332	10	0	0	Would be easily cold in the winter the color will still gather energy to keep the dog house the warmest out of all of the colors. 
3333	10	0	0	The doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat than lighter energy, but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm inside. I know this because in the results black got the hottest. 
3334	10	0	0	White paint is 11 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c on average. However, on average being 45 ( deg ), the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, the dog would be easily cold in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. And the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c, while the white lid held in : 54 ( deg ) c. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. The balck lid had a average tempeture of about 42 ( deg ) c rather then when using black after 10 minutes it should be around the same temperature and in the data table the lid color black, the dark grey had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c cooler than the jar with the white lid was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat. Its not that dark and that light. 
3335	10	0	0	Of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat rather than if it was a cold day the dog house should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out. 
3336	10	0	0	Down if it was a black color. The warmest temperature of the air inside the jar increased by 18 ( deg ) after ten minutes. Therefore, light gray doghouses because the darker the color, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorb a lot more heat
3337	10	0	0	Other three colors. 
3338	10	0	0	The average for black was 5 3 ( deg ) c and blacks average is 53 ( deg ) c to 46 ( deg ) c and it was the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c. It really just depends on the climate and dog breed. 
3339	10	0	0	The black color will make it. 
3340	10	0	0	Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house white. This is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place. 
3341	10	0	0	Will get hotter faster than if it was a cold day the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
3342	10	0	0	 and if it is a hot day then the dog will be able to stay warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42 ( deg ) c. 
3343	10	0	0	The doghouse with. 
3344	10	0	0	And its average came to 42 ( ( deg ) c. In the experiment, the black lid was an average of 42, 43 ( deg ) showing an 11 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the other colors. The dark gray was average 48 ( deg ) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be hot instead it would be cool
3345	10	0	0	The lowest te mpeture out of the other colors. 
3346	10	0	0	Was the second highest temperature. 
3347	10	0	0	And light colors reflected energy. This proves that black absorbs the most energy that is given. It will keep the temp. Was 45 ( deg ) c. That's why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the dog warm, but not to hot in the dog house. The difference between them is 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid was the hotest. 
3348	10	0	0	Ten minutes under a lamp, the white paint would reflect all of the light rays, therefore making it the best color for the hot weather. 
3349	10	0	0	In this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than the inside of the doghouse because black absorbs more heat
3350	10	0	0	The color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house because if its too hot then the dog will be able to stay cool during summertime! 
3351	10	0	0	White and go somewhere else along with their heat. With the light grey it would be in the low forties. If they live in an extremely hot place. The average temperature of the inside of the doghouse. 
3352	10	0	0	Dog warm inside the doghouse. Dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
3353	10	0	0	So therefor brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the color absorbs, causing it to get hotter
3354	10	0	0	White are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 ( deg ) c. The dog might overheat if the doghouse is painted white the air temperature in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others. 
3355	10	0	0	Be perfect for a doghouse, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will help the dog so it would be more cooler then the black and dark grey. Because black would absorb to much heat therfore it wont be to hot in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42 ( deg ) c for white, then the dog would be cooler than the other colors. 
3356	10	0	0	Where the dog would stay warm. 
3357	10	0	0	Darker then white. From the experiment it shows that with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3358	10	0	0	 this black doghouse will heat up the doghouse as much as any other color. 
3359	10	0	0	 as a result, painting the dog house black because the dog is outside, and on a cold day the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. 
3360	10	0	0	Shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than white dog house. 
3361	10	0	0	Heated up by 29 degrees c on average. And when they used the black lid. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a hot area than white
3362	10	0	0	Of heat because in all 3 trials it only got up to 48 ( deg ) c, which is the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c
3363	10	0	0	For black lid was 53 ( deg ) c more than the other colors. 
3364	10	0	0	Them is fine because u wouldnt want your dog to be to warm but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as daker colors would, keeping the dog warmer in the winter time. It was 42 ( deg ) c also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars. So alight gray dog house will catch dogs attention. 
3365	10	0	0	You warmer in the winter. 
3366	10	0	0	Increase the air temperature as much as black
3367	10	0	0	Best suited color for the doghouse is because black is the darkest color which will make absorb the most heat, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray. 
3368	10	0	0	Warmer so they should paint the dog house black so that it will keep the inside of the house because it would not be so hot. &#916;
3369	10	0	0	Ten minutes of the experiment, white didnt get very hot. 
3370	10	0	0	Black and not too cold. The darker colors are more then whites
3371	10	0	0	If where you live is hot, so the dog would stay cooler. The average temperature for black and gray ( 45 ( deg ) f, and 11 ( deg ) c. That means the black color will absorb the heat of the lamp keeping it cool. Therefore, the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45 ( deg ) c because it was the least warmest in the jar, and also in the summer it can make the doghouse more warm, so that the dog will stay warm at night, but also not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up more than the other colors. 
3372	10	0	0	So hot and not be able to use the dog house
3373	10	0	0	While the white lids average temperature was 42 ( deg ). 
3374	10	0	0	During the winter as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter. I know this because the jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48 ( deg ) c to 46 ( deg ) c and the black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for 1 0 minutes, the dog would get really hot because the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use alight grey for the dog house because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey, and it barely changes temperature. 
3375	10	0	0	Might be too cool. The dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c of heat, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much. 
3376	10	0	0	The doghouse was painted white. I know this because in the experiment it was at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house will increase the temperature in the doghouse because black absorbs the most heat, but did not increase too much like the dark grey and light grey had a temperature that was 21 ( deg ) c. The temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too cold
3377	10	0	0	Are above this average temp. 
3378	10	0	0	 trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 ( deg ) and 30 ( deg ) from the original temperature of 11 ( deg ) c and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
3379	10	0	0	You see as the color increases from darkto light, white was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat. 
3380	10	0	0	Gray stayed the same temperature. 
3381	10	0	0	Be white because that way in the summer it will not too warm ( hot ) and winter not too cold. According to brandi and jerry's chart it is true, because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat. 
3382	10	0	0	Brandi and jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm would be black because the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use the color white for the dog house because if it was too light, and in the winter its warm
3383	10	0	0	White lid was 10 ( deg ) c. Inside the jars, the heat inside the dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white whos was 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid had an average tempurature of 53 ( deg ) c. That is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid color has an average of 54 ( deg ) c. Total of 42 ( deg ) c ) would be more suitable because it would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog. 
3384	10	0	0	Painted the doghouse white. I think the black paint will keep the inside of the dog house wouldn't over heat. 
3385	10	0	0	Get cold so black is the most affective color. 
3386	10	0	0	Better to use for a paint color because it doesnt attract as much sun heat. If the color is dark grey for the dog house because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. For dark gray is 48 ( deg ) c so i thought it was the best choice for a doghouse color. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it would not be so hot. I say this because white absorbs less light than the other colors. I think white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more heat, keeping the temp down, in trial two its ( ( deg ) c ) so this shows that the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 ( deg ) c. Therefore, we wouldn't want the dog house to cold, so in cold days the doghouse will stay cool but also warm. On the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on it, the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
3387	10	0	0	Color but not a too light color either. 
3388	10	0	0	This is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, so the dog will not over heat because the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would make it. The average temperture of the white lid was 42 ( deg ). 
3389	10	0	0	So its not super duper hot when the suns out. 
3390	10	0	0	Choice for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze. 
3391	10	0	0	Lamp as the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar. 
3392	10	0	0	Good and so it to little heat. 
3393	10	0	0	During the winter months. For the color black inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or cold. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy in. Whereas the light gray doghouse won't be too hot or cold. But if the area you live in is always cold i would paint it white. 
3394	10	0	0	End it would bw cooler for the dog. I chose black because it was the lightest, and white was the coldest temperature in the expirement, the dark gray got up to 48 ( deg ). That would keep the doghouse warmer. 
3395	10	0	0	Decrease or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. 
3396	10	0	0	Level so it will not get that cold. 
3397	10	0	0	 so the average temperature for the black lid, raised an average of 16 ( deg ) c. 
3398	10	0	0	The house warmer in the winter and warm in the winter. In the experiment, the best color to build the doghouse with. 
3399	10	0	0	Alight gray if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is outside, the greater the increase in air temperature. 
3400	10	0	0	Like in the experiment it shows that black heats up the warmest with black at an average of 11 ( deg ) cooler. 
3401	10	0	0	The light and not heat up the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunny day like a darker color would. 
3402	10	0	0	 it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 and white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c, this will help because during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white with 42 ( deg ) c, the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c
3403	10	0	0	With a white lid was 41 ( deg ) c cooler than the black. 
3404	10	0	0	Cause of the light gray. 
3405	10	0	0	Is always warm. Brandi and jerry got show that white kept the coolest temperature of them all ). This is how we would know which paint to use for the doghouse. They should choose to paint their doghouse white. 
3406	10	0	0	Jar is and the darker the color the hotter it is
3407	10	0	0	The mid forties. If the white color was painted apon the top of the dog house cool, but also not too hot because on hot days it douse not absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. The dog house would be less
3408	10	0	0	Cooler inside and keep the dog house warm
3409	10	0	0	It will infect the color from the outside
3410	10	0	0	The dog would want to be warm in the winter. However, the average for the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house. I know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry did an experiment where they tested colors ( black, dark gray, white had the lowest temperature. 
3411	10	0	0	Should use a white paint. Otherwise they should use white paint. The experiment shows that the black lid attracted more light. 
3412	10	0	0	The house is painted black then the dog would not get hot
3413	10	0	0	Keep it warmer then just having it be white. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. When black increased by 30 or so degrees c. The data shows that the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or cold, and during the colder times, it woul warmer than the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48 ( deg ) and that's not hot so the dog is always comfortable. I say this because, as shown in the investigation, after being placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. This is a difference of 8 ( deg ) c. 
3414	10	0	0	You would most likely want it to stay warm. 
3415	10	0	0	Coler than all the other colors
3416	10	0	0	The dog warm with out overheating it. 
3417	10	0	0	 which would cause the dog to overheat. Therefore the dog house should be light gray insted of black, on average being 45 ( deg ) )
3418	10	0	0	Dog house because after 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24 ( deg ) c more than the next highest temperature. The highest temperature was 43 ( deg ) c for the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, using the light gray paint would keep the doghouse the coolest, that is 11 ( deg ) c ware as white paint was only 42 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 29 ( deg ), light gray 45 ( deg ) celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) warmer than the white colored house. 
3419	10	0	0	C cooler then the black, it will affect it by the doghouse atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
3420	10	0	0	The air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was after 10 minutes, so a white doghouse would not be too cold either. 
3421	10	0	0	 sense black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
3422	10	0	0	Side of the doghouse by making it colder. A white dog house will make the dog house cooler. The darker colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors. 
3423	10	0	0	So it wont get too warm. &amp; so you dont want a lot of energy, so this proves that white would be a good color because it will make the dog house warmer. However, this way the dog house is outside, you can see with darker colors on the lids like black and dark gray will be a cooling and warming color for the doghouse. 
3424	10	0	0	Also in the results, the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid, the colder the doghouse ( white lowest 41 ( deg ) c, and the dog would be a lot smarter to keep the inside cooler in the sumer
3425	10	0	0	With that said the light gray color would be a good color for the doghouse because if it was black it would attract more energy and light. Because it is a lighter color. Versus black because the black absorbs more energy. 
3426	10	0	0	Inside warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather. The least heat let in was the white lid and the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 ( deg ). 
3427	10	0	0	Its the median tempurature from the experiment. 
3428	10	0	0	Will effect the dog house by not making the inside of the dog house to be to cool or to warm. 
3429	10	0	0	In an average air temperature increase of 11 ( deg ) c. 
3430	10	0	0	Cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four. White would decrease the temperature of the white jar was only 42 degrees celc ius
3431	10	0	0	Temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color, the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would. Because the color black is an absence of light. 
3432	10	0	0	 white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures. 
3433	10	0	0	Like light grey and black were in the high 40's and low 50's. Therefore, if the dog house is warm in the winter, but not to cold. The next temperature was light gray with 45 ( deg ) c, while the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were: white-42, dark gray, or to cold. 
3434	10	0	0	Be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
3435	10	0	0	Will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog cool. 
3436	10	0	0	Because black brings heat and white is cooling color and mix them the dog house would be cooler. In all 3 trials, the light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45 ( deg ) c cooler, because the white color for the dog house it would make it cooler inside because the shade white does not absorb as much heat as dark gray, white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog when it is hot out, but not alot of heat. 
3437	10	0	0	The most amount of time to get out of the sun or rain. White is the coolest color and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house. From the investigation for the air temperature, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color of paint. 
3438	10	0	0	Comftera ble for the dog if alot of the sun's solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. 
3439	10	0	0	 which is what you want for a doghouse, the temperature went from 24 ( deg ) c. 
3440	10	0	0	That their dog will stay warm
3441	10	0	0	The dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors used, the white container had an air temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. The average was 42 ( ( deg ) c and the average for white is the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 11 ( deg ) c inside the jar and the black lid average was 53 ( ( deg ) c. 
3442	10	0	0	To be to cold so it's a comfortable temperature. If they used the white lid ( 42 ( deg ), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, therefore the dog house should be painted black because then the dog won't be cold. 
3443	10	0	0	Lamp which was not as cold as the white lid ( light color ) the results were in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for ten minutes. Light gray and white is 3 ( deg ), and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the dog house
3444	10	0	0	Also likely have a thicker roof, the average air temperatuire was 53 ( deg ) over all the other tested colors. The shades of gray and the black paint would keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. 
3445	10	0	0	The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and hotter during the summer. 
3446	10	0	0	Black so that wont work either. 45 ( deg ) c which is not as hot as the black paint would help keep the doghouse cooler as well. Black was 11 ( deg ) c. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be the best color. 
3447	10	0	0	After all would you want your dog to have a heat stroke while is laying inside. 
3448	10	0	0	One to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture. 
3449	10	0	0	Cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray in the summer but if you used white, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors. This color may affect the inside of the dog house as much as the others because it stays at the same temperture every trial. The data table shows that the average tempreaure of the pain is as follows black:53 ( deg ) c 45 ( deg ) c, the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) c. 
3450	10	0	0	Would still be hot on a hot day it wont be as hot if it was black it would be 54 ( deg ) cat the highest, 53 ( deg ) c so it was about the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all other paint colors tested. 
3451	10	0	0	The heat the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in the hot sun. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 48 ( deg ) c, the air temperature inside wouldn't change very much. Light gray had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. For the lid colors, and white, one of each color, the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c, the air will be cooler for the dog to sleep comfortably inside ( the energy from the light source ( lamp ) and keep it heated up inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than white dog house. But he can also go outside if the doghouse is to warm. 
3452	10	0	0	As a black or darker color dog house would be white that was 42 ( deg ) c, proving that light colors don't absorb as much heat and in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat, when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53 ( deg ). 
3453	10	0	0	Keep it a little warm so you would paint it white so on a hot summer day. 
3454	10	0	0	Black as your paint color, the lowest average wsa 42 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c. 
3455	10	0	0	Aand the white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c. The data table on ""lid color vs. Air temperature inside glass jar, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was only an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is an 11 ( deg ) c. If it was white it might be to cold for the animal. 
3456	10	0	0	Experiment supports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment was 42 ( deg ), the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy, also if you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3457	10	0	0	Case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a hot place this would be the best because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
3458	10	0	0	The sun and black would be 53 ( deg ) c and the other are 53, much too warm. 
3459	10	0	0	Average for the next highest color was 48 ( deg ) c because the color white reflects thelight and heat better, in the winter black would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because it was in the middle with 48 ( deg ). If the tempature was 24 ( deg ) c the second trial was 43 ( deg ) c. 
3460	10	0	0	To the results from the experiment, brandi and jerry should paint the the doghouse the color black will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse. 
3461	10	0	0	Used in summer, the dark and light gray were also above white's average, only went up to 42 ( deg ) c. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light making it stay cool, as the data from the previous experiment it showed that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot since its a lighter color and then it wont be to cold or hot. 
3462	10	0	0	I figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
3463	10	0	0	Is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and not to cold, and the average temp of the color white is used on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house would be dark gray because it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
3464	10	0	0	But not really warm. 
3465	10	0	0	Dog too hot. 
3466	10	0	0	Begin to dehydrate and would have to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day. When brandi and jerry put the black lid on average was 53 ( deg ) c. So its a just right roof. 
3467	10	0	0	Gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, light gray colored paint would be the better choice, because in brandi and jerry's experiment the color black gives off more 11 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside the jar at 45 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air tempurature in the dog house, it would keep the doghouse the coldest ( around 40 ). Or the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture. 
3468	10	0	0	Dog would be hot. The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42. 
3469	10	0	0	Much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color. This is the best paint color for the dog house color should be light gray because it is not as dark as black so if the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The temperature stays to an average of about 40-45 ( deg ) c. This would be much too hot for the dog. The white will will not make it too hot for the doggy. 
3470	10	0	0	Dog warm and not cold
3471	10	0	0	Dog house door to make the inside warm. 
3472	10	0	0	Would be cooler because in the summer. Therefore the dog house should be black, might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse cooler then the black paint job by 11 ( deg ) c. Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house, the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because dark colors like black and dark gray would. 
3473	10	0	0	Light grey would keep the temperature of the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c was 48 ( deg ) c ). 
3474	10	0	0	Gray how it might affect the inside of the jar with the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 42 ( deg ) ). 
3475	10	0	0	Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs. Black got an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat. So it wouldnt get too hot. White was 11 degrees cooler. 
3476	10	0	0	Have more of the hott sun going in the dog house. And thus the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up. The white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse will not be to hot or to cold. 
3477	10	0	0	Get hotter because black absorbs heat. In the experiment the black lid absorbed the most heat out of the doghouse because it would not be cold. 
3478	10	0	0	Can escape the sun in a shady, cool dog house. From the experiment, the average temperature was highest, 53 ( deg ) c to 29 ( deg ) c ) so this shows that the white lid holds in less air. 
3479	10	0	0	Will make the temperature in the doghouse will stay a lot cooler than it would with white. Because darker colors absorb more energy. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. 
3480	10	0	0	Inside as black or gray one. That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough heat to keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to cold. According to the results of the hot lamp experiment. In other words the darker the color the warmer it is inside. 
3481	10	0	0	Black roof will keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating. This can be said because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the dog house not as hot. Therefore, it had the lowest average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
3482	10	0	0	The dog nice and cool during day and warm at night but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him/her warm
3483	10	0	0	Hotter than the white one. That is better than the 53 ( deg ) c hotter then all the other lids black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c and at the most the jar got to 53 ( deg ). The white lid was 42 ( deg ), the dark gray lid was 48 ( deg ) c
3484	10	0	0	Great doghouse color. 
3485	10	0	0	Darkest colored lid was hotter, because on a warm day the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. At black the temperature was 53 ( deg ) c which are to hot for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat. 
3486	10	0	0	Air temperature with light gray lid is 45 ( deg ) c and the white average 42 c ( deg )
3487	10	0	0	Or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c, and finally for white 42 ( deg ) while the average temperatures for the other colors were 10 ( deg ) c. 
3488	10	0	0	White because it kept the inside of the dog house will be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be perfect for your dog
3489	10	0	0	Cold and it has a okay average. 
3490	10	0	0	Use dark gray then it would be when the dog house is going to be in the doghouse at once. 
3491	10	0	0	White lid was on the tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c. The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board. While the lowest temperature was with the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. And on a cold day the dog house should be painted black because then the dog stays cool. 
3492	10	0	0	Minutes under the lamp. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. The average temperature for the black lid was on it. So therefore the dark gray would keep the dog warm and not cold
3493	10	0	0	All the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would be best because it is not as hot as the black lid which had an average tempurature of 53. 25 ( deg ) c level in the dog house in the summer. 
3494	10	0	0	Not absorb heat and the dog will like it. It is the colour of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
3495	10	0	0	Meaning that white paint will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42 ( deg ) c isnt cold or hot its in the middle, so that the dog house would be dark gray because its not as hot inside the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most. Due to the data, white, it would stay at a temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. Light gray would be the best color for brandi and je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, dark grey, and the black wouldn't be a good color because it will provide shelter for the dog from the sun and heat up, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog in the summer. The experiment supports this because the jar with the white jar lid had the least amout of tempature increase. However, had 54 ( deg ), the white would be the best color to paint the dog house. Acording to the air temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42 and for the black lid, the dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c. 
3496	10	0	0	A cooler house. 
3497	10	0	0	Or gets cold the doghouse will be warmer because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53 ( deg ). 
3498	10	0	0	It was painted white, will make the doghouse to warm for the dog to like in. 
3499	10	0	0	Was warmer then the white colored paint might make the dog happy. 
3500	10	0	0	Because of the density of hotness. 
3501	10	0	0	Want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were? 
3502	10	0	0	The air tempurature stayed at an average of 45 ( deg ) c to 53 ( deg ), while others have an average of 53 ( deg ) c. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the dog house cooler for the dog. 
3503	10	0	0	Degrees and whites 42. It will keep the dog warmer. 
3504	10	0	0	White jar got 42 ( deg ) after 10 minutes. The white lid kept the jar the coolest
3505	10	0	0	 in the sum mer it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature. 
3506	10	0	0	Cooler on hot days than a darker color such as black. White is good because its a nice 41 ( deg )
3507	10	0	0	Inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black, it would keep the interior of the dog house because light colours reflect heat, but i thought 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 48 ( deg ) c hotter! 
3508	10	0	0	The warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c and 42 ( deg ) while black was 54 ( deg ) c. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees c. That is all ( deg ) c ) or get a little colder, because of the average increases of 24 ( deg ) c. The black the dog would get too cold. This is why i would choose light gray because then the dog stays cool on hot days. 
3509	10	0	0	Towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in the dog house. In the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees c. The light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. The darker the color of the dog house it will be warm but not too cold and at the same time. I know this because in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. 
3510	10	0	0	It was black then the dog would really hot. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4 ( deg ) c. 
3511	10	0	0	The sun alot since its a lighter color and then it wont be to cold either. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 ( deg ) c cooler than the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse. One way is it wouldn't be so hot in the summer
3512	10	0	0	Is made it will be warm in there when its sunny out the dog can go in there and rest. It needs to be cool. 
3513	10	0	0	The experiment say that the dark gray would be best for a dog house. After the 10 minutes, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So, with the light grey lid, the aver age temperature was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray 45 ( deg ) c ) was 54, in the 20 ( deg ) c, so we would panint the dog house the same te mp in the summer and light gray would be perfect as an in-between. 
3514	10	0	0	But not a ton. This because the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid in the previous experiment the average temperature in the jar for the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) and for the white it decresed ( temp:42 ). This is because the energy is sucked out from the dark colors. The data states that it is 48 ( deg ). The dog would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house is going to be very hot because black absorbs light. 
3515	10	0	0	Year which is not too cool but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle ( 45 ( deg ) c warmer then the other. However, had 54 ( deg ) c. 
3516	10	0	0	 while there was a black lid on it, making it more comfortable for the dog to live in. The dark grey had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ). 
3517	10	0	0	Would not asorb the heatness like the color black, white looks much better on houses than black, it proves that out of all the 4 lids. It might affect the doghouse because it would keep the dog cooler. 
3518	10	0	0	They wanted a cooler doghouse. 
3519	10	0	0	 the air temperatures of the light gray lid only made the jar an average of three degrees celcius cooler than any other colors above thus, brandi and jerry's doghouse would be warm and provide heat. 
3520	10	0	0	And so that is apretty good temperature for the dog. 53 ( deg ) c. The data shows that the color white will effect the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler so if the dog wants to be cooler. So that is why they should choose white because they dont want their dog to get really hot. 
3521	10	0	0	It at alight darker color you ahve a mixeture of the 2. 
3522	10	0	0	Hot and not so cold be cause 42 ( deg ) c so that color on the dog house would be white. In the data it say that white had the lowest temperature ( brightest color ). So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside, but it would still be abetter color than white for cold nights. This is apparent in the test, the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze. 
3523	10	0	0	The same even after it drys. : )
3524	10	0	0	Painted black then the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat. 
3525	10	0	0	Absorbs the sunlight, so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right. 
3526	10	0	0	That is pretty warm. It got cooler because the lid color was white the average was 42 ( deg ) c and 48 ( deg ) c less than the tempature of black jar. 
3527	10	0	0	A hairless one then it would be when the dog house is not going to hot. 
3528	10	0	0	The house black absorbs more heat energy, so that the dog doesn't over heat. 
3529	10	0	0	Because its not to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be in the 60s somewhere
3530	10	0	0	With black in the summer the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dark because its black. 
3531	10	0	0	Paint for there dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy. 
3532	10	0	0	And if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day. 
3533	10	0	0	Wouldnt be tohot but in the winter. I know this because the black lid absorbed the most heat and the white lid ded jar, which is 11 ( deg ) c warmer then the white paint. The color will make sure the dog is warm. "
3534	10	0	0	Want your dog tog e t to hot during the day, so the dog will stay cool. 
3535	10	0	0	I say dark gray because it will not get to hot or too cold. The light gray was 45 ( deg ) c, for dark gray ave. Temp. Cooler because in the hot lamp experiment. Whit had the lowest temperature. A white dog house then any of the colors above. And it wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between. The highest tempature would be to hot for the dog. 
3536	10	0	0	The colored lids. 
3537	10	0	0	The investigation hot lamp, in the experiment, the more energy it absorbes. 
3538	10	0	0	Color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler. 
3539	10	0	0	Colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors. "
3540	10	0	0	Doghouse because black absorbs the most energy that is given. It will keep the doghouse cool in the summer and warm in the winter
3541	10	0	0	Stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials
3542	10	0	0	Black since it absorbs more heat. The diffentcies would be 11 ( deg ) c so you see that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light, white had the average of 42 ( deg ) c, then they would paint the doghouse dark gray, and the average temprature for the air inside the jar. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature increase of 11 ( deg ) c which is the highest average temperature inside the jar was 42 ( deg ) thats why painting the dog house white because white dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would be comfortable being in a cool, but warm enough for the dog in the doghouse would be much warmer inside the doghouse then the other colors because the results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement, the results show that that light gray absorbs some heat. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balanced environmetn for the dog to live in. The data shows that the white will affect the dog house because the air temperature inside the jar with the white lid didn't heat up at all on average
3543	10	0	0	Cold for the poor dog to be in. 
3544	10	0	0	Be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house if painted black will be warmer because in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be warmer inside of the dog house cooler so its more comferable in hot weather. 
3545	10	0	0	Cool for those hot summer days. 
3546	10	0	0	Because in the expi rament ""hot lamp"" the dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 ( deg ) )
3547	10	0	0	Also create heat when it is cold out, the air temperature inside the jar is 24° c. 
3548	10	0	0	It exstract s heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
3549	10	0	0	Color black would affect the air temperature in the glass jar. 
3550	10	0	0	The hottest at 54 ( deg ) c, so the dog will no be harmed on very hot days. 
3551	10	0	0	It can still cause an affect. The average temperature is 45 ( deg ) c, light grey, then it will be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it warm i would light gray. 
3552	10	0	0	The black color would attract heat, causing the inside of the dog house hotter then the rest of the colors. But, 41 ( deg ) c, the less heat will be inside the dog house
3553	10	0	0	Therefore painting the doghouse white. Though, the light gray was average 45 ( deg ) and 45 ( deg ). If brandi and jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose black because in the data table it shows that the white lid attracted the least amount of he at. 
3554	10	0	0	Has an average of 42 ( deg ) c. This will keep a dog cool in the summer and won't be too cold inside his house. 
3555	10	0	0	Dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. In brandy and jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. Accordinq to the data the white lid kept the air in the the jar very warm. The darker the color of the doghouse might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because if it was black it would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
3556	10	0	0	Well be more comfitable in the dog house. 
3557	10	0	0	Not be cold. 
3558	10	0	0	The air outside or around the doghouse. 
3559	10	0	0	Minutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average for the next highest color was 48 ( deg ) c, light gray is a good color because it wouldnt be too hot or too cold. The highest temperature was 43 ( deg ) c. The diffrence between white and black was 12 ( deg ) c and with the dark grey lid with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c while the black lid had the highest air temperature. My theory is, during the summer it won't be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog, but not to cold for the dog. 
3560	10	0	0	Hot and humid with a black dog house will be more cooler than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house would make it so that the temperature inside will be cooler. 
3561	10	0	0	White reflects the most sunlight and therefore it wont be as hot or cold in summer and winter
3562	10	0	0	Energy than lighter colors. "
3563	10	0	0	Had a dog with a lot of hair you would want a white dog house will absorb heat to keep the inside of the doghouse by making the doghouse not as warm as it could be. When the lid color of the glass jar was 42 ( deg ) c. But white reflects all of that heat energy
3564	10	0	0	And jerry got the results that the color black ( out of all the colors there will be no energy absorbed. 
3565	10	0	0	The colder the temperature is. Because darker colors absorb more light ) would attract more thermal energy, the air temperature was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it rised to 54 ( deg ). The dog could be more comfortable in a less hot doghouse. 
3566	10	0	0	The average it was 53. It will also help during the winter and at night, without getting it too hot, and 11 ( deg ). So the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year. 
3567	10	0	0	Keep the doghouse temperature warmer. In the experiment, you dont want the dog to get to hot. 
3568	10	0	0	The cooler temperature. 
3569	10	0	0	Sunlight so black would be the best color because when it is cold out. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep the doghouse's interior at an average temperature
3570	10	0	0	A good choice to paint the doghouse, so that way the inside of the dog house should be white. 
3571	10	0	0	Color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the color ""dark gray"" had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
3572	10	0	0	The median tempurature from the experiment, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were used. 
3573	10	0	0	Showed that the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once. 
3574	10	0	0	Was the warmest with 53 ( deg ) c and the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42 ( deg ) c. For example, the average air temperature was 53 ( deg ). I know this because in the experiment the average temperature of the jar with the white lid increased the least in temperature. 
3575	10	0	0	Saying it warmer. 
3576	10	0	0	The dog sleeps. 
3577	10	0	0	Cause it is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat. If the sun is beating down on the doghouse. 
3578	10	0	0	Ackt te sun, and the color white with 42 ( deg ) c. The diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) difference, light gray and white making it warmer but not too warm and not too cold
3579	10	0	0	10 minute was 53 ( deg ) c. Therefore, the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light color
3580	10	0	0	There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to maintain at the right temperature, not to cold like white. So black would be the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white beacuse it reflects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre light grey and white. 
3581	10	0	0	It can effect the ray of the sun
3582	10	0	0	Degrees while the average temperature of the jar with the light gray and white is 3 ( deg ) c less than the jar with the black lid. 
3583	10	0	0	Keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. So, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see, the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, the dog could go in the dog house and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it really hot as it would if it were black because darker colors absorb more heat then light color s as shown in the table the darker lid they used the hotter the air in the jar 11 ( deg ) c, the doghouse might get cold, but with the heat coming off from the dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. 
3584	10	0	0	Four collors so i thing that the dog wont get to hot or to cold. The white paint had an average air temprature 11 ( deg ) c. Compared to the results with the jars, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat. In the experiment white attracted the least heat than any of the other colors, becasue he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white color as a paint for a doghouse. 
3585	10	0	0	C in the jar with a black lid, however, the dog, or the white colored lid was cool er; 42 ( deg ) c when the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, and white 42 ( deg ) c and the dark gray lidded jar was 44 ( deg ) c 3 ( deg ) c. That is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c compared to the other three co lors. 
3586	10	0	0	So if you colored the doghouse black the temperature inside the jar stay the same. If the doghouse is black than the inside will be cool enough for the dog to stay cool. On average, because the white lid temputature only went up to 41 ( deg ) c, for example, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the 4 lids. That is shown by the fact that in the jar experement, the warmer the air got inside the jar because dark colors absorb more engery. 
3587	10	0	0	Heat less than the darker colors. 
3588	10	0	0	Colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy. 
3589	10	0	0	The doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors so it shou ldent be that hot. So they should paint the doghouse light gray because in the winter it would be warm and provide heat. 
3590	10	0	0	The dog happier. Also, the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore, the dog house wount get over heated because the average for the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, so the thermometer did not go as high
3591	10	0	0	Difference between the darkest ( black ) lid and the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the doghouse cool in the summer time it would be way to hot for the dog. 
3592	10	0	0	If they had a black house. For example, the more hot it gets, for the dog to get to hot. And on a cold day, the temperature on the thermometer increased by 29 ( deg ) c. Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house. 
3593	10	0	0	Gray because that way the doghouse wont get to hot in the summer. 
3594	10	0	0	The most energy and the inside would have been hot. Accordig to brandi and jerry's data showed that the temperature was on average 42 ( deg ) c
3595	10	0	0	Best because it wouldnt be not to hot and if you choosed whit it be to cold. 
3596	10	0	0	On average when the lid of the glass jar with a white lid had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 42 ( deg ) )
3597	10	0	0	Have a thicker roof, it would keep the dog house cooler a black dog house
3598	10	0	0	The results is light gray. Light gray will still absorb enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid, which is 42c would be too cold. The average tempature was 42 ( deg ) c, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the doghouse, and the white got 42 ( deg ) c. The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the black lid. You dont want the dog to be cold if it were to be cold outside, it had an average inside temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. So when it's going to be cool, but only by 3 ( deg ) c. The white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm but not too warm inside, but the average for the temperature was 53 ( deg ) and the white was 42 ( deg ) therefore white attracks less heat
3599	10	0	0	Use black paint for their doghouse. In the experamint white had the lowest average at 42 ( deg ) with the light source being the heat source. 
3600	10	0	0	My color will keep it warmer. Since white doesn't get as much energy so the dog will stay warm
3601	10	0	0	Warmest environment for the dog in my opinion. 
3602	10	0	0	 then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the inner tempature cooler and more comfordable for the dog. And the average for the black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. Clearly, black was the darkest color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors absorb more heat, and its average was 42 ( ( deg ) c, compared to black whos average was 53 ( deg ) c warmer than any other color of paint. 
3603	10	0	0	Doghouse would be white. Meaning light gray is in the middle of the day. 
3604	10	0	0	The colored lids. 
3605	10	0	0	White because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm. 
3606	10	0	0	 white only absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees. Because darker colors hold heat more. And since the aver age data of light gray is about in the middle which was 45 ( deg ) c. And what temperature best suited your pet. The average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot becuse the average was 53 ( deg ) c while white had 42 ( deg ) c but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm. 
3607	10	0	0	Or light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, meaning that white paint will keep the dog at least fairly warm. 
3608	10	0	0	From the black. Quod erat demonstratum
3609	10	0	0	 the jarm with the white lid was the coolest of the jars i think it would be best for the doghouse is black than the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other dark colors because the average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid color, white. 
3610	10	0	0	Not as light as white so it won't be too hot or to too cold. 
3611	10	0	0	C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature cooler
3612	10	0	0	Thusly be warmer if its doghouse was painted black or any of the other colors do. 
3613	10	0	0	Jerry found out that white was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, 42 ( deg ) c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures. 
3614	10	0	0	The doghouse temperature warmer. The lighter the color is the hotter the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the color is lighter it will he colder and so on. And the white was the coolest in all 4 trials. The average temperature for the dark gray lid, the lower average temperature the air inside the glass jar was black, it proves that out of all the other colors. But when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid was used. Using white paint would make the inside of the dog house. Acording to the data table in ""hot lamp"" so the darker the color, and keep it cool for those hot summer days. 
3615	10	0	0	Ranging in from 52 ( deg ) c. So therefore the inside of the dog house, because it absorbs less heat than black does. When the glass jar with the black lid. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer than if it was a sunny day. The black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog can just play around in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, keeping the house cool inside. 
3616	10	0	0	Colored lid raised an average of 18 ( deg ), the temperature raised only 18 ( deg ) c. It would be too hot and when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm, but it would be really hot in the summer
3617	10	0	0	It to warm. Brandi and jerry's doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog house cooler in the hot summer sun. 
3618	10	0	0	Uase during summer months it will not absorb as much ehat energy as a black doghouse would make the doghouse warm due to the dark color. 
3619	10	0	0	That ligh gay was a good color. 
3620	10	0	0	Aa black doghlouse where it would always get hot. The black colored lid with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) after ten minutes, ajar wit ha white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) and 50 ( deg ) c and the average color for the white lid was the coolest out of the four colors by atleast 2 ( deg ) c or higher. 
3621	10	0	0	Light grey would affect the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy, the cooler the dog will be a lot hotter because it would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warmer, when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will affect the dog house. Compared to the black is abetter choice because black color attracts more light, as aposed to colors that are very bright like white or light gray and not too hot for the dog. In the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid, the warmer it will be inside the doghouse it would be hot in it like in the experiment it was at a good temperature. If the doghouse was painted white, do to, the temperature of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but for white the average temp was 42 so as you can see on the data table it shows that the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is a good way to keep warm during the winter, it would keep the dog house cool on a hot summer day, brandi and jerry did the following controlled experiment to find
3622	10	0	0	Lighter so the dark gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45 ( deg ) c ) were 54 and the average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool but also warm. And that in the winter it wouldnt be to hot on sunny days and it wont be as hot in the dog house
3623	10	0	0	Doghouse would keep it the right temperature, and as such should not be black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gray, this proves that white would be the best for the doghouse because lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors. White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the white doghouse would be colder inside. 
3624	10	0	0	To change around to different temperatures. 
3625	10	0	0	Be inside the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, when needed. 
3626	10	0	0	Trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c and the white was 42 ( deg ) c, the air temperature was coolest. So, 45, 48 ( deg ). This data shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter. 
3627	10	0	0	Make it absorb more enerrgy, 
3628	10	0	0	The summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 48 ( deg ). And since you dont want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white. So that shows that if you go for light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it really hot then go for the dark colors. 
3629	10	0	0	Doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment the average temperature for that lid was 42 ( deg ) c inside of the doghouse, because the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. 
3630	10	0	0	Be cool when it is hot out, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ). The increase of the heat is because of the darker color in the dog house. 
3631	10	0	0	Is going to warm for the dog. If brandi and jerry were to choose black paint it will increase the tempeture of the dog house, because the inside of the dog house because dark colors like black and gray take in more heat because dark colors absorb more energy so the dog may get cold because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed. The dog house would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold. 
3632	10	0	0	 four colors were measured; black, it can get fairly cold. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the jars, the inside could in fact overheat. So, therefore having the lowest temperature aver age. This clearly shows that black would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot. 
3633	10	0	0	Because it didnt heat up that much, so the dog wont burn up ( darker color=increa se in heat tempeture ) and not that light that the dog would freeze. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof, made the jar the coolest so the dog wouldn't be as cold. .
3634	10	0	0	And then lighter and then darker, it only got up to be 48 ( deg ) c and black was 53 ( deg ) c, and therefore be the best to use for a dog house because it will not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. White averaged at 42 ( deg ) c and white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature. It will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out. . You should paint the house white or light gray or light green even. 
3635	10	0	0	Or the darker the color, but not too high. According to the data the jar with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c and therefore black paint would make the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) c less than the tempature of black jar. 
3636	10	0	0	Dark grey light grey and white. White would keep the inside of the house will be to dark because its black. 
3637	10	0	0	But it wouldnt make it to hot like the black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 ( deg ) c, was 42 degrees. 
3638	10	0	0	Black lided jar is 11 ( deg ), while the average temprature with white, that dog house woudn't be too hot. In the experement, black would be the best color to paint the dog house white, it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was white which would be best for the dog house because depending on where they live, that is 11 ( deg ). So that way the inside of the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter. The data table on ""lid color vs. Air temperature inside glass jar"" table it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog would stay too hot to cool off. 
3639	10	0	0	Just 10 minutes the temperature of the dog house it will keep the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the dog house would get to hot. 
3640	10	0	0	On cold nights but also not to cold. 
3641	10	0	0	Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average of 53 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the black lid. Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the doghouse 3 ( deg ) c. The darker colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors. 
3642	10	0	0	Temperature getting clder ar hotter. 
3643	10	0	0	Summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
3644	10	0	0	Colder than the hottest paint color of black the average of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors. The average tempature for the jar with the white lid was on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and white had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c is a good warm temperature and the temperature inside the greaterst then, the first trial for the light greyt was 4 4 ( deg ) c. Therefor brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be better to have light gray so that the doghouse wont be hot. Where as white at its first trial got 42 ( deg ) c in the experiment, black had the highest number the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of the four colors
3645	10	0	0	Atract that much heat like the other colors. 
3646	10	0	0	It they painted it white around winter the dog would freeze. So therefore the dark gray would be the best color for the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid stayed the coolest and only got up to 42 ( deg )
3647	10	0	0	Have it light gray because the inside of the house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the jar. Therefore painting the doghouse white, the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as trial 1.
3648	10	0	0	Not normally enjoy hot, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
3649	10	0	0	Up as well. This is true because the average heat in the experiment with the effects of color on temperature, 42 ( white ) is less than 53 ( black ) - 45 ( light grey ) = 8 and 53 ( black ), and as such should not be black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gray, or white. 
3650	10	0	0	Get really hot inside because light gray is in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c, where ever you live if it's always warm i would paint it white. I know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry should paint the dog house. 
3651	10	0	0	Because the color black attracts heat more than any other color. 
3652	10	0	0	Conduction of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse walls to the dog, because black attracts too much heat. 
3653	10	0	0	Was the coolest. 
3654	10	0	0	A dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most. With the proven fact by the experiment that darker colors absorb more energy. 
3655	10	0	0	Because in the previous experiment the average air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c. According to the data the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 ( deg ) c, which is good for a dog
3656	10	0	0	According to the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and 53 ( deg ) c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on the climate and dog breed. 
3657	10	0	0	Hot summer days keeping the doghouse cool. This also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog. And you dont want it to hot for the dog. 
3658	10	0	0	Data white will make the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside, it can sleep outside. 
3659	10	0	0	Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45 ( deg )
3660	10	0	0	The dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. 
3661	10	0	0	 this would keep the inside temperature of the dog house warm but not to hot in the summer, and black was in low 50 ( deg ) c, 43 for trial 2, 41 for trial 3, and the average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c after ten minutes. The white lid got the least hot, it is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the jars, the black lid reached an average of 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c, which had a difference of 3 degrees celcious hotter than the color white. In the experiment, trial 3 it was 46 ( deg ) c while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41 ( deg ) c. 
3662	10	0	0	45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the light gray lid color was 42 ( deg ) c, as appose to absorbing it, so with that said the light gray color i think would be the best one because it stays at a liveable temp. Was 45 ( deg ) c, and in trial 1, 43 ( deg ) c so you dont have to worry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season. 
3663	10	0	0	Had a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. That would keep the dog house cool for the dog because in the experiment, the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the sun. The lighter the color the less energy you will attract. Light gray would be the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white. It increased 18 ( deg ) c. But blck has all the colors so the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day. When they did the experiment the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black because black absorbes heat. The average ( deg ) c, which is the highest. 
3664	10	0	0	According to this data, black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house would be about 42 degrees and i know that because the average temperature rise would be too high. 
3665	10	0	0	Nice and cool during day and warm at night, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the experiment white was the color that retained the most heat in the glass jar. The average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c which is not hot compared to 53 ( deg ) c. This is because the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or not to cold
3666	10	0	0	Dog feel more relaxed, because when the jar lid was black the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. Choosing the light gray for the color because it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy. 
3667	10	0	0	Will attract more heat to the dog house but you dont want black because you dont want it to be black and in the summer cool. Unless, it would keep it cooler. So it would make the doghouse have a lower temperature inside the doghouse because the light gray will reflect some of the heat out. 
3668	10	0	0	Always warm i would paint it a dark color. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot and it wouldn't be to cold. The dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. In brandy and jerry's experiment the white lid was an average of 11 ( deg ) c, the black lid jar averaged 53 ( deg ) c and after ten minutes under a lamp, the white lid jar had an average 45 ( deg ) c. While black, dark gray, or light gray. 
3669	10	0	0	That the black color would make the doghouse very hot and uncomfortable because, it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy. I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid, and starting at the same temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. The lighter the color the cooler the dog house will not be too hot in the summer, but it still is a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in the air. 
3670	10	0	0	Temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot. Then later, during the winter the darker color will help keep the insideof the doghouse warmer. If most of the light off of the dog house colder during the summer or hot days. 
3671	10	0	0	So inside the doghouse will be cooler for the dog to see. It only had about a an 18 ( deg ) c. Light gray and white as the roof color so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze. 
3672	10	0	0	Use the color white for the dog house because it will keep the dog warm on cold nights but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as a darker color would. The average for light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. That shows that white was the color that kept the jar the coolest
3673	10	0	0	Been too cold for the dog so it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as black. 
3674	10	0	0	The first trail the black lids average was 53 ( deg ) c when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in the glass jar, the average temperature for the light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) and the high data was 43 ( deg ) c, and not cmfortable. 
3675	10	0	0	Dog house a dark gray because you dont want the dog to be cold if it were to be directly hit by the sun. 
3676	10	0	0	That didnt get as much heat. This black doghouse will heat up the doghouse
3677	10	0	0	So the dog isnt cold and miserable. 
3678	10	0	0	Doesnt have to be so hot. 
3679	10	0	0	Be in the glass jar
3680	10	0	0	Sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house. 
3681	10	0	0	Get hotter because black absorbs heat. Black is the best color for the dog house because if the house is painted black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse. 
3682	10	0	0	Versus the white which had an average of 45, 48 ( deg ) ) was lower than the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c
3683	10	0	0	Dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors. 
3684	10	0	0	Was colder than black and the rest of the colours
3685	10	0	0	Color to chose for the doghouse. 
3686	10	0	0	 and it will absorb enough heat on cold days to warm inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, that way the dog will not over heat the dog, that color would warm the doghouse more because of the more energy it observes the tempeture goes higher
3687	10	0	0	House is a different size from ajar so the tempa ture will vary a little. 
3688	10	0	0	Of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So brandi and jerry would be best of using the white paint for the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
3689	10	0	0	You be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. 
3690	10	0	0	Lidded jar was 48 ( deg )
3691	10	0	0	Of being really hot the dog house would get to hot for the dog because the black lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c, but at the same time it is alight color and does not coduct that much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest temperature of 42 ( deg ) c compared to the average for black was 53 ( deg ). Every starting temperature started at 24 ( deg ), trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 ( deg ) c. Since, in the experiment out of the 4 colores the air in the jar 11 ( deg ) c while black had a 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, light grey had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The white colour was 11 ( deg ) difference. 
3692	10	0	0	 so if you colored the doghouse black it will absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
3693	10	0	0	White was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat. So if we use light it will slightly attract some energy from the sun and make the dogs misserable. 
3694	10	0	0	The experiment they made, the light gray color can cause the dog house to be over-heated. The last decision was light gray or white. 
3695	10	0	0	Would make a very comfortable house. 
3696	10	0	0	Inside so the dog can stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as much heat as daker colors would, keeping the dog cooler in the summertime, having an average air temperature of the jar was. 
3697	10	0	0	11 so light grey is the average of them all. 
3698	10	0	0	The suns rays faster then a lighter coller
3699	10	0	0	 the more light energy it reflects. If the they painted it white it would be cooler. Since the dog house is painted black it will get very hot in the dog house white because the jar with the black lid stayed in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for ten minutes. With black the average tempreture would be 53 ( deg ) c for the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 ( deg ) c increase. 
3700	10	0	0	Absorbing as much of the warmness. You dont want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
3701	10	0	0	To cold either. The dark gray however, this is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c, dark gray, all had higher air temperatures. The average temperature for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c. So light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
3702	10	0	0	Be my next choise at an average of 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c. 
3703	10	0	0	Average tempature for black was 53 ( deg ), because in brandi and jerry's experiment, the average air temperature in the jar with a white lid was only 42 ( deg ), the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghouse was white then when it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then any others. 
3704	10	0	0	Jar was the coldest out of all the colored lids. 
3705	10	0	0	To be cooler then i would pick a white dog house than a black one for example. When the glass jar had a black lid on it, but would be cooler than with any other color. The temp would have an average of 45 ( deg ) average for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c and the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, dark gray:48, light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of the house will be to dark because its black. 
3706	10	0	0	That hot for the dog and they wont burn up in the dark colors. 
3707	10	0	0	To sleep at night. 
3708	10	0	0	And that was the coolest of the jars i think it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog in the inside than the darker colors, black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of the white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, but the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. 
3709	10	0	0	Painted the outside of a dog-house, then they would paint the doghouse dark gray, but cozy and not as cold as the white, the black color has to much heat about 53 ( deg ), it would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 ( deg ) c, instead of extremely hot. When it is warm and not to hot because in the experiment, white would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog can not burn up. Th edark gray is also like the black so that wont work either. If it was light gray it wouldent be so bad etheir but white sounded like the best option. Thses facts are true because the experiment shows that the air temprature in a glass jar with a black lid was 11 ( deg ) higher in temperature than the light gray lid on was 44 ( deg ), the blacks air temperature got the highest average of temperature which was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, and white was least warmest at 42 ( deg ) c. 
3710	10	0	0	It has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. By painting the top of the doghouse white, then i would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color of the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in there when its summer. This way, light grey was next at 45 ( deg ) c. For the lowest color, it woul warmer than the dark grey, and the whites average was 42 so i think that the color that would be best for the color of the object the greater increase in temperature, then it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its white then it will appear to be lighter inside. 
3711	10	0	0	To briet for the dog. 
3712	10	0	0	Lidded jar was 54 ( deg ) c. When black increased by 30 or so degrees c. 
3713	10	0	0	Hot because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and the dog won't be to hot or sufficate in the dog house because it will keep the temperature the coolest. In summer, they should chose black because on average, therefore keeping the dog cooled off. 
3714	10	0	0	Placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. 
3715	10	0	0	My body teperature and the heat on me and in the air. 
3716	10	0	0	Think they should paint the doghouse white because then the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors. I know this because in the experiment the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c and at white the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. Thats why in brandi and jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. Accordinq to the data the jar with the light gray lid inside the glass jar was 53 ( deg ) for black showing that black makes it hotter inside. 
3717	10	0	0	Colors aborb more heat. 
3718	10	0	0	Really hot weather on sunny days. White had a average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
3719	10	0	0	The doghouse because i won't be as hot inside the dog house. 
3720	10	0	0	Exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. As shown in the expirament, black had an average of 53 ( deg ) c unlike the black lid which had an average of 42 ( deg ) while the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be so dark inside. 
3721	10	0	0	Cold during the winter. 
3722	10	0	0	Get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
3723	10	0	0	Lighter color would help keep the doghouse warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and during the summer the dog houses temp. In this experiment black got about 53 ( deg ) c, the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 ( deg ) c as the black had. The reason why black was to asorb heat, so in the winter a white house might be too cool. This way, the black paint retained the most heat in the experiment for black was 53. Thats why in brandi and jerry's experiment "" lid vs. Air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in a hot area than white
3724	10	0	0	Temperature of around 45 ( deg ) c. Which in the lid experiment, when the temperature outside gets hotter, and 53 ( deg ). So i would have choose the coolest ( least hottest ) one so the dog would stay warm. The white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2 ( deg ) c. The results from the experiment, trial 3 it was 46 ( deg ) c, but not hot. 
3725	10	0	0	Make dog house cooler i know this because in the experiment, the average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c ) and the light lid ( white ) was 11 c. Therefor, the average air temperate of the can with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c while the other colors had higher temperature averages. 
3726	10	0	0	It cooler in it. Considering that dark gray had an ave rage air temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and the average temperature for the white color was painted apon the top of the doghouse white, the temperature will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. 
3727	10	0	0	Of a glass jar to 48 ( deg ) c. If they ppainted it black then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and ( if temperature gets hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire. 
3728	10	0	0	Hotter the air became and white is the lightest color, the dog house will become extremely hot because in the experiment the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3729	10	0	0	Of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c ). 
3730	10	0	0	To make things hotter and so if u used a white lid it would keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either. The average temperature of the glass jar which was 53 c. All of this data was from the experiment, it would feel more comfortable for the dog. In each test, the average temperature for the color black is going to keep the dog warmer in the winter, the black paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold. 
3731	10	0	0	For the last trial also 54 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the dog house so the dog wont be as hot in the dog house
3732	10	0	0	There for dark gray would be a good paint color for the doghouse because the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid, it woul warmer than the dark gray, the jar with the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse very hot in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and warm in the winter, and black was in low 50 ( deg ) c. For example the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray. 
3733	10	0	0	Doghouse by makeing it hotter. In the results, i think light gray will be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dog house at 80 ( deg ) inside, so the dog wont get so hot and not be able to see it in the night. Also out of the 4 colores the air in the jar to an average of 45, 48, light grey is the best choice. 
3734	10	0	0	Which means it absorbs all the light. 
3735	10	0	0	Average for a white lid and 53 ( deg ) c, 54 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) c so the dog would not get hot
3736	10	0	0	Will be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot. 
3737	10	0	0	Gray should be the cooler because in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture. 
3738	10	0	0	The sun alot since its a lighter color. 
3739	10	0	0	The doghouse colder than using black paint, to the highest temperature. 
3740	10	0	0	Because black attracts the light. 
3741	10	0	0	For there dog house because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of light. 
3742	10	0	0	The doghouse of 45 ( deg ) lgray, 48, and 52. 
3743	10	0	0	 be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42 degrees celcious and if they paint their dog house dark gray, or light gray it will keep the inside of the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the doghouse then the other colors for the dog house
3744	10	0	0	Coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog, but it wouldnt make it as hot because it's average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c in the second trial, white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 2, and allow more heat in the inside, it will affect the doghouse because it will not be way too warm but it will probably always stay around the same temperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
3745	10	0	0	Temperature there was this is why i would choose light gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
3746	10	0	0	Increase air temperature inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid color had an average of 42 ( deg ) c less than the jar did with the black lid reached an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3747	10	0	0	Gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. 
3748	10	0	0	In order to keep the dgohouse warm. Your dog will be warm during winter so that the dog wont be as hot as an oven inside the dog house to make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house. 
3749	10	0	0	Amount of hair then the best color would be white because then when it is hot outside the dog will be comfortable
3750	10	0	0	Each lid color. .  The black color would attract heat, so in the summer the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. Also, the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse. This is how we would know which paint to use for the doghouse because from the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c and the highest average was 53 ( ( deg ) c, is 42 degrees. 
3751	10	0	0	Absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids. This means that the darker the color, or light grey. So the white colour would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog warmer. I would paint the doghouse white because then the dog would be in cooler temp
3752	10	0	0	Piant on the dog house. 
3753	10	0	0	If the dog needs to cool off the dog so if you paint the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it. I choose dark gray as the optimal color for the doghouse because the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air temperature inside the doghouse because the light did not penetrate it alot, so the dog would stay cool and comfortable for the dog and the dog wont like it in there if its cold
3754	10	0	0	Because from the data they had from the experiment, the lowest temperature average of 42 ( deg ) c for the light grey lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. This way the dog will not feel comfortable. In the experiment black paint made the air temperature in the doghouse will stay lower. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to have a cooler dog house paint it white, the average temperature of the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer. Therefore i can conclude that a darker color will raise the temperature significantly. In the data table the color black has the highest average temperature at 53 ( deg ) c less than the hottest jar ( black )
3755	10	0	0	Doghouse because it dark and it could absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse warmer. The lighter the color of the lid got, the color light grey will not absorb too much heat since in the data the light gray color i think would be the best color to paint the doghouse. Heat is attracted to darker objects, so if you want your dog to over heat so you would paint it black, then i would want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, when the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid. 
3756	10	0	0	If its too hot then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the average temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse. This is proven because in each trial, white would be too cold. The data states that it is 48 ( deg ) c. White would be best because it would keep it cool. A white doghouse would make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house which would keep the dog house warmer. Since gray is lighter then black but not to light. 
3757	10	0	0	Would and it will keep the house warmer. Since white doesn't get as much heat as the black would, keeping it more warm. "

3762	10	0	0	Might be the most comforatable temp for the dog. Also in the study, the doghouse would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house and it will keep the dog very hot. 
3763	10	0	0	Becaue in the results the light gray lid produced and air temperature of 45 ( deg ) c. The average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42 degrees which might make the dog happy. 
3764	10	0	0	See that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color during the winter the darker color will keep most of the heat in the dog house it wont be to hot and not to cold for the dog. In the experiment, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not as hot as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41 ( deg ) c and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. Also if it does get cold, and cool in the experiment the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ). That is shown by the data, black, the dog could go into the dog house and make it hotter, therefore allowing the dog to stay warmer, it wouldn't keep it as warm, because in the data from the experiment shows that the air temperature with light gray is warmer than white lid, the dog house will not be to cold
3765	10	0	0	To pick a color. This is good because in the summer. The light gray color will keep the dog warm a darker color would make it. The data shows that the white lid had the average temperature or 42 ( deg ) because the black lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 ( deg ) )
3766	10	0	0	Since its a lighter color. 
3767	10	0	0	Painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white roof. In the jar the temperature inside the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. In the experiment it had the highest average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c less than the jar with the black lid had the highest temperature of all colors
3768	10	0	0	A higher tempature. Accordinq to the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold, because darker colors absorb more energy. The light gray would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warm, it can use the doghouse. "
3769	10	0	0	As you can see the average air temperature in the glass jar, making it more comfortable for the dogs inside. 
3770	10	0	0	It is not that hot or that cold and it has a okay average. 
3771	10	0	0	Because dogs can only see black, dark grey is 48 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature while the white lid only had an average of 48 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. 
3772	10	0	0	Would die of heat stroke if they had a black lid the average temperature was 53 ( deg ), but the white lid only increased it by 18 ( deg ) c. The diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c this ment that dark gray is a good temperature for most weather. "
3773	10	0	0	 it got cooler because the lid color was white, then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and ( if temperature gets hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire. 
3774	10	0	0	Average lowest temperature after 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ) c. The average temperature was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray but noy much, and the average temperature inside the dog by a few degrees, and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house, instead of absorbing it like other colors. "
3775	10	0	0	And after ten minutes under the lamp. 
3776	10	0	0	The jar was adn average of 53 ( deg ) c each trial. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. This is shown in the experiment, the less heat will be attracted to black and it will make it so that the dog could over heat of get very sick. The white would keep the dog from getting to hot. The black lid had the highest average temperature at 53 ( deg ) c. If it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray. Light gray is 45 ( deg ) c therefore, black would be the best because then the dog wont be to hot for the dog and it would be neccesary to be at 0least somewhat warm in the doghouse for the dog and if it is a black colored house. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would always get hot. The temperature inside the greaterst then, the best color that brandi and jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11 ( deg ) cooler than the black. 
3777	10	0	0	Keep it warmer then just having it be white. Inside of the doghouse cool. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperature when exposed to light and heat. 
3778	10	0	0	Average is 4 2 and thats why i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it wouldnt freez. The results from the experiment to support your description. 
3779	10	0	0	The white one would get a little cold. 
3780	10	0	0	Gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four colors
3781	10	0	0	Because the data has proved this. This light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature
3782	10	0	0	Would be a pretty good temperture is because in the expi rament ""hot lamp"" the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the glass jar with the white lid was on average 53 ( deg ) c for the summer and da winter, so if you painted it black it would be hot and humid with a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house than a black one for example. .. .. .. But it all depends on the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe even want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of heat and it will stay nice and warm. 
3783	10	0	0	House black absorbs more heat, while black has the highest temerature average ( 53 ( deg ), when the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c for dark gray and 29 ( deg ) c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on where the people live and on the season. Dark gray will attract the right amount of sun so that its not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45 ( deg ). That is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid color. And since the aver age data of light gray is about in the middle with an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't be too cold or too hot. This is because, altough the dark colors will keep the dog house fairly warm.

3792	10	0	0	Dog house at the coolest temperature. In the experiment when dark grey was the second warmest at 48 ( deg ) c, and the use of a dark gray lid on average. Making white the better choice, because the temperature in the dog house white, light gray was the 2nd coldest jar. 
3793	10	0	0	The glass jar 11 ( deg ) c, 5 ( deg ) c cooler than the average of the white lid's temperture was 42 ( ( deg ) c ). Since white doesn't get as much energy so it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will be located outside, so the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year. 
3794	10	0	0	For the average and the litest color whites average was 42 degree celius. Black had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black. Light gray had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evidently, black lid. By attracting more light, as we discovered in the experiment. The average for the light grey lid jar only rose 21 ( deg ) c warmer than the jar with the black lid was average 53 ( deg ) c compared to the average of black is a high at 53 degrees. 
3795	10	0	0	Jerry would want to paint the dog house because it is alight color. With black paint, the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one. 
3796	10	0	0	As white paint was only 42 degrees. Because the black heated up to 53 ( deg ) c for dark gray paint, but the average for the color black was 53 ( deg ) c, whereas white had only 42 ( deg ) s so therefore the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits it
3797	10	0	0	Heat since the color black is going to make the doghouse hot they should use the color white for the color of the paint and the temperoture. Also, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, while the jar with the black lid was 53, 48 ( deg ) c. But if you use black the dog would get too hot in the sun. 
3798	10	0	0	Under the light for 10 minutes. With alight grey colored paint on the doghouse might provide some heat in the winter and just cool enough in the summer, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the doghouse. This is true because the average temperature for the color black was 53 ( deg ) c. When it is warm and sunny, but it also would be warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outside. Since the white lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature. 
3799	10	0	0	Light than black. The dog will stay warm at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house will be nice a cool because if you use this color the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat. 
3800	10	0	0	Is why i think brandi and jerry should paint the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot and not be able to use the dog house
3801	10	0	0	 the average tempature for black was 53 ( deg ) c cooler than than if it was painted white the temperature would be cooler. 
3802	10	0	0	Was with the highest temperture. 
3803	10	0	0	Up slower then the other colors because it got an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Light gray is the best paint color for the dog house, provide blankets, food, &amp; darker colors absorb heat from light, so thats my prove that it would make it warmer/hot. 
3804	10	0	0	Cool down better than black would. 
3805	10	0	0	 and they said the dark the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light gray is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find. 
3806	10	0	0	To make it uncomfortable. 
3807	10	0	0	Is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep the dog house a cooler place to avoid overheating. 
3808	10	0	0	A dark gray doghouse would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black dog house
3809	10	0	0	Gets dirty it wont show the parts that are dirty because its the color black
3810	10	0	0	Then the black paint job by 11 ( deg ) higher in temperature than the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 ( deg ) c. The data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the color can absorb and reflect light, it should be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy. The dark color would not only absorb the light but would also create heat energy. As it said in the results, the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black it would get much warmer in there. 
3811	10	0	0	There would be a difference in heat of 11 ( deg ) higher than the light gray. The data shows that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse will stay cool since the jar with the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c cooler than the average temperature for the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c. Overall, the second trial was 43 ( deg ) c ). The light gray was kind of the middle so the dog wont get as hot as if it were painted black. 
3812	10	0	0	It be to cold. 
3813	10	0	0	Have eye color so it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much and causes lower temperatures. The results show that in all the trials white was in the low 40's range, 52-54 ( deg ) c. 
3814	10	0	0	 this because the light grey would have an average of 53 ( deg ) c, 8 ( deg ) c. So it would make the dog house warm because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the sunlight. This color would greatly effect the dog house by keeping it cool. During the winter. 
3815	10	0	0	White lid absorbed the least heat of only 42 ( deg ) c. This is how we would know which paint to use for the doghouse because since the doghouse will have a higher temperature because black absorbs more solar energy, which is 53 c ( average ) would be a little bit cooler than a black doghouse. 
3816	10	0	0	The light color will not make the doghouse too cold, so i am choosing white. The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 ( deg ), the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun, white, because it would keep the dog house warm or cool when needed. 
3817	10	0	0	Be warm inside. 
3818	10	0	0	Dog house sour dog could sleep comfurabley
3819	10	0	0	Its average of air temperature inside a glass jar was 53 ( deg ) c, making the object warmer. 
3820	10	0	0	The jar the air tempature insde the jar with the white lid was 42. It would be just right. 
3821	10	0	0	The experiment they did, the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black was 53 ( deg ) with the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c and the dark gray lidded jar was 44 ( deg ) c ) and dark gray ( 48 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature which was 24 ( deg ) c, but if it was too light, as shown in the table white absorbs less heat so it would be more confortable. 
3822	10	0	0	Keep the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average temperature for the light gray was average 45 ( deg ) c in the first trail the black lids average was 53 ( deg ) c diferanc an the dark grey was a ( n ) 6 ( deg ) less than gray, so the thermometer did not go as high
3823	10	0	0	Altough the dark colors will keep the dog house inside will be cool enough for the dog in the hotter months, but if the dog was in the dog house. According to the data collected, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, then they should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse. The white jar was an average of 11 ( deg ) c. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest paint choice for the doghouse. 
3824	10	0	0	Coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't be too cold or too warm with light gray, it will absorb more light than white, in the winter if the dog house was black it would have an average temp of 48 ( deg ) c, while the black jar was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3825	10	0	0	 could affect the doghouse because it would not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, dark gray was in the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the best choice. 
3826	10	0	0	Was only 42. 
3827	10	0	0	Light grey is best for the dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 ( deg )
3828	10	0	0	Will be at the right tempature and out of the sun or rain. White had the lowest average temperature when it was put under the light for 10 minutes. Light gray was in high mid 40 ( deg ) c so that color on the dog house that would put the dog house at a reasonable temperature so that the dog could stay warm at most times. 
3829	10	0	0	If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 48 ( deg ) c. 
3830	10	0	0	Will get warm but not hot as 53 ( deg ). The average air temperature of 48 ( deg ) and the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c. This is because dark colors absorb energy. 
3831	10	0	0	Dog comfortable while the sun was out. 
3832	10	0	0	The dark color is going to attract the energy. 
3833	10	0	0	Attracts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
3834	10	0	0	The lid and turn on the lamp. 
3835	10	0	0	Fur to last through winer so you would want to paint the dog house white because its is alight color and it would be hot in it like in the experiment they had found out that, painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house it's going to be really hot, it would absorb more heat then light colors. 
3836	10	0	0	The perfect temapture for the dog. 
3837	10	0	0	The middle if its a mixture. 
3838	10	0	0	Average temp of 42 ( deg ), the cooler the temperature is inside, especially after more than 10 minutes. Light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot. 
3839	10	0	0	Sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because the ""hot lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter energy, so the doghouse will be located outside, the table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler, so if it is hot out side and the inside of the dog house hot. That is why light gray would be the best color. 
3840	10	0	0	Tempature would probably be around 40-50 ( deg ) because the light gray is 45 ( deg ) c, while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53 ( deg ) c versus the black lid which had an average tempurature of 53. 25 ( deg ) c in the dog house so there would be an avarge of about 12 ( deg ) warmer than the white colored house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat. Also, white and grey. 
3841	10	0	0	You had a dog with a lot of heat and it will make it absorb more enerrgy, 
3842	10	0	0	Much absorb energy in it's house. 
3843	10	0	0	During cold nights and the winters. 
3844	10	0	0	Becuase in the experiment the results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement. 
3845	10	0	0	To cool down. 
3846	10	0	0	A paint for a doghouse. 
3847	10	0	0	Color to pain the dog house white because it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
3848	10	0	0	Most heat on the inside. In the summer than the dog house the most. In the experiment out of the 4 colores the air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid had the highest average of 53 c ( deg ) dark gray: average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c which i snt to hot or cold in the dog house and keep it warm, but not hot. Then when the dog goes inside it wont be so hot because of the shade
3849	10	0	0	Making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot
3850	10	0	0	Jar to be higher. The dog house would be very cold. And dark grey is just right. 
3851	10	0	0	Affect it by the temperature of the doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat then light color s as shown in the data table it shows that the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was 42 ( deg ) c. Black's average was 53 ( deg ) c. The black would make the air inside the jar was adn average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
3852	10	0	0	Dark gray could be the color because it had the lowest average temperature so it would be the bes tone because it affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will kep the dog warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint then the dog house will be warm. 
3853	10	0	0	Winter it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldn't be to hot. The reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther. 
3854	10	0	0	The average temrature was only 42 ( deg ) c ). This could make it more comfertable for the dog. 
3855	10	0	0	 otherwise they should use white paint for there dog house because in jerry and brandi's experiment, the inside could in fact overheat. Also in the summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house. 
3856	10	0	0	End black would effect the doghouse because the lighter the doghouse is the white beacuse it was the one that had the coolest tempature, because the black color will absorb the heat from the top of the doghouse white. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more energy than lighter colors. 
3857	10	0	0	The dark gray average temperature was 48 ( deg ) c and the coldest for black was 52 ( deg ). Using the color white would. The dog in the hotter months, but a dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the dog house will be cooler for the dog which would make the dog house a darker color it will have a warmer. The darker the lid is the butter
3858	10	0	0	Dark colors obsorb more heat then light gray and white but cooler than the average temperature for light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. 
3859	10	0	0	Nice shade of white with alight coat of grey on the inside of the jar was white. 
3860	10	0	0	Would not asorb the heatness like the color black and it wont effect inside the dog house, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the dog house less hot. So, in the experiment the white colored jar had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c ) or get a little colder, but it will also create heat when it is cold out. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler inside
3861	10	0	0	Be outside and cool during summer
3862	10	0	0	Heat than a white or light gray and not too hot for the dog to stay warmer, when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer so to keep the dog warm, neither too cold, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool temperature ( about 42 ( deg ) c
3863	10	0	0	Black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the light gray would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog cool enough to withstand the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur, they would paint the doghouse white than it would be if it was black it would attract more light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more heat than white or light gray. 
3864	10	0	0	Temperature will be the lowest of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer and black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm. Your dog will be warm during winter so that the dog will be comfortable
3865	10	0	0	Warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 ( deg ) c and inside the black lid it was 53. It shows the black paint will trap more heat inside. In the winter if the doghouse was painted black. Black absorbs more energy compared to the other temperatures. Based on the data i think light grey would be a good color, the more increase in air temperature then the other colors for the dog house
3866	10	0	0	White colored doghouse is the best color for the doghouse because it would warm up the dog house by keeping the air warm and cold so it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house cooler inside because it doesn't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can not burn up. Th edark gray is also like the black so that wont work either. Alight gray house would repel heat in the summer to keep the dog warm in its dog house. 
3867	10	0	0	The dog gets hot, so i am choosing white. In teh data table from their experiment, the results from the experiment. If the tempature was 24 ( deg ), and black was 53 ( deg ) c, 52 ( deg ) c-54 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) c compared to the other colors. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48 ( deg ) c ), if they use black paint on the doghouse will absorb the heat from the top of the doghouse will have an increase in temperature, the black lid let in an average of 53 ( deg ) c ) in the summer when it is hot and sunny. However, the warmer it will be inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53 ( deg ) c and the light gray lid inside the glass jar with the black lid, the tempature inside the dog house. 
3868	10	0	0	Wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the winter it could stay warm. As you can see the lighter the color of the dog house because the result in the experiment was 42 ( deg ) and white got an average of 42 ( deg ) c ). 
3869	10	0	0	And makes the dog house have light in it. If the outside was black the dog house would keeps orta cool, i think it would be best to keep the dog warm and not cold
3870	10	0	0	Would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot or too cold. The black color would keep the dog cool but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house. 
3871	10	0	0	 causing the doghouse to be at a relaxing temperature which is 45 ( deg ) c for light gray paint. In conclusion white would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool and not get to hot. The data shows that the color white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it warmer but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
3872	10	0	0	A white lid after ten minutes the jar with the white lid had an average of 53 ( deg ) c while the highest was 46 ( deg ) c on average in the experement at 42 ( deg ) c is too cold for a dog living in a black doghouse, i would choose to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much ehat energy as a black doghouse would make the inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know this because the data tells you that the lighter the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog house would make it nuetral inside because it stayed the same temperature. 
3873	10	0	0	Keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
3874	10	0	0	Doghouse by makeing it hotter. 
3875	10	0	0	Dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold, making it more comfortable for the dogs inside. 
3876	10	0	0	Be more lighter. During the experiment the black lid color had an average of 53 ( deg ) c
3877	10	0	0	Mostly because its an energy transfer. When brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid on a glass jar. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c. 
3878	10	0	0	You would want the dog house to be warmer, when they tested the lid color black, dark gray had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold
3879	10	0	0	Diffrence between white and black was 12 ( deg ) higher than the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp. The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other colors. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45 ( deg )
3880	10	0	0	To have it cold and freezing. Brandi and jerry's dog could cool down. 
3881	10	0	0	So much heat, because black had an avrage of 53 ( deg ) c and the others were in the low 40's, and white reflects light so that is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and its not to dark and its not too cold for the dog and if it is white then the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog
3882	10	0	0	Is the lowest while the black had 54 ( deg ) c for the light gray was 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 43 ( deg ) c, which went from 24 ( deg ) c as compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average 42 c ( deg )
3883	10	0	0	Best to keep the dog warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog warm, the average temp for black is 53 ( deg ), the darker the color the cooler the tempurature was. 
3884	10	0	0	Go in his dog house. If they use dark gray then it would be with the color white and with black it would be hotter, the doghouse would not be to hot or to cold. 
3885	10	0	0	Results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature. 
3886	10	0	0	The average was the warmest with 53 ( deg ) c. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside a little wwarmer. 
3887	10	0	0	Would pick white paint to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42 ( deg ) c. Therefor, the black paint would make the inside of the dog house cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. The average temperature inside the glass jar will be. 
3888	10	0	0	The took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. It is the best paint color to use because it would keep it the right temperature. In the experiment, white would be the best color for coolness instead of hot, id want it to be warm inside. In all 3 trials it only got up to 43 ( deg ) where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 ( deg ) c and is because white is made up of all the colors tested, white was the best. Its a perfect temperature for the dog. 
3889	10	0	0	Allow it to be coler then bieng hot. 
3890	10	0	0	Energy that the lighter colors
3891	10	0	0	White whos was 42 ( deg ). Meanwhile, the black on the doghouse should make it warmer. The light gray was 45. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a cold place and want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too hot and your dog will be hot aswell. As the colors got darker, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c, which proves the white is cooler. 
3892	10	0	0	To choose the black color inside the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed. 
3893	10	0	0	Use black because since black is a dark color to absorb some light. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
3894	10	0	0	Heated up inside the dog house would be cold but for the dog which would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would not matter how dark the paint is. 
3895	10	0	0	Warmer on summer days. 
3896	10	0	0	Solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the darkest color and had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 ( deg ) c and light gray at 44 ( deg ). And in the winter would be nice because it would attract the heat and keep the dog house warmer inside. I know this because in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest color was white, the temperature will never be too hot or too cold for the dog. 
3897	10	0	0	And the trials number are 54 ( deg ) c, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat, so the dog would be cold. So black wouldnt be a good color, but not really warm. 
3898	10	0	0	To like in. 
3899	10	0	0	 light gray would be perfect, because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the most thermal heat. Therefore to keep the inside of the dog house at a good temperature of 45 ( deg ) c hotter! 
3900	10	0	0	Will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it white the doghouse will be warmer. 
3901	10	0	0	To use black, dark gray, black would be the best color, the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature, not to get even more hot. 
3902	10	0	0	House would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48 ( deg ) c. The light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on. 
3903	10	0	0	The trial the black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. The dark gray got up to 48 ( deg ) c
3904	10	0	0	Comfortable on the inside. From the investigation for the air temperature, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog wouldnt be able to see it in the night. 
3905	10	0	0	The doghouse black than the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexs sun
3906	10	0	0	Was 42 degrees celcius. 
3907	10	0	0	Going be very hot inside the dog house. 
3908	10	0	0	The winter when it gets cold. When they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24 ( deg ) c. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. If they want cool for the doghouse then use the white. I say this because in the experiment it shows that with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, dark gray and light gray lids were 53 ( deg ) c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on the dog so if you paint the entire doghouse white then it will atracts less heat. 
3909	10	0	0	The experiment support my desicion because in the experiment, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. And with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm, but not that light ether. For the lowest color, the paint will not asborb as much energy so the dog will be cooler inside. 
3910	10	0	0	Wont affect the doghouse because, lesser air will go inside the doghouse. 
3911	10	0	0	Making the object warmer. 
3912	10	0	0	Retaned at night to keep him/her warm
3913	10	0	0	Will cang the air pressure in side
3914	10	0	0	Would stay at one degree. So therefore the dark gray would be the best for the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to briet for the dog. 
3915	10	0	0	White will absorb barley any heat. So light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling. 
3916	10	0	0	The average when white was 42 ( deg ) light grey is the average of them all. 
3917	10	0	0	Lid was avaraged 54 ( deg ) for the black lid. Thus, overheating is not an issue. 
3918	10	0	0	Cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
3919	10	0	0	Some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make the dog warmer. 
3920	10	0	0	Rise an average of 48 ( deg ) )
3921	10	0	0	It will become light in there because if you have a dark color the light will make it hot in the winter but in the summer it will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it white. 
3922	10	0	0	Effect the in side of the dog house would be cooler and not has hot as a black or darker color dog house would be white. The temperature used for explanation was the average. 
3923	10	0	0	Expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color. So its not too warm for the dog to be cold at night and to hot during the summer, because of the theory that darker colors absorbs more energy, causing the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse too cold, because if the dog house was painted black. 
3924	10	0	0	Too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black. Therefore, the tempature inside the glass jar for the lid color white could make a difference between the black lid and the glass jar with the black lid was over the thermometer and the light was 5 centimeters away, the greater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse. 
3925	10	0	0	Nor to hot. 
3926	10	0	0	Was colder than black and the rest of the colors. In jar before starting exp. Responding:air temp. For example, in the winter if the dog house is made it will be warm. 
3927	10	0	0	Dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun the dog house will be very cool
3928	10	0	0	Because their all 48in all different procdures
3929	10	0	0	The doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it would be too hot. Also, it is around normal temperature. The white lid got the least hot, because 'dark colors absorb more light', and ideal for a doghouse. 
3930	10	0	0	Because since black is a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more energy
3931	10	0	0	Choice to the expirement when they used black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature. On average, only went up to an average of 45 ( deg ) c, but did not increase too much like the dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
3932	10	0	0	Lid was 42 and for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the lowest temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. Inside the dog house will be too hot. With the white lid. 
3933	10	0	0	Be cold like a white dog house would be white because white is alight color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will. 
3934	10	0	0	Not atract as much heat as dark gray, and the average for the white paint, the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 ( deg ) c )
3935	10	0	0	Maintaing an consistent temperature all year long. 
3936	10	0	0	Dog hose cool in the sun. Making white the best suited color for the doghouse. I know this because from the data that was the color that the inside of the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
3937	10	0	0	House the average temperature would be 53 ( deg ) c for black. I know this because in the experiment it was 53 ( deg ) c, the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. One reason i chose this is because when the sun was up it would maintain 44 ( deg ) c, therefore, creating a safe doghouse habitat. 
3938	10	0	0	Will atract so much heat
3939	10	0	0	A white color would keep it cooler in the dog house. 
3940	10	0	0	House cooler than the darkgrey and black color. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the house will get so i picked dark gray because in the winter gray is kinda dark it will be warm but it will retain it's heat. 
3941	10	0	0	Tempature would probably be around 40-50 ( deg ) because the light gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside. And the average for white is the coolest color and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house. 
3942	10	0	0	Black dog house the dog house would be both warm and cool down. 
3943	10	0	0	The doghouse because in the results the average for light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. So dark gray would work perfectly in my opinion. It will be 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid was 53 celcius. 
3944	10	0	0	White because darker colors absorb more energy. 
3945	10	0	0	Color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so alight gray color would be good for the dog. 53 ( deg ) c, compared to black's average, while white only heated up the air in the jar that had the white lid was an average of 11 ( deg ) difference. 
3946	10	0	0	Coolest temperature inside the jar of 42 ( deg ) c. When brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. While light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. 
3947	10	0	0	White lid is 42 ( deg ) c. In the data, in my opinion. 
3948	10	0	0	T empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would be best because it would not be too hot. So therefore the inside of the doghouse wont be so hot. &#916;
3949	10	0	0	Dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 ( deg ) c. That would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature. So this proves that the darker the color there is. Also, another example is in the summer time the dog house won't get too hot during the day, and the darker the color that more heat it absorbs. That is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c. This is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53 while the other colors were 10 ( deg ) cooler than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the winter it will not matter because there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. The black lid increased the air temperature by 29 ( deg ) c ). 
3950	10	0	0	Had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44 ( deg ) c, which is what you want for a doghouse. 
3951	10	0	0	Warmer inside than any other colors above thus, because it will keep the dog warmer. 
3952	10	0	0	Four lid colors that were used in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature. A white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other color. 
3953	10	0	0	The dog was a hairless one then it would be with the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 45 ( deg ) c, aand the white had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is why light gray would be a good color to paint the dog house white, because blacks average ( in ( deg ) c, 54, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were black because darker colors absorb more heat then light colors. 
3954	10	0	0	The experiment that brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white, what would u pick? 
3955	10	0	0	The heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm. Dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
3956	10	0	0	The color that regects all light there for keeping the dog cool in the summer, but not to hot for the dog, because then, the temperature will never be too hot or too cold. 
3957	10	0	0	In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, it would be right in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too warm for the dog. 
3958	10	0	0	Dog house black, brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black if they want the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 ( deg ) c and gray was 45 ( deg ) c, which would be a health issue for the dog. 
3959	10	0	0	Built a dog house dark gray, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay cool in. It blocks about 30% more heat than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house. 
3960	10	0	0	Doghouse and if the dog house was white then the air temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c and dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c and the white average of 41-43. The average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c. The only options left are dark gray and light gray had averages of 48 ( deg ) c. Unlike the color black. Also in the data table it had higher degree then white, be cause white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat. The shades of gray and the black paint caused the jar to at least get up to 45 ( deg ) and when it was white the inside would be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. 
3961	10	0	0	That the color absorbs, causing the inside of the dog house because it would make the dog too hot. But with the heat coming off from the dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. Dark grayis not a too dark color but not a too light color either. 
3962	10	0	0	Is shinning it is usually warm outside, the black lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c while white averaged 42 ( deg ) c. 
3963	10	0	0	Dog to live in. 
3964	10	0	0	Based the color. The white would keep the dog very hot. The white color had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, but remain warm in the winter. The color will change lighter. 
3965	10	0	0	The dogs warm, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be warmer, decreasing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduction of heat energy from the sun, which will transform into thermal energy
3966	10	0	0	In the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i think white should be what they choose. 
3967	10	0	0	That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold, it's just about in the middle which was 45 ( deg ) c, light gray and white paint would. The dog will want to use it to cool off. 
3968	10	0	0	And in the end it would bw cooler for the dog in his new dog house. 
3969	10	0	0	Reason i would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the inside of the dog house by making it more ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
3970	10	0	0	The white the temperature droped to an average of 53 ( deg ). If the doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If you painted the outside of a dog-house, then if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the same at all times
3971	10	0	0	House because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat. 
3972	10	0	0	Went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark as black so it wont get too warm. The average for dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c, while the white lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c is to cold and too hot so make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house. 
3973	10	0	0	At the same temperture every trial. Dark gray would have done the same thing as black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. If the tempature was 24 ( deg ). This is because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun. 
3974	10	0	0	Sun or any heat because darker colors attract more heat than light colors do. 
3975	10	0	0	Cool for the dogs temperature. In the experiment, the greatest increase in temperature because darker colors absorb more heat, white would be the best color to paint the doghouse the color white, might affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but for the winter it would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted white, but also the suitable conditions for a dog. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 53 ( deg ) c. 
3976	10	0	0	House does not get to hot or to cold it would be in the low forties. If the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer, if its hot outside the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm in the winter, and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house. Then at night the dog house will be nice a cool because if you use this color the dog house will be cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average tempature of 45 ( deg ) c and the black lid's average temp. Of 42 ( deg ) while black was 54 ( deg ) c but a dog house would be cooler for the dog in the winter time as if you were to use black, dark gray:48 ( deg ) c. 
3977	10	0	0	 i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
3978	10	0	0	As black would. 
3979	10	0	0	Data given by brandi and jerry's expirement. 
3980	10	0	0	Amount of heat for the summer time when it's hot, it will keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light and would keep the dog house coler than all the other coior
3981	10	0	0	Because the temperature will be lower than light gray, white is the coolest tempature ( 42 ( deg ) after ten minutes. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun. In the experiment it was the coldest so in the summer, but it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house was white the inside of the doghouse because it would stay at a higher constant temperature. This, we wouldn't want the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse. With the paint color as white the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. Black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Evidently, black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray, which was 5 ( deg ) c, the warmer the air temperature inside the jar is 24° c. 
3982	10	0	0	It will heat up the doghouse ). 
3983	10	0	0	Much heat energy will be absorbed. Light gray will keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days. Based on brandi and jerry's experiment, the white color reflects sunlight, therefore having the lowest temperature aver age. This because the light grey is perfect. Say that its a could wet day. The dog is really could. The average tempature for the jar with the white lid had an increased temperature of 18 ( deg ) c for the summer and da winter, which is warmer than the other colors. 
3984	10	0	0	Colour to paint a dog house based on the results in the experiment white had the coolest. Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog house cool and not to hot and it wouldn't be to cold at 42 ( deg ) c and the others were 53, 48, and with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c and it was the lighest color. The highest temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. 
3985	10	0	0	Will not go in the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler. In the experiment, black had an average of 45 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature inside the doghouse. 
3986	10	0	0	Dog sitting in that. I think this because on the experiment they did, the dark gray color would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible. 
3987	10	0	0	Air in it the least. In the experiment with the effects of color on temperature, not too hot and not too cold. The dog will want to stay warm, light gray 45 ( deg ) c. So the dog house was white then when it is hot the dog house will affect the temperature of the air was 53 ( deg ) c. The results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not absorb to much energy, but will retain some heat in the winter, so light gray would be best because it would keep it warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the results of the hot lamp experiment was 42 ( deg ) c. This is because in the experiment, the black lid was 53 celcius. 
3988	10	0	0	Light gray is warmer than white lid, and cool in the summer because the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( deg ) c. If the outside was black the dog house would stay much cooler on the inside. 
3989	10	0	0	Ture so it wouldent be to hot or sufficate in the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. In the lab, the jar with the black lid was 53 ( deg ), light grey 45, 48, and warm enough during the winter. Some evidence is that in the data table it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be cold all the time
3990	10	0	0	Then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm but not too warm inside. In the lab, the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint, was an average of 11 ( deg ) c from lowest average to higest average. 
3991	10	0	0	The lid experment, the temperature in the dog house because, it had an averge of 42 degrees. There for the best choice would be the color to choose
3992	10	0	0	Degrees on an avergae is better
3993	10	0	0	And maybe in the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot. Then later, during the summer, white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
3994	10	0	0	By the out side where the sun hits will affect the in side of the doghouse by making it colder. A black house might absorb too much heat since in the data the average temperature for light gray is a good color to choose because it won't be to cold nor to hot. In the experiment it had the highest of the average tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c, which is 53 c ( average ) would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray. 
3995	10	0	0	Attract as mutch heat from the sun. 
3996	10	0	0	That after just 10 minutes was 42 ( deg ) on average, the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog year around. 
3997	10	0	0	Still be too warm. Then when the sun is shining down on the doghouse, it would be a good color because it wouldn't be to cold. In the experament, the jar with the black lid was an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not be too hot or too cold
3998	10	0	0	A doghouse would absorb more heat like the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
3999	10	0	0	Sweat a lot.
