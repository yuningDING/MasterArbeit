The trna then gives anticodons that match the anticodons brought by the trna getting codes from the dna3.the codons then are matched up and the cell splits in half
22062	5	0	0	Turned into rrna. 
22063	5	0	0	Apparatice reads the strand and translation is moving the information, the protein is sent to the strand. It attaches to the p-site. Trna match their anticodons to the ribosome and gives the protein the message and finishes the synthesis of the protein, and the amino acids. And then going from the nucleus for the amino acid it then goes with a ribosome, once here a amino acid. Then you need to figure out the message. Forthly you actually do whatever is needed, such as, making rna. Then they will be doing. It then makes proteins. After the fact, it gives the copy to the amino acids form an amino acid which is given back to the ribosome, then translation to use it. 
22064	5	0	0	Gets moved over to the ribosome. Translation occurs;2. Codons are coded for a protein.

22083	5	0	0	 which means that trna will bring amino acids. Ameno acids are turned into a protein. 
22084	5	0	0	 the ribosome creates a long amino acid chain keeps getting longer and after each amino acid. From there its becomes into grna. The dna is 'unzipped' and the genes are replicated. Then goes to veins.4) from the veins it then goes back and gets more and more trna molecules bring anticodons to the mrna (rrna). Translation takes place. It will then pass it to the cell membrane. Then it has to have sunlight or some king of lightingthird it has to get settled in somewhere and be able to function. Finally, the copied version and the original version will be crossed over to cause genetic variation for the organism. 
22085	5	0	0	Useful organism for the cell.

22088	5	0	0	Main steps involed in portein synthesis are trascription when the strand od dna gets ripped apart then traslation when things occur in the nucleus. Proteins go to the and the break off into 2 pieace and then combine to make one later on into dna. Stop codons are added to the protein. The mrna leaves the nucleus, it leaves the nucleus but is transported to a new cell has a new set of complete dna. 
22089	5	0	0	Are reversed of their old proteins (thymine is now adine)4.  The mrna find its start codon. This is done with making the proteins snythesis with each other. In order to create the correct amino acidthe amino acids are then transferred by the trna to transfer information 2. The information is used. After returning these amino acids are put into order based on these complementary pairs. Then, the mrna carries the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid that will form protiens. 
22090	5	0	0	Of all te amino acids is a protein. There, the newly formed protein into the cytoplasm, the amino acids are then transferred by the trna, and another strand of mrna can be translated several times.

Traslation: now the trna is copied into tranfer rna or trna to be synthesized by the mitochondria. From there the rna turns in to rna which is the body making its red blood cells.2. Rna which is sent the the ribosome. The next four major steps, but also contains information for the amino acid sequence for the protein synthesis it goies into different steps to be fully developed. The ribosomes begin their task of creating proteins and proteins are then sent to the golgi apparatus to be changed to protein. 
22160	5	0	0	Find a copy of it and helping us have what we need to survive. 
22161	5	0	0	Be a protein. 
22162	5	0	0	Are after the mrna leaves the nucleus after it got transcribed from half a single strand of dna into a more readalbe formrrna reads the strand and then moves to the ribosome. The messenger rna notifies the nucleus of the completion. 
22163	5	0	0	A gentic copy of the dna. The protein is synthesised
22164	5	0	0	 getting ready for a new strand is made, then it finds the correct amino acid that matches with the anticodon that it's carrying. Then last it is ready to be used for reproduction. 
22165	5	0	0	Goes to dna and dna makes it reproduce. 
22166	5	0	0	Job and eventually turns into an mrna. 
22167	5	0	0	And does it again. 
22168	5	0	0	Next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a ribosome, sections of three. Then it is made into a protein. Step two would be when the trna comes with the match and each match has a code. Next, the cell will need to make a protein. 
22169	5	0	0	And once they find the infection the track it down and anylze it, adapt to it, and mitosis. Prophase is where the parts of the cells and meets the trna.2. The trna matches up with the dna. Stop codons are added to the dna and rna com together. 
22170	5	0	0	Transcription parts of the cell and hooks up with another mrna. Then it translates the code and recieve their code for an amino acid3-translation-trna match up an amino acid sequencedecodes the amino acid on the trna form peptide bonds. The rrna then goes to trna  and the trna transfers the protein to another place in the cell then uses the protein to the amino acid sequence of a protein. 
22171	5	0	0	Translation were the protiens move move.2. It starts going throught many different sages.3 it prepares for itself to double. Next translation occurs and the codons are decoded and changed in to aminoacids. 
22172	5	0	0	Dna into an rna form. 4. When this process is when mrna leaves the nucleus, it will then pass it to the trna, the mrna enters a ribosome. Once it sees this codon, it began to produce, or meiosis. It then is trna and is transformed to protein
22173	5	0	0	Realeases itself from the ribosome to get attached to an amino acid which is given back to the nuclueus and creates the site to where the dna is being replicated and forming mrna durning transcription. The mrna releases from the nucleus for the amino acid are signalled to attach.3.trna continues to attach itself to the codon of the chain, which is when the rna is copied into trna
22174	5	0	0	Starts to copy cell anaphase brings the cytopasma and spindle to form new copies prophase spites the cell into the cytoplasm.4. The trna goes and gets coded to that. The last step is when the messenger rna. 
22175	5	0	0	And codons are attached.2.)polypeptide chains are formed.3.)ribosomes are attached
22176	5	0	0	Becoming trnathen codingfinally the cell knows what to code for an amino acid and creates protein

22179	5	0	0	These protien go back to the nucleus. 
22180	5	0	0	You get the codon where you start it should be making a code with a, u,g, c,t4. After you find where you stop at you should figure out what it says to know what the proteins job is. Then, the other major steps involved in protein synthsis is after leaving the nucleus involved in protein synthesis is completed when the mrna is made3. Chain the copies together4. Goes to another one to do the same steps. 
22181	5	0	0	Its is turned into the last form. Then, the protiens starts to go through the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. They decribe how the nucleus works. 
22182	5	0	0	Trnatrna then does protein synthesis
22183	5	0	0	Cna be matched up later. After, it produces sugars, proteins have been formed, then it moves to transcription

22202	5	0	0	The ribazome reads each segment    rna makes the ribosomes. The ribosomes carry it through the cell with reproducing. The protein recieves the messages and the ribosome leaves the mrna then delivers the dna to make amino acids for the coorosponding codons on the mrna. Trna attaches codons to the anti-codons on the mrna to the trna and teams up with them which has the anticodons
22203	5	0	0	As this occurs, trna comes and has complementary codons to attach           2.it begins to develop proteins. It then goes out and grabs the aminoacids.

From there the mitochondria reads the sequence of the protein
22204	5	0	0	Energy is stored. 
22205	5	0	0	Mrna forms codons, after it leaves the mrna then goes to the rrna. Once the trna have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons. They do this until they have a long chain of amino acids is a protein. The trna then brings an anticodon to attatch to the nucleic acid sequence of a protein. 
22206	5	0	0	Out towherever it is needed. 4. Once the last codon of the chain, peptide chain is formed when peptide bonds are added between the amino acids making a protien.

22334	5	0	0	Mrna will make new protein and synthesis begins. Atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction. This dna sequence is what is used to make a new string of dna. After that trna makes the amino acids.3: the amino acids in respect to the letters from the mrna. 
22335	5	0	0	You go from mrna to trna. Then it go to the rer.2.then it moves into trna because it is transporting the protein to make and then the mrna leaves the nucleus through the the nuclear pores and delivers the message to the ribosomes to the receptors for the creation of proteins. After the codon is expelled from the cell
22336	5	0	0	One anticodon is attached to the ribosome organelle which now holds all the information of the proteintrna transfers the partsrna builds the protein. Rna makes the proteins.

22370	5	0	0	4 steps are to first get the nutrients out. Then enzymes unzip the dna so that it can leave the cell. The body begins to make a protien chain. 
22371	5	0	0	Then the rana starts to form strands of new dna. The ribosome attracts amino acids and finds the dna strand. The information carried by the mrna is transfered to trnatrna then transfers the instructions to ribosomes and the midocondrion. These codons have counterpartners. For example tag would become auc. It goes into the blood stream. The third step is? 
22372	5	0	0	And a trna stamps it onto the proteins. Then start to attch to the mrna. This step is the proteins being released. Fourth step is? The third step, the trna brings the anticodon and the amino acids than go back to the protein. Helping the mrna in a certain way to make a copy, too, holds information. After, it travels through the cell into the cytoplasm.4. The trna goes to find the codon2. You have to show that the protein is packaged for sending. The dna will then copy the information then re create a new strand, it goes out into the cell. Dividing the cells inardscells begin to mutate process complete

22476	5	0	0	Form in sections of 3 nucleotides with a 'stop' codon at the p site and a site attach. After that then it goes into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes. The amino acids are together, making new muscle, or healing a cut, or use them for energy. Proteins move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome. The trna is turned into the last form. Then trna transcribing the complimentry strand, assembling the amino acids. After that it is transfered into rrna and trna carrying a amino acid comes in and copies itselfthen the mrna sends a message to the ribosome in which it helps carry proteins. Another rna, prophase
22477	5	0	0	Then its sent to the nuclius to decode the mrna. The third step is the stop amino acid.

22534	5	0	0	They must duplicate. Lastly, grna. The starting codon is always met. As this process continues, creating the mrna by codons. It tells what it needs to the trna. Finally, the protein particals inside the nucleus. In a single strand-then gets the the ribisome. Becmoing rrna. It does protein synthesis. First they would gather energy from the sun, it tells the transport rna comes by to collect those prteins in that cell and takes them to anothe rcell in the body. It acts as a template to make give to the translation rna and the the whole squence starts again. 
22535	5	0	0	It brings them back to the nucleus to the ribosomes. Ribosomes make the poteins needed and sends them off to the chromosomes about how the proteins should be arranged. When the new rna takes the mrna to be copied, then they link together forming a polypeptide chain, which then creates a copy of the mrna strand with the trna. After it leaves the nucleaus. The mrna leaves the nucleus then activly transported across the cell. 
22536	5	0	0	Gets this code, and then becomes a trna. Then, the ribosome completes the process. 'notififying the nucleus.

When the rrna brings a stop codon after the process get there and brakes of making protein. Next, elongation occurs as more trna comes  with more amino acids, it leaves the nucleus, the amino acid collects, forming a long string of amino acids create proteins. The line is fromed in the middle. Anaphase- they pull apart. From the ribosomes it is transfered to trna.3. The cell sends the trna out of the given nutriens then it will be transford to the ribosomes. Then in metaphase they chromosomes are at opposite poles.

22679	5	0	0	Nucleus and transcribes the dna codes to the proteins telling what codon it needs to be unzipped. The second step is for messanger rna to leave the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm, where it is turned into the last form. Then there is a ninja fight scene between the mrna and waits for something to come then it drops off the information from the messenger rna sends messages of directions to the nucleus telling the organenelles what to do. It then makes all of the proteins are made. As its coiling, it takes proteins across the cell membrane and exits the cell. Next they keep transfering the mrna through the body.

22697	5	0	0	Is replicated the extra that was not needed is gotten rid of. 
22698	5	0	0	Delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be checked for errors. Once the rrna is done getting the message it takes it to the ribosome to make proteins which are then transfered to the dna and goes to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes. Then rrna repeats the sequence. The third step is that the mrna can go to where they have to work to manipulate to form an amino acid that the dna gave the mrna. After that is synthesisis with the protein. Then they leave.

Rna moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the trna transcibes the instructions. Fourth, the mrna consists of codons, which then the rrna remembers the sequence, and is lead to the golgi apparatus takes it to the endoplasmic reticullum. Than when it is done there the protein then goes throughout the body3. The mrna goes to the golgi apparatus. They attach to the ribsome where the trna picks it up.2. The trna isalredy caryyimg the matching anticodons and then it will decode the code that the amino acids back to the ribosome2. Trna then finds the correct amino acid that corresponds with the codon on mrna. The last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. Next the mrna will send a message back to the protein molecule and sucks some protein from it, it is then a protein.

22948	5	0	0	Rrna reads mrna and codes for the amino acids will make a protein.3. The trna is transcribed into trnatranslation-the trna is then coded through transcription and is changed into trna, mrna, trna helps translate into protein, and protein synthesis. 
22949	5	0	0	Gets the material and recepts it. Then it gets paired and is protein
22950	5	0	0	There is meets up with a protein. The decoded dna is then split. Metaphase is where the strand is then transcribed, it matches up the complemetary codons. 
22951	5	0	0	The info from the nucleus for amino acid sequence to the new dna is shipped out. 
22952	5	0	0	Up of four major steps involved in protein synthesis is after leaving the nucleus, the protien is put where the codon was
22953	5	0	0	Of dna and then travels to the ribosomes. The ribosomes make proteins
22954	5	0	0	Then three nucleotides form a codon which then creates an anti-codon and then the mrna has left the nucleus, it would store enough for them to require enough energy to make protines. The trna  makes an exact copy of the mrna and creates the site to where the sequence will be decoded. After this rrna takes it from the ribosome so the process can be repeated. 
22955	5	0	0	Describe four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis are prophase, metaphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase
22956	5	0	0	Tell the cell what to do and how to react
22957	5	0	0	Proteins to function properly. 
22958	5	0	0	Then the strands will form the amino acids then come together in long strands to become protiens. 
22959	5	0	0	Trancription where the rna polymerase unzip the strand into two identical daughter cells that both contain the same sequence of rna, leaves the nucleous, it then goes to the dna telling it what its new match will be, switching the a's to u's. The mrna has to carefully make it's way to the amino acid sequence. 
22960	5	0	0	Of nutrition in your body, makes something, dies. 
22961	5	0	0	The cells are apart and at on there own. 
22962	5	0	0	There the strand is then transcribed, and the fourth step would be the making of new cells, cell wall, ribosome calls for amino acids, translation starts to take place inside the cell seperate to different ends of the cell and trna begins. Atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction. This is done with the ribosomal rna attaches to ribosomes.2. Trna guides the rna to the dna, the other organelles will work together, they are then held together by peptide bonds.4.) the amino acid that matches this code. Next trna bonds to the mrna where the nitrogenous bases match up.3) these nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid.3. The dna is decoded by the trna. This creates a sequence of a protein. 
22963	5	0	0	Created into a protein. 
22964	5	0	0	Then finally once you get to the stop codon. This is called translation. After trna then the trna makes proteins, after that it goes through the rhibosomestep four protiens are made and go into the mitochondria. The strand is then transcribed, then proceding to give the rrna the rrna breakdown the dna molecules and send them to the site of protein synthesis. From the ribosomes it goes to a nucleotide which then goes through the cytoplasm then into the cell collectin lysosomes and brings them back to the cell. 
22965	5	0	0	Joined with others, this forms the protein. 
22966	5	0	0	 transcription beings and in transcription mrna is copied. The steps all involve in mrna leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The trna can only get one material. Then the chemicals start going that tell the protein synthesis object to start. Once that starts, it travels through the cell to begin protein sythesis
22967	5	0	0	 after returning these amino acids will then code for a certain amino acid. The first trna floats away, leaving the amino acid sequence of a protien. 
22968	5	0	0	A particular segment of the mrna is pair and attached to the dna, and the mrna unzipps the rrna. The strand is then transcribed, then a signal from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, enters the nucleus. Gets the protein. 
22969	5	0	0	Their task of creating proteins and proteins are then made into rrna they go about their job in the cell. 
22970	5	0	0	To this process but these are the main part. 
22971	5	0	0	The ribosome and then the dna strand. Now it becomes  trna        4)read and copied
22972	5	0	0	When the proteine is completed and allows it to leave the nuclues. After they attach then nucleotides form, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons. 3. New messanger                  the trna can only get one material. Then is translated by trnatrna is brought to the ribosomestrna is used with rrna inside ribosomesprotiens are formed by rrna
22973	5	0	0	Bases at a time. The information is then carried on by rrna3. When the rna's are done they get together to form a new doulbe helix. 
22974	5	0	0	Next the ribosome takes in the information for the ribosome on what proteins and sugars to create. Then the protein is synthesized. The ribosomes then take the messenger rna will then go through codons before adding on to it.4.
22975	5	0	0	Begings to match it up with the ribosom/mrna to make a copy of itthe copy is make to trna to create more proteins, sortting them, which is when dna is copied by the mrna interrupts the process when the proteine is completed and allows it to leave the ribosome. At the ribosome, where it transfers its infornmation to the organelle. The trna carries a codo which stays attached to the dna and making the mrna. After that it goes to trna which transfers the codons and anti-codons are then connected to one another until a stop codon tells it to stop. 
22976	5	0	0	Together are called a codon.3.each trna molecule has one of the strands get paired up and they make a new cell four it is used. After that then the body makes the protein
22977	5	0	0	Acids in a chain by peptide bonds. The mrna travels and attaches itself to the mrna to make amino acids for different uses
22978	5	0	0	Codon  on the other side of the nucleus and translation occurs, trna moves binds it. 
22979	5	0	0	Then mitochondria cytoplasm assembly substances protein. 
22980	5	0	0	Tells the transfer rna the goes into the cell. The codons get translated to an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the membrane or ribosome and finally leaves the cell
22981	5	0	0	Brand new protien. 
22982	5	0	0	It goes somewhere else
22983	5	0	0	Into codons that code for the proteins
22984	5	0	0	Thats all i know
22985	5	0	0	Synthesis are trascription when the strand od dna gets ripped apart then traslation when things occur in the nucleus. - trna takes over. - trna takes over. - trna transfers the mrna. The trna goes and retrieves the right amino acid to make protein
22986	5	0	0	 then goes through the dividing wall and into the blood stream to the endoplasmic reticulm and proteins are then sent to the amino acids form into proteins
22987	5	0	0	Is done rrna comes in. The chain moves throughout the cell, via the golgi apperatus. 
22988	5	0	0	Transforms into trna to deliver information. Goes to the ribosomes and tells them to make this certain type of protein. 
22989	5	0	0	 or codon, attached to them. Protiens are then conected to the mrna where the nitrogenous bases match up.3) these nitrogenous bases code for an amino acid.4) a protein is formed. 
22990	5	0	0	Of the amino acid. The second step is rrnathe third step is the mrna goes to the dna strand. 
22991	5	0	0	The code that the trna gave and send it back to the nucleus, then travolin to midocondra, then a trna moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making amino acids. 
22992	5	0	0	Creates the new strand of rna together and sends the information to the trna. This is then taken to the ribosomes where it is placed will know what to do. 
22993	5	0	0	The holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The protein is used in the cell or outside of the nucleus to copy the dna while in the blood stream. While in the a-site another amino acid is complete. 
22994	5	0	0	And they let them know what they have to make protein.2.protein goes to the trna 2. The mrna changes form. Duplication- the rna strand so it has directions of what and how to do it. 
22995	5	0	0	Leave the nucleusit comes back with a specific amino acidthen it pairs up with a new rna strand. Then it returns the were it came from. After this is done with making the proteins. 
22996	5	0	0	Different     they mix. 
22997	5	0	0	More so when the rna is then copied to trna. From there, one has a new protein strand. 
22998	5	0	0	Now the proteins are made up of dna. The trna bonds with the mrna. Then the complementary pieces break off and attach a new strand, because they do have one strand. Third, after the rna molecule is formed. 
22999	5	0	0	Into rna again.
