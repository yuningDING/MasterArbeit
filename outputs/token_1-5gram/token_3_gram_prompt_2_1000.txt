The students could improve this experiment could have done more trials the most in both trials. Also they would do one more trial to make the validity of the plastics had verry little change during the second trial tests only differed by 1 or decrease by 1. Telling us the types tried. The most stretchability. As you can conclude that plastic type d did not stretch at all. ^p (b) the two trials. ^p to improve the experiment is by doing it again to see how far the plastic after they were using for each plastic is being added to the end they both equal^p b- one way the student should have done to improve this lab are: have s or third trials to the clamps on the data is that plastic type got 20mm for trial t2, for the type of the results are
6003	2	0	0	Type initial measurements to certain steps such as no weights. ^p one thing the students data, and using the data. Also plastic type a was the most, and another way that the original size of the weights and clamp weighed to be is more durable and add more trials. So the data. ^p one way to improve this experiment is by ofsonbing how much of each plastic. ^p b. And lastly type a is the least stretchable, than the amount of length was the lab is that for each plastic: and two tell us how much weight they add should be a good conclution for this experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.

None of the plastic cups had stretched the most stretchability because it would have done a third trial. ^p b. Another way would be wise to msure that each plastic. Plastic type b was the best flexibility of 22-23mm. ^p b.1. The student could have improved their experiment would be that plastic type c with 14mm and t2 has the length of each plastic type b stretched the most, and they should have been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Type d were increasing, plastics b and d stretched about 12 mm. Therefore the order for this experiment is being put on the students could have done was include the plastics. 
6009	2	0	0	Stretches farther in a clearer data table, plastic a stretch 2mm more in both trials were close, there is a better mental image of it. It will stretch the least. The student should have had more trials. ^p b. Two ways the students could have improved the validity of results is on the students could improve on the student's data would be stronger. ^p b. ) the conclusion i got for the student should have tested their experement out longer and they could improved the experiment because it streched the least durability, the students can improve the expirement more valid, which has a high place.

B) two ways the student could have improved their experimental design the weights added to the clamp hang on the first trial and to tell what plastics they used to stretch the furthest. In the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by telling how much of a plastic another way could be that plastic. The con clusion i have come to a cup and then gradually get to a conclution that plastic b had the most because it had the greatest length which is farther than the other plastics. ^p (b)first, say how much weight they put the same for all i know, it is now a little. Also to add to the bottom edge. ^p b) two switch up the most stretchability, plastic type a proved to have done more than t2 but both trials. Material type b stretched the farthest meaning
6014	2	0	0	Do this experiment is plastic b was the stretchiest of all other types of plastic they should have done a trial 3, then the first trial (t1), to put heavy products in because it had stretched the most out of them was 2 or 1 difference. ^p b) the could have improved his experiment by adding more trials. Twenty two mm. B, c,d their t1 and 23mm for both trials it stretched 22 and 23mm. ^p (b) a way they can clarity what type of plastic to find out the averages to his table without the original lengths of the table, say how much weight was put on. 
6015	2	0	0	Based off of the plastics. ^p another one large and in the first trial is werent stretchable and durable this is important to specify how heavy the weights were placed could not have used something more stronger lile another clamp to stretch out a lot of work for it to procedure. 
6016	2	0	0	Farthest over all because the clamp should have kept adding weights, followed by the students data they took it down on the student's results i can make a more accurate say how much. Another way to have a control and using a different type of plastic they use and tell us the specific amount of length was in his data, and make trials to compare data to trials conclusions with another group.

Another way would be of saying 'take a sample of one plastic it will stretch with the same in t2. ^p (b) two ways the student also could of improve the experiment again, i can assume that plastic type a for t1 and t2 it went up. Explain what brand plastic he was using the same exact order and made them all the plastics and to be more accurate answers. 
6024	2	0	0	Be duct tape, they could have identified a specific length for the experiment better. 
6025	2	0	0	Equal to the procedure 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second most, and increasing the number of trials. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental validity by adding more trials can help make sure they used for each trial give or data a mm. It stayed the same amount of weight they can improve by recordin the amount of weight added to the combination of polymers. ^p b) two ways the student tested the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p (b)1.put something heavier then weights. 
6026	2	0	0	Be streched, plastic type & the second trial it stretched on average by 12 mm. In trial length so it would have been improved is saying that the results on how many weighs should be. 
6027	2	0	0	Only 1mm and in t2 it stretched 22 while type b stretched the most streachability. ^p the student could have improved the design is tell what type of plastic that stretched the farthest, a way to help improve the expirement was not done the amount stretched, the students data from the data i can conclude that plastic b stretched after being stretched. 
6028	2	0	0	Easy to stretch out a lot according to the procedure more understandable. ^p b) two ways the student data table the polymer investigation, and also specified how much tape your using and how heavy the weights are. 
6029	2	0	0	May also perform a second change would be that plastic type a can not obtain consistancy, it held the least one other person there to varify results even greator. One can only strech 20 mm. One thing he could add more trials. Also the student could have improved the validity the group could do this experiment would be a set mass of the experiment is by using a  conclusion based on the student's data is that plastics type a stretched the least stretchable with t1 being 22mm in t1 (22)and t2 (23) were the same length. Therefore we could see how each plastic start at the same weights for each trial & also by specifying the amount of weights. 
6030	2	0	0	Specific mass for the trial to the plastic may have needed was to add validity and experimental design by naming the plastics have little to no stretchability, in the experiment is by allowing the reader to follow. Also, the students data the conclusion that i draw was that the group included the measurements of the polymer) and list the starting weights put in a whole. 
6031	2	0	0	And wid therefore they start experimenting on them. So it would have told us how much weight to add them to hens for longer amount of stretchability but it did in the span of five mns and he should have added more weight to add a control. 
6032	2	0	0	Stricthed to the other one, according to the clamp. 
6033	2	0	0	2mm more after the first trial and also to use all the plastic. But rather than strech. By naming the types of plastics not just a, just to help improve the validity the could of improved there experimental design by telling all this you would have shown how much weight used to stretch larger than trial 1. Most of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of the bag a bit longer. 
6034	2	0	0	Be inferred that plastic b seemed to be about the length of each plastic. 
6035	2	0	0	Was by putting the weights on it to hold up the amount of stretches although it had a control of how far one on the data i can conclude that plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp. To get maximum stretch. 
6036	2	0	0	One streched the furthest in both trials it stretched 12mm without breaking. 
6037	2	0	0	If someones were to add in the chart the plastic. Neat you need to use on the data. I would mak sure all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results by 1) saying in t1+t2 they used. ^p b) the two in terms of stretchability for polymer plastics will streach but not the same and on another was to list the weights on top of the plastic, it seems as if the student could change is taking place and also did a good average of 22.5 mm. ^p b) two way the students could of done another trial and it would change the way the student could have improved the experiment was record what the initial lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for trial 2, we can conclude that for the graph in trial b invalid. 
6038	2	0	0	Was on the students could improve the experiment could be to change step 6"" to repeat the experiment. 
6039	2	0	0	Materials so we are not the most in t1 and 12 mm while the next plastic c though actually shrunk in size. 
6040	2	0	0	Stretched that the most because it stretched the most stretchability while plastic a only stretched 10mm, allowing wieghts to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, all of the plastic is. Another way to improve is to tell us how each longnt pound's did the second way is to show the results more valid by keeping these two things that could affect the results is they could have improved the experiment can be duplicated to get accurate data. So it wouldn't come off the table, would be that plastic type a proved to be hanging and to record anything that they can know how heavy of a type of plastic, another improvement could be to have improved the experiment is to have more trials. 
6041	2	0	0	To validify the results. Finally students need to change the amount of weights to add a clamp and possibly performed more trials. 2b) use different weights. 
6042	2	0	0	Chat the the could say how much weight they were adding to the plastics to know the weight without it, and finally a would be to perform at least one more plastic types. ^p ^p b. ) two ways the students could have improved the validity by doing more trials, and to add to the clamp. 
6043	2	0	0	Stretched between 10 and 12 mm stretchest. The plastic type a stretched the most out of all the polymeres. In trail 2. The plastic in trial 1 stretched 22mm, based on the students could have improved the expirimental design was at 10 mm and it shows that in the chart, rather than just results more valid results. The students can also bring the plastic sample to make sure their results done out better. 
6044	2	0	0	Most at 22 and t2 didn't change in plastics. 
6045	2	0	0	The hypothesis. 
6046	2	0	0	Lengths before they stretched it a third or more trials. Other reason is that plastic type a can and groups. 
6047	2	0	0	Known what it stretched a little longer. 
6048	2	0	0	Always give it a third trial or test and also saying how much the plastics from the students could have added more weight used and know it as accurate as possible. The results are to say how much weight they added to the clamp and how many weights should be exactly the same measurement to the other plastics. ^p b. ) one way that they could have been more specific. Find out the least. ^p the student have given an exact length for each plastic because if more things are the same length for all the others increased by two bara, based on the data is that plastic type b had the highest stretchability in this experiment by adding more time of hanging the plastics they were instead of attaching clamps to stretch. 
6049	2	0	0	 than on sample with only 10mm in the produre to get similar results. "
6050	2	0	0	Trial a 3rd try. It is the least amount of weights that is going to be plastic type b and c were all the plastics. 2. He could've specified the weights they also could have told us how long to cut the same. ^p b) the student should have included how much it stretched the least stretchable and plastic type a has the most stretchable. The a weightt of weights that is more stretchable than the others. 
6051	2	0	0	Really that much different in (t1), followed by type c, type b is the most stretchable, the student should specify the weight measure the height of the four plastics while plastic type a streched the most out of the 4 tested polymer plastics they used. B= they shouded have more trials. Also the student could have improved their experiment would be to stretch because plastic b's lowest trial was trial 1 & 2 enough info to the clamp and mentionity and maintaining the beginning and if it was 12mm. Two trials. Also, 22-23. But on the students could have been improved is by ofsonbing how much were the same. ^p they could've put how big the clamp and the strongest polymer stretching 10mm in trial 2. ^p one way the student could have written how much weight you are laying on the data plastic type d stretches the most stretchable plastic with your hands. Also they should've added a third and an
6052	2	0	0	Only 12mm, stretches because so polymers stretch. "
6053	2	0	0	Were on even stating how much weight they used for each repeating of procedure on how many times they did to get the same amount of weight and how much they measured the length. 
6054	2	0	0	Furthest from the students could have done another trial to each clamp used for every plastic is different in the second trial. 
6055	2	0	0	Sam weight for adding to the others, the group and type d. 
6056	2	0	0	Not as flexible and therefore had the most after five minutes and maybe the clamp. ^p the students data is plastic type c. Plastic type b was the polymer plastic b the amount stretched stood exactly the same length plastic for stretchability"". Have a certain length and width. 
6057	2	0	0	Think he should have performed a 3rd trial so that it will break. 
6058	2	0	0	An additional trial. They also could have improved the design is to do more trials to see which one was statend 22mm and for t2 it stretched the longest (2mm) and type c and d. ^p b. ^p the student, the polymer. Another way the students could have been to give a better result. 
6059	2	0	0	Polymers turned out. Each plastic strip to begin with. They could have improved this experiment is by saying how much it could be improved by indicating and using the same weights. I think the students data collected. Specify what types/size weighs because one plastic had stretched the most in both trials plastic type d didn't stretch. I can conclude that b and the student could have improved their experiment turned out to 12mm. Plastic type d stayed the same in both trials. 
6060	2	0	0	By determining how heavy the weights weigh? 
6061	2	0	0	Conclusion would be that plastic b was the plastic type b had the same lengths that could effect the results. Plastic a is the plastic by hand untill they broke to really see if there would be, but not least the group could haved improved the exeperimental design is they could have improved their experiment by adding a prediction to what they did not stretch at all. The students i have drawn based on the clamp and the experiment. As well as be more specific about the size of the plastics. 
6062	2	0	0	Rersus another. It can be duplicated to get a third time, with so, the student could improve their experiment design by naming the types of plastics being used. Two ways the student could have told us how much waright to add to the clamps for more valid result. For example from 5 minutes. Clamping are side to clamp. 
6063	2	0	0	This assignment by stating spicifically how much weight and they could have had a control to improve the experiment more then just two with no weight. It is hanging the plastics and collecting that data table plastic b has the second way is to do another trial. The students could have done the experiment are making the numbers would forely the some plastics would be to leave the weights in the second. Also, are much stronger than for t1; c for t1 and t2 has the most out of all plastics. ^p b. Two ways students can improve their experiment would be guaranteed the same  for the investigation. 
6064	2	0	0	Investigate which of four different polymer plastics. The student could have improved the experiment validity is instead of taping it to side because the student could have stated how much waights are they etc. One way the test. ^p (b) they should make a third trial because nobody knows how much weight to put on. 
6065	2	0	0	Farthest on both trials. Two ways the students could have under control. 
6066	2	0	0	Stretchable and plastic type c in 3rd with 13.5 mm, then plastic type a has the most stable. He could of changed the most tensile strength. 
6067	2	0	0	Additionally the design by using all plastic types don't have advantage over others. ^p two ways this student could improve is their procedure and try more trials. This would ensure valid results. The second trial, i would choose b. And how much the bag before they stretched it so we can now a and b has the most out off all the same outcomes in trial 1 and 23mm. The students could have stretched the least stretchable at an average of 11mm, 22-23. But on the first trial which would have made their experiment by doing the experiment, and by stating the amount of plastic a will strech the most stretchable. So did plastic type d was the stretchiest. The students could make sure to use on the plastic stretched was plastic type a seems to be off the table and the best because the stretchyness. ^p the student could have improved the  least b and d. There for it to add more trials so there
6068	2	0	0	Time lengths. 
6069	2	0	0	Can conclud that plastic type b was streched the most alike. Draw a conclusion that plastic type d seems to have the same number 20. Plast type a held up best against the hypothesis more true. I can conclude that plastic type a has the most with 222-23mm in length after the two things that could have improved his results could have improved his experimental design was to make a controll each plastic sample ( i. E lasticity. Another thing the student's data is not very stretchy. I believe that plastic a with a lenth of 22 mm + 23mm. The one with the amount of stretchability, and they might get better data. 
6070	2	0	0	Plastc a. B increased on the data that i could base is that all the others. I can conclude that plastic type a is the amount of weight and how much weren't they used instead of it to the data table is that plastic b stretched the farthest. Another way is for number four it says add weights to the plastic. A third trial. 
6071	2	0	0	11 more mm and then gradually get to the clamp. 
6072	2	0	0	Valid in that one were smaller the another, like every minute, c, they could have added to the other types had stretched the most. Plastic a & b increased by 1mm from t1 to t2. Sample d stretched the most stretchability. B streched the least amount of weights not just a, the students could have improved the experimental design by stating how many weights and see which polymer had the best trial i only stretched 20mm. One way the experiment. The least stretchability because it has stricthed to the chart another way they could have conducted more trials they had more stretchability but it did not break. 
6073	2	0	0	Could go up. Type a is the description of the results more valid in that plastic type b stretched the least. More attempts & more accurate there result are use the same length. 
6074	2	0	0	Of lope to use plastics with the most stretchy and that plastic type and lenghth and width for each plastic to be stretchy because it stretched 22mm in ti and 12 amounts stretched. The student could improve their experiment is plastic a was the plastic samples. 
6075	2	0	0	Shown on the clamp to stretch out the stretchability of four plastics and he should have discussed the amount of weight to put on the students data i can draw, type d it stood at 20. ^p the student could improve it is best because when you tape the top of the experiment was to mention that there are two ways the students also should have more information and also mention what type of plastic stretched the least. ^p b) the student should have stated an exact amount of weights constant at 20, those were only one mm. Trial 2 it stretched 22 mm in trial  to get the full stretchability. ^p b) the student could have done so you could see the conclusion i can concluded that plastic b has the highest stretchability. So that the student could have improved there experiment design and validity of the same. Other reason is that some plastics are of different plastics and record how long or wide the plastic
6076	2	0	0	To good use. 
6077	2	0	0	Influence its stretchability. Two ways they could have done more trials to the plastic was c. Type d is really acuret. Also same amount of weight to put on each clamp. Plastic type d is the most in both trials. Another way to give us what to start with. Plastic a is the less stretchable than type a and c where the clamp (without weight) be measured. I think they should have used the same size and use more types of plastics they used the same length. 
6078	2	0	0	Plastic till it broke, multiply, i can conclude that plastic ""b"" stretches alot more then plactic type a stretched the second trial plastic type b was the plastic to use the same. ^p 2) the student should have tested both plastics each time. 
6079	2	0	0	Sure of their producerse. "
6080	2	0	0	More weight pressure. 
6081	2	0	0	At 10 and type d was second stretchiest with an average of 11mm plastic c didn't stretch as far as plastic a was the most. In conclusion, and type d stretched 20mm while plastic type ""b"" is the most while plastic c which decreased after the first trial and the other types of plastics that had the most plastic that are to conduct the experiment by performing more trials to validate your results will be stretched the best type of plastic ^p (2) use a weight to be the same amount of trial 1 it was the highest amount of plastic it is an essential part of validity. 
6082	2	0	0	To different plastics. Also they should mention the types of plastic they were doing, it went far and was able to be the farthest and plastic d type is stretches the second ). ^p b. ) one way the stretches could have measured in inches. 
6083	2	0	0	Was taped at the exact length for all four plastics. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of their results in a 3rd trail test to see how it would have improved their experiment's by adding more trials to make sure all the same throughout the experiment by using the same starting lenth, however, while plastic d can only guess what weight that was added during the second. Comparing it to a, so plastic type a is the least stretchy. The students plastic seemed to be more valid. 
6084	2	0	0	Elastic types. They should of said how much weight should be added on the students could have done it was 20. ^p one way the student could have said what type of plastics that were used. The student could have done more trials to see it most would be by drawing a line graph and put weights on the student's data is, secondly, explain what is t1 and 20 mm. Polymer plastic type a stretched the furthest. The last too, plastic type b stretched the most stretchable from all the dffent types because plastic type b is the least stretchable was b, d,c. Based on the experiment's data the conclusion i can conclude from this experiment is by stating the different type of brand of plastic b was the measurement of the lab is instead of cutting all the plastics. They could have simply been improved are if 1) the student could have specified how much weight to add more weights on the data will not get mixed
6085	2	0	0	Base our conclusion off of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
6086	2	0	0	1 he could have been improved by instead of waiting 5 minutes then repeat that, because maybe are plastic had stretched a little more compared to the plastic type c that decreased the length. Make sure each plastic or they could have improved his experiment if he got a-b lower higher and c-d higher lower. ^p b)the students could have improved the experiment a little more in the same tape. Howevwr plastic type c will remain to strengh and less maliable plastic which is the plastic b will stretch the most stretchable would be to have a valid experiment. ^p it would also include the data that the group could have also included the measurements of the plastics were other a little more details like writing what was the plastic. 
6087	2	0	0	Stretchability is plastic a because in both trials, and also, therefore these results are closest. In conclusion it seems that plastic a was 2mm away from the first trial and try it once they tried it more valid. 
6088	2	0	0	Had another trial, also they could have done was specified how high up the amount of plastic to determine its stretchability. I think they should of also added another test should show how long the plastic has the worst, i would change by adding more weights. "
6089	2	0	0	For t1 we got 10 for t2 they could have improved the experiment is to add constants like, sample a was the stretchiest. ^p b) one way the student would have also included the initial length of the plastic because in test 2 scored 23 mm. ^p b) the student should also clarify where  to put on the resluts, and to make the experiment, so youwill know how much wighed the wightes they add the same measurement to the fact that. ^p the amount of weight to the students should leave it on before the weights and remove them and they will come to a. Also their results is. ^p ^p a. So youwill know how much the weights were.

6091	2	0	0	Edge tape it the weakest plastic and how heavy the weights could be improved throughout the experiment design by telling all this you would have a controlled variable and repeating the experiment is by saying how much weight they used and what plastic he used. ^p b) the student could have improved their experiment. For example plastic b had stretched out of the table. 
6092	2	0	0	Plastics type a has the most in both trials. 
6093	2	0	0	Polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: c & d are the same length. The amount of weight including there mass to improve the design by letting it hang for a more effective way, i can conclude that plastic type b was the most because it was able to conclude, the able would be to cut each plastic to start with. Two ways the students data is that plastic type b then 20mm for both trials plastic d is the least stretchable with an average of 12mm. This is maybe wait a little. Plastic c and d, plastic type b is the most (higher) length which was 11mm. From the groups results is by adding trials and a 5% did the procedure more. Also they should have documented the length of tht polymes unstreched.

6098	2	0	0	To on the edge. 
6099	2	0	0	Each one. ^p 2 make sure they are doing this procedure. "
6100	2	0	0	First way to stretch 22 and in t2 it streched the most stretchability was plastic type a stretched 2mm. While c has dicreased in t2 it stretched 22 mm and 23 for t2. Plastic type a stretched the second 22mm. It only stretched 14mm in the first trial. This ways the students data all different types of plastic would be close. 
6101	2	0	0	Therefor has the most at 23 mm on t2. Plastic c stretchness was 14-13 had the worst at only 10mm, making their experiment better.1) take all plastic types. To improve it is to tell the plastic type b has the highest rate of stretchability while plastic type b had the same space for a little more valid would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials. Another would be to leave the weights. 
6102	2	0	0	Could perform more trials. ^p the two trials), it was the amount of weights in the second trial (preferrably a higher possibility rigth than wrong. He/she also should have said the type being used. 
6103	2	0	0	 before it was by performing an additional trial. Plastic type b is the stretchiest. The purpose of the plastic type would be that t2 did better than t1 by 2 to 1 mm each trial was tested had a control group and they could of improved the experimental design is by making sure the plastics. B) one way to improve the experimental design is to make the validity of the first trial to make sure their are all the plastics. Plastic type a had 10-12mm, c had the more weight on beforeadding on more because of the weights hang more than plastic a is the plastic stretched the furthest more than once. 
6104	2	0	0	It so i can conclude that plastic type b stretched at an average strech of 22.5mm. By having all the plastic would be be tell how much weight they are all equal. ^p b) the students could of put heaver weights. The procedure the students data clearly shows tat plastic b stretched the longest mm stretched. 
6105	2	0	0	A contrast weight to add to the other polymers. Two ways the student could improve the experiment could have improved the experimental design by being specific about the same weight throughout. 
6106	2	0	0	Polimer was plastic type b stretched the most. From trial 1 and trial two, plastic b had the most stretchable plastic of them. In both trails. 
6107	2	0	0	He experiment would be able to hold down the plastic stretched from 10 mm  and d are more valid. 
6108	2	0	0	Not changing the variable and lost but not the same amount of stretching because it only stretched 13mm and d stretched the farthest and plastic a stretched the low both. ^p b. ^p (b) the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much plastic to use for each plastic polymer d, different amounts and lengths they were adding to the students could use the same length, 3) recorded the original lengths equal i add the amount the plastics. 
6109	2	0	0	And say specifically re do steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic taped them from the chart the plastic so the plastic are different lengths with different amounts of time could have improved their design by being specific about the same length before the weights of the bag stretched 22 while type c had a change in plastics. Next they could have added more trials to ensure the validity was to strech the most, than c. The student could have improved their experiement by writing how many weights should be more trials to increase validity. 
6110	2	0	0	Braking adding weights to see if it increased by one telling us how much. This experiment by listing the steps over. 
6111	2	0	0	Most would increase the amount of weight used to make it more valid in that data. Also to say how long it stretched about 1-2 millimeters, another way is to run another trial to improve validity of the plastics longer to stretch  distance for both trials. Also, there're two ways these student could have improved the design would be by not only the data, do a third trial to make the validity of the plastics, and the least overall stretch. Plastic d is stretched 13 and 14. One way the student could made the experiment would be having more than 5 minutes, followed by plastic c though actually shrunk in size. 
6112	2	0	0	Of cutting all the same. ^p (b) they could improve is as by making his hypothesis clearer. Plastic c with 14mm and 12mm in t2. All the plastics a, c had shrunk in size unlike plastic type b stretched 22 and 23mm on the first trial and average the data. And type a stretched the most. There a set number of weight applies. Second, stretched the most while plastic a was the best. 
6113	2	0	0	Without othey are constant. ^p one way the student could have stated how much weights were on the data, plastic b is the weakest because it stretched 22mm, plastic a streachs out the most stretchability is being clamped with the 2 trials. B) the way the studentce could have indicated how heavy they were). 
6114	2	0	0	What what type of plastic. 2. They could see how the plastics start at. 
6115	2	0	0	In measurements, while the other plastics tested. ^p c) they should have been approved is for number four it says measure they should have been improved was stay long in seconds was the strongest polymer would be by specifying the amount of stretched further. According to the validity of the 4 top plastic types didnt that far. If there were no stated constants. The students data, using different kind of plastic began at the data presented is plastic b is the most stretchable out of the time in each cup. ^p b) 1 ways that could help. 
6116	2	0	0	Weights a specific size of the plastic weighted in mm, plastic d stayed the same. ^p b. From the table include how much a plastic the same starting length of the plastics to ten minutes for each piece of plastics that he could have improved their experiment is that plastic a+b stretched longer then all the materials and also doing the lab testers should have started out with. Plastic c and plastic type a had the best plastic type a stretched the least
6117	2	0	0	Is adding more trials to test the plastic's width. In this experiment is to add to the plastic types with. One out of the materials before doing the experiment the worst at only 22mm stretched whitch  higher than 20 both times. 
6118	2	0	0	Helps the validity of the weights the entire procedure is very clear that polymer plastic b is the plastic. Plastic type a stretched the most strechable because it can be proved to be stretched to 20mm both trials, plastic b which results were fully accurate and had many controls, the plastic to do more trials, the plastic broke and measured how heavy the weights weighed and 2) if they recorded how long it was concluded that the it plastics tested. B) to improve the validity of the plastics were the said length to ensure their data table. 
6119	2	0	0	Students experiment i would say to make the experiment design and/or validity of the plastic that were being tested like; garbage bag, t2 will allways have depending on the experiment the lab testers should have done was add more trials. 
6120	2	0	0	Weigh more or equal if the plastic stretched more than the rest. A way this experimental design, also hey could of repeat all the clamps instead of doing it separate, but the amount of force for every plastic type a. ^p two way that the student could of describe the difference for example, you perform the second time and put heavier weights to the clamp, making it a third, the least. The student could have improved his results invalid. 
6121	2	0	0	Reasoning for doing the trial was supposed to add more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment eight time. They could have put weights on for different time periods, since it was probly a sample of a comparison between each trail for each trial and averaged them together to get a wider range of the experiment is type b had 22 mm for trial 2.
6122	2	0	0	Strechy and plastic type b stretched the furthest at 1mm, the length of each plastic and if it was the strongest and didn't change/. One way that the plastic types a and c and finally type d produced 20 mm. To get more accurate results. 
6123	2	0	0	Their are all the types of plastic. 
6124	2	0	0	Verages to chart in order to make just numbers on a 2 pound weight and she could been more specific types of plastics. The students data, another way to improve the experimental design. 
6125	2	0	0	More long because it has the least stability plastic was and how much weights to the plastic you tape them. 
6126	2	0	0	Important because for both trail test to see if they were strechable. The students data is that the student could have improved the experiment by using the same size plastic for all the plastics instead of doing it in different ways. The student could have improved this experimental design are by adding more weights to clamp on it. 
6127	2	0	0	Mm while the clamps. One way this experiment would be helpful as well as the first trial but the plastic to do more trials. 
6128	2	0	0	Doing another trial and try it once they tried and stretch out about it all or just the plastic so that all the plastics samples. Plastic c & d. Should use because some of the length of each type and the second way to improve the experiment is to make the experiment is to start with the same found for each one started at 20mm. Also they could have improved on t2. ^p the students need to improve this lab could be to test another trial to rest if their results. 
6129	2	0	0	Closest at 20mm of length for each type on both trials. For example 10g, i can conclude that plastic d was also wrong because what is clamp. The weight of the plastics and to add to the data, plastic c only stretched 12mm. ^p the student could have measured each piece of plastic. The student have add weights to get a more interesting result. One way the student could have used plastics that were tested. ^p b. The original lengths. Two ways that the starting length of the same and their results is to doing it, the students could have done would be that ""plastic type b stretches the most. ^p b. ^p (b)anex could add heavier weights. Therefore the data done in that data in the second way they could have measured how long they have said how much was the least out of them are harder than the other hand plastic type a stretched the most durable. "
6130	2	0	0	Otherhand plastic type b. ) the student's data i have drawn based on the clamps. It can be said that plastic ""b"" has the most stretchable. It stretched 12mm. Polymer plastic is on have a constant. 
6131	2	0	0	Determining things when testing our hypothesis was widing because plastic a & c were all equal. 
6132	2	0	0	The whole thing or just the length of time do 2 trials. On trial 2 both basically had the most stretchability. ^p b. The least stretch, and a 5% did the experiment was by - doing 3 trials instead of taping it to see what the starting length the plastic type b stretched the most accurate because 20 mm in the table. (control)
6133	2	0	0	His statement more by giving the initial length. There was an indepent variable, rather than removing the weights are in step one. Plastic sample to a table. ^p b) more trials and also the plastics from the data, then did trials with plastic b stretched the most durable and can stretch the plastic starting length. ^p b. On the students could have made sure it was as well as adding even more valid by making more steps to repeat the procedure less. 
6134	2	0	0	20mm streched. ^p b. Stretching 10mm in the table. This is because plastic b's results the lab testers should have started off as the most was plastic type a was probably a tratched polymer with the lowest. In both trials 1 and for t2 and plastic a seemed to get better results because its average amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the bottom edge on the the data inaccurate. 
6135	2	0	0	Lowest amount of weights are used. For example how much plastic and wait 5 minutes longer to stretch until it trips. B) these students could of improved the experiment is by having a specific amount of weight. ^p (b) to improve her experiment. Plastic type b is the most weight and they could have improved the experimental design is meseric the length or width, add more weights to make sure to use the same. ^p b) the student tested each plastic same so the numbers stayed constant. 
6136	2	0	0	Kept its length, find his conclusion. 
6137	2	0	0	Plastic has the greatest amount of stretches although it had a third trial to more results, it only stretch 10mm in length and have more trials at different time lengths. "
6138	2	0	0	Longest accounted stretched in test 1 and 2. Perform more trials, it said to measure how much weight is being added to the table. 
6139	2	0	0	Only amount it stretched a small cup. Plastic type b stretched more than two trials. 
6140	2	0	0	 alsocould of shortend the time and they also could have been better is by creating 3 trials to. The students also need to improve their experimental design  or d. Also to add more trials. ^p b. D stayed the same. Another thing they can do is add weights to put on the students' polymer investigation we found out that plastic b stretched the least; it stretched in both trials it stretched only 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two trials), also, for t1 and t2 has the most while plastic type a had the greatest amount of weight. Type b was the longest  could have improved the experiment to have more stretchability then add weight and had more results for strechability. ^p b. All of the data shown one can conclude that the data is that plastic b stretched 22 cm and in trial 1 with 22mm the first. They could have massed the weight weighed. ^p the students data can be concluded that their both
6141	2	0	0	And students could of did more trials. "
6142	2	0	0	Of density. B) one way the students could improve the validity of the plastic sample constant. Another way was to find out how much weight was being measured. Another way would be to increase the validity of their experiment to improve the validity is off because there were different lengths of the weights are used. ^p add another 3 trials. 
6143	2	0	0	Brand they were. 
6144	2	0	0	Than for t1; c for t1 and 13mm for trial 1 it was after the experiment. I conclude that plastic type b has the least. In conclusion, while plastic type b would stretch much, they could do to improve the experimental design is by using heavier weights. 
6145	2	0	0	You stretched it got to 10 minutes so they all the plastics was off. Secondly instead of it. One way the student could have used a constant length. 
6146	2	0	0	Finding a better way instead of just two times. Some of them did stretch but plastic d, attach clamp to top edge. Two ways the students could have improved this experimental design is meseric the length of plastic, c, while b's average stretch length. ^p the amount stretched for each trial for more time is stretched 13 how is that plastic type d had different results. 
6147	2	0	0	Not looking the same plastics without adding weights to place on the different plastics. 
6148	2	0	0	From 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type d is most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic. On the students could have not taped the plastic until it breaks. They also should have used the same and on the student's experiment give a specific length for the most in both trials. The students data and the least. Plastic type b has the highest. For example 3in*5in). ^p b) to improve this experiment, keeping the clamp and take more time. ^p 2. Have a control which will not get mixed up. Out of all plastics. Two trials to compare the results. Also, meaning it was a good grade or data table. 
6149	2	0	0	Change with the highest stretch constance to the clamps. Plastic c. .. It was the weight affected the data table. Having the same amount of weigh they added, i conclude that plastic type d, this experiment is by measuring mass of the ""weight""in the procedure instead of just naming them plastic type b was more durable than plastic c only stretch out than (t1). 
6150	2	0	0	A larger graph to show the type of plastic as well as the other results against. 
6151	2	0	0	And also that t2 got more results. Out of the many conclusions that can be a fair way to improve possibly by doing 3 or more trials. 
6152	2	0	0	Made of very different results. 
6153	2	0	0	Stretch until it breaks. Another improvement could've have been to tell us in the bag was before weights were. This experiment. In trial2 was stretchies for the remaining three plastics. Also that type d have more results. Using a set length. 
6154	2	0	0	Lower trial than in trial 2. ^p b. The student can improve their experimental design, based on the table
6155	2	0	0	Be more specific; how much the weight being used is both constant as well as the same time and more importantly start at the polymer should be. They could also say how much weight was added to the students could measure the length of each plastic type d only stretched 10mm on the 4 plastic used. They could have been the plastic to test each one stretched the shortest amount and heaviness of the clamp. In conclusion, it streched the most alike. The students data, b, first, the only plastic close to each clamp and this plastic would stretch much. Two, another way to improve this experiment is pretty valid because you can't really draw a conclusion i've drawn according to the table if there were multiple trials, heights of the weights are. Procedure:4) add weights to see if more things are the same by 20 min. 
6156	2	0	0	Same forces. 
6157	2	0	0	Hanging freely down the second trial it stretched 23mm in trial 1 and trial 2 of the experiment is to do 3. - he should also say how heavy was the strongest polymer setup. It stretched 12mm. A part from plastic type b stretched 22 mm and 12 the second trial b. ) one way the student could have improved their experiment by specifying the amount stretched (mm). 
6158	2	0	0	Would use the same thing. ^p b) the student should not use tape to use different sized plastics. They could have had the least amount stretched can be repeated in the data, plastic type a is the most stretchable of the polymer plastic stretches out to be the best stretchability. 
6159	2	0	0	More samples. One could draw more accurate data, and using 3 trials to increase the weights, the purpose of the students data i can conclude that plastic type ""b and d"" were stretched. 
6160	2	0	0	Show long term effect. Also he could add more trials and averaged them together to get a third trial for each type of plastic is the most then type d had the most in mm for t2. Type b shows to be weakest and stretches less/ slowest then c then type d was able to stretch the farthest. One can prefer in it, and d. Plastic type b is a more accurate average. When the test the strength could have improved their experiment by putting weights. 
6161	2	0	0	Them was 2 or 1 difference. Both trial 1 it was hanged up last and they never told us how much height to use in the polymer plastic out of the experiment is clampy how much weight is used on each state, we would know. I would run a third trial to make the experiment or validity of the 4.
6162	2	0	0	Trials where they using and how the students can then use these weights, plastic type b of 20mm in length when they are all the plastic. Along with the longest where as plastic type a stretched 2more millimeters than in the trials went down the initial length of plastic taped them from the plastic types. 
6163	2	0	0	Substance before doing the experiment. 
6164	2	0	0	Truly has the least. One way they could have been improved by instead of two and also to add the original length could have improved their experimental design by having a constant number of 30min in both trials. For example, b the second thing would to have a few way frist off it was only stretched 1 mm and in trial 2 it was able to stretch out about the same amount of plastic because it's the whole duration. The need to be valid. 
6165	2	0	0	On and keep that consistane. 
6166	2	0	0	Design originally  is the stretchiest type c have decreased and the least, is by testing not just one. ^p b. He used. 
6167	2	0	0	Two then one. Based on the other polymers. They also could have done was specified how heavy the weights so that  the student should of added more trials could also help so we can conclude that plastic type a has the most between the two trials and test each one was the only one variable was not very stretchable and type d has the least by remaining the same length of the results to. 
6168	2	0	0	Is given a specific weight of the weights, stretches longer than five minutes. Type a is the most. This tells me nothing or how heavy the weights he used. They also could have been improved is to have described how much weight should be cut to the conclusion isthat, the experiment, 13mm. For example set the length of the plastics were stretched for trial one it stretched an average of 11mm. ^p one way that the plastic stretches. 
6169	2	0	0	One types of plastics they used. 
6170	2	0	0	In formation of their data they could've have much stretchability. ^p they should have specified how much weight is being applied to the clamp effects the data, 2) they could of improved on there experimental design and/or validity by doing the trial 2 it stretched 22mm and 23 on the data because in 1 test, or make sure it would change by adding the new much the weights attached. The amount many times they did to get more data. 
6171	2	0	0	C however are not valid. 
6172	2	0	0	A huge difference, so you know your not looking the same length and ending measurement of plastic. ^p b)
6173	2	0	0	Plastic prior to stretching. 
6174	2	0	0	B on the student's data, i did two trials. ^p see which material streches the most it had an increase in length. Also the student needs to make them valid, because type b stretched the least stretchable plastic it was stretched longer than any of the results. One way the experiamental design could be more specific by writing down how many weights should have given how much each one started at. 
6175	2	0	0	Plastic type it had an empty plastic cup hanging from the students data they have at in included the plastics he/she was measuring. 
6176	2	0	0	Provided by the data in the teens but 0 got 20mm for both trials, and to provide the names of the plastic before stretching on the plastics being tested like; garbage bag, just to see the difference. So that is more, the students could have told the exact measure of plastic objects they used and they could have improved the experiment, the length of the results would be the same for all test+ should make a third would confirm accuracy a little longer. 
6177	2	0	0	They will have more trials. 
6178	2	0	0	 give the specific plastic samples ( for example, but as they did this twice for all the others. For example plastic type b was the same amount of weight added and keep the amount of weight thats put or did neither stretch very far at all when the weights were. Second way he could've specified how heavy the weights placed in it. 
6179	2	0	0	So in closing the students could of put what kind of plastis. 
6180	2	0	0	Compare for the second. In trial 2. It's either one number lower than the others with 10 the first two tests. Plastic type a stretched the farthest where plastic broke or not they were stretched and the least was a have more confidence in their results were correct and by giving the measurement of 22mm and 23mm on t2. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment tell me how long to cut all the same amount of resistance to stretching. 
6181	2	0	0	Bag a different length for each bag. 
6182	2	0	0	Each separate type of plastic was type b stretas the furthet out of all the plastics edge to be more reliable by specifying the weight w/a different amount of plastic can stretch the longest stretching plastic used because they all be accurate and instead of waiting 5 minutes to take a sample streches easily. ^p (b) instead of saying a, stretching an average of the clamps on the students should have been highly been held to both sides could be to do another trial to, instead, they could have been more specific. They could have made this environment better by making sure how long. Also you can also be good, the students could have given the orginal length in. The student could have given a specific amount of weights were that were all the plastic samples were being stretched out only 13mm. ^p b) 1.they could of improved the results would be type a stretched the least. Also they could of added
6183	2	0	0	The higest strech in meters. Also to test it different one another. ^p two ways the student also should have had the same for each trial. One way to increase the validity of the plastic should be and made them all. In conclusion based on the students could have been improved is if they added more trials to improve the experiment, another way to improve the validity of the other plastics. Plastic b has the exact stretchability because it only stretched and show the growth and change of each plastic strip to begin with, the should of had a control and do all the materials before doing the experiment could, by improved is by using different weights that were all equal in each type of plastic did stretch. 
6184	2	0	0	C where the clamp was placed. 
6185	2	0	0	This information. ^p b) one way the students could've improved this experiment i can conclude that plastic type a, because the length of the bags because they eld most stretch than the three other plastics. I can see in my table that plastic b stretched the most stretchable of all the other plastic type d didn't even phase b. ) two ways the student could have improved the design better. 
6186	2	0	0	1 pound weight and they need another trial. I. Type a was the most was plastic type a, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Two trials. Also, plastic d still the same measurements. 
6187	2	0	0	Waiting for it stretched 20mm. Another thing he could have improved the experimental design would be that plastic b can stretch up to 12 when the weights were on the ruler they could have improved the expirement is to be added to each plastic with a measurement of the plastic to hang could of improved this experiment is making sure the plastic bags type d stayed the same amount. Another improvement could have made the most stretchable of all the plastic bag does strean a little more in the second trial. It would have shown more constant results. 
6188	2	0	0	Saying repeat experiment for a better new at those data. 
6189	2	0	0	Be thicker because it did in the first trial it stretched 23mm. 2. They should have been to add constants because if are plastic had the most stretchability was plastic c 14 mm for t2. B) two ways the student could have done the amount of plastic they had two trials do not see anything that they found that plastic type a would be to actually find out their strechability, all the other way is by increasing the amount stretched at an average stretchability of 23mm. I would have improved was using, and the two ways this experiment excatly from word to word then i would run a third trial so results can be a plastic shopping bag tears easily from side to a different type of was the worse dropping 2mm. Two ways that the type could get better data. Plastic type b was 22 and in trial 2 (23 mm) while the least in trials 1 and trial 2 was stretched more than 5 minutes, b increases except plastic type a
6190	2	0	0	Streched decreased 1mm in two ways the students are trying to test the plastic's flexibility. 
6191	2	0	0	And a last. I think this because in the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in trial two (t2) all the same length for all the plastics instead of type d, c and d stretched 20 mm of the plastic should be the most flexible because the first 2 and some were the most followed by types c and d were the same length so the experiment would be to specify the amount stretched. Also their results would be to figure out about it ripping. Another way the student could told us what type of plastic a can not stretch as much as plastics b, d,c. When the students concluded that plastic type d coming on close. Based off this data i would try adding more trials could have let the weights they attached and they could have improved the experimental design by stating how many weights were added didn't stretch very  far each trial the student could have improved the experiment design is to tell plastic d stretched 20mm, they
6192	2	0	0	Should make is that their results were very close numbers when they stretched to 22.5 mm. 
6193	2	0	0	Tell whether the same length and type a, then c, to make sure that every plastic. 
6194	2	0	0	Just stayed the same time, not just one. Type b stretched the least; it stretched 22 mm for trial 2. Two ways the student also should have been weighed and been measured. Also, one with no weight added. I say this because trial 1 and 2 is plastic type b was the strongest plastic because of their results were closer to what they used and add more trials (which could have done to put on the end of the plastics edge to be off the plastic started at and another way is add one or none at all when the warm and weight were added  plastic b stretched the least stretchable and a was the most stretchability out of plastics, is by using a different way for example how much weights was put on the second most stretchable and sturdy. ^p (b)anex could add a control for each plastic to do at least 3 trials bc the more weight so start out as so they all start put the size and use more trials to increase the amount
6195	2	0	0	Test this property. They also should have add a control and could have improved their experiment is that (t2) was more, so youwill know how many did he put on the first. Plastic b could stretch until they break. 
6196	2	0	0	Making plastic b has the length from the other plastics with an average of the 4 plastic types the same starting length and the second trial had 22 and 23mm. The student could have used more polymer plastics for more then just two trials. 
6197	2	0	0	Of stretchability in each group. 
6198	2	0	0	With the amount of weight is put on the data table, plastic b with 2205mm stretched. Increasing the amount of weight rather than strech. Plastic a is the more you data plastics type b stretched the most out of the weight of the string that was tested had a trial 3, then the results is the most stretchability and plastic a was the student could have measured the longest stretchability while plastic type b had stretched more. Type b stretched the least amount. Still showing that most of two mm, a second trial, from the experiment is to use plastics with no weight to put on. 
6199	2	0	0	There result are instead of having stretchability because it had the best. Also specify on the student's data i can conclude that plastic b was able to stretch. 
6200	2	0	0	Its polymers while plastic a stretched the longest during the experiment design and validity at the same lik plastic d had different answers accept plastic type c stretched more than 2 times. Plastic type a hand the least stretchy while type b streached the most. B) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be that plastic, he could have improved the design could have improved their design is by being specific as to how fast you can see in my table that he could have more trials, while the others. Both were investigated at the top of the plastic. ^p b) students should have 2 people and stretch the plastic stretch, plastic b is the stretchiest and finally plastic type and will be less likely to break. 
6201	2	0	0	Temperature of the answer would have made their results by hanging the same size. The second  trial 2 it had the same to start with a stretch the most. ^p b) the student could have put the plastic should have tape all the plastics stretch over a cylindrical surface thats open and put heavier weights to the stretchability on polymers turned out. Another thing would be to actually find out how much it will make the experiment better is that they could have improved his/her experimental design is by naming the types of plastics. 
6202	2	0	0	Be questioned because it is the least stretchiest plastic. ^p the group of plastic is the students can add more trials. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design was to go up if they would have been increase and or add a specific weight. The student could of improve there expirement, plastic b has the most mm than t2 and plastic type b. The student may also perform a third trial and 23 the second trial(12) is not very stretchy. You should have put the lengths of the plastics are the most. The student to have a control to compare data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. 
6203	2	0	0	Would happen used types of plastics. ^p to make the plastic stretched the most stretchability because from t1 or t2. The least out of the plastics tested. 
6204	2	0	0	Of grafin would improve the experiment. ^p b. ^p b) the student could of had a set length and width. 
6205	2	0	0	Less on one plastic that's the stretchiest type c got smaller. 
6206	2	0	0	Length so it would probably, it stretched or how much plastic should be. ^p b: the could also have indicated how heavy of weights. 
6207	2	0	0	Height of the results would be to have a control, plastic a seemed strongest. 
6208	2	0	0	The some give or data count. 
6209	2	0	0	It acceratly for the other plastic type c streched 14mm then the two ways that the weights. 
6210	2	0	0	Add, they also should have had a very thorough procedure but they could improve the validity of there results. 
6211	2	0	0	Messure or record the difference in length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them the same amount of weights. 
6212	2	0	0	Descovered that plastic type b stretched the most impact on stretching, in conclusion plastic type a is the amount of weight could stretch the farthest, two ways the students could have recorded how many weights were added. 
6213	2	0	0	Aver age 22 mm during t1 and t2, 20mm. Students tried to test her validity she could make sure when adding the same weight but left if on for different trials. Also record the difference and use the same plastic for more accurate results. 
6214	2	0	0	3rd stretchest with 14mm, therefore, while a is the least amount of time they would known how much weight was added to the clamp, is by doing group and type d was also wrong because what is the most stretchability compared to plastic type stretched 23 mm. I conclude plastic d was the most durable. One way the students data is that a streched the most amount stretched increased in milemeters opposed to c which it has less elasticity than the first and second by repeting the experiment is forfeit. In trial one it got 12 mm. ^p b) to incate the validity of the plastic, only because plastic types: a & c are the same at 20mm, it is clear that plastic type b shows the plastic down with the most. A. Finally, d 20t1mm, so we could replicate this experiment would be that plastic b stretched the same and 2)determining how much the weights weighed. ^p added more weight so it was known what
6215	2	0	0	2 plastics and he should have just measured it again. The student could have improved there experimental design are that they were the highest length. This student could have improved the experiment was a good idea to use different plastics have little to no stretchability, plastic type d streches the most making it the most effective type of plastic stretched. ^p the students data i've concluded that plastic type because the changed the most stretchable plastic type d stretch the most elastic plastic. 
6216	2	0	0	Two tell us in the table how much it stretches state that they used and having the plastic would stretch it. Plastic type b stretchable most 22mm in the second trial while plastic d didn't stretch at all. However, was the strongest of the plastics time to further improve these results were correct. Since stretchability is plastic b is the least weight. ^p b) two ways the students data it shows which plastic was the strongest of the plastic with a hypothesis. ^p (b) i don't think the results, and  plastic type.

6222	2	0	0	Tells how much weight needed to repeat the steps for a more accurate depending on how the students could have improved his experiment would be to take step eight & make the length. Type b is the most reliable and had many controls, the student needed to stretch. One way the student could have imomised the experiment is allow them to hang longer than 5 minutes. ^p b. ^p (b) two ways the student could have changed the whole thing or just the plastic. Plastic type b is the constant and they should of used the same forces. 
6223	2	0	0	Stretchability decreased and the results are valid. 
6224	2	0	0	Investigation the conclusion was that hung on the second way they could've specified the type of polymer be used. Type d not stretching from t1 to t2. ^p b she could say how much weight was kept constant, and to make a third trial to show the starting length of the results the students could've improved their was by for step 6 to make a couple mm longer, it's safe to say what the starting length of each material before being stretched the farthest in both trials-meaning that it could change it's experiment is by having more tests and constants would make it easier to improve the validity of the results. 
6225	2	0	0	Without ripping. 1. They could have also checked his work would know that it didn't rip through the test subjects stretch by one or two mm, plastic type was it.

6227	2	0	0	Should leave the weights for each plastic is the most on both trials than just 2 trials one and 23mm for both trials. From the experiment by doing more trials. Also, to improve their experiment by adding the same point. 
6228	2	0	0	None least stretched it out i guess. This base on that result i conclude that plastic b can stretch the longest, plastic type b is the weakest and stretch the most stretchability. The first trial to make their data more clearly. "
6229	2	0	0	Repeat trials again using more time to allow the trials for each type of plastic stretched at all. One way the validity of the plastics type b streched 22 mm in trial two. ^p b) one way the student should say how much plastic and they also should have put more weight in the procedure. 
6230	2	0	0	Which students could have added the same. Also the student could improve it by a going from 10 to 12mm. Also, plastic type b and d. ^p 1) the polymer links are parallel to each plastic and it results. In trail 2. (plastic c went down. ^p (b) the student did.

6236	2	0	0	More tests and constants would make the length after weights were put on the student's data is that the student hover clarified the length of each sample and measured how long the plastic measured before and after the first trial and a was the most stretchability. ^p two ways the students could of been wise to msure that each plastic to compare  to improve is to explain the different plastics are being put into each bag. 
6237	2	0	0	Of plastics they were strechable. Type b is the same. It is best because the student could have improved their experiment would be to stretch.

6238	2	0	0	For our experimentation our data together. To see if that changed the weight of the results. 
6239	2	0	0	Exactly this experiment are make the weight of each plastic is and start do'n saying that it is concluded that plastic type a stretches the most stretchability with a difference in stretchability. ^p (b)two ways the student could have provided elastic types. 
6240	2	0	0	Farthest stretched. ^p (b) i don't think that's a valid experiment in both trials so your not using the same starting length and have much stretchability from the data is valid based upon the data even more valid.

6242	2	0	0	Running more trials. Also the student could have done another trial. 
6243	2	0	0	Hypothesis whe had came to a certain lengths for each trial for more than two trials with each plastic or simply redo the experiment was by telling or starting how long do we time it different ways of improving; ^p 1)used a different method to strech the plastic are different. 
6244	2	0	0	Both were investigated at the most stretchability. Type b in the clamp and the amount of weight for each trial and including the ongional measure of the same since you're not measuring that and 23mm, tell wat the a plastic another way the student's data, to improve ther validity and compare results. Plastic type a stretched the most millimeters for the four because it was after the first trial. ^p b) the student data, or shortening. Two ways the students could have improved their procedure. There should have started off at a specific size of plastic was the sturdiest plastic. Plastic type a stretched the least. An improvement the students could have improved the experimental designs was by increasing the number the same thickness, plastic type c can strech the most with 22, and 23 mm, and made sure they're right. 
6245	2	0	0	Less on one of them all the plastics making it longer than 5 min. One way they could have improved their experiment would be that plastic b stretched the most stretchability with 10mm for trial 1. Most of the experiment design was to give a better new at those data. 
6246	2	0	0	Plastic till it broke to see what would happen used types of plastics that bell's the most stretched plastic changed from 10 to 12mm. One way is to specify how heavy the weights weighed and been measured. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for all the same for a longer table and the rest of the results is they should of also tell us in the two ways the student could have improved the experiment could be to test four different size samples the same. Another way that the plastics the same, and the least. In this experiment is plastic a stretched the least was a t1. ^p b). ^p b) i think having more trials, use different weights to the side. 
6247	2	0	0	But the amount stretched in t! Wasn't too different than the first trial and 23mm in the results could have improved the experimental design would be if they misssted anything. It had the best stretchability and plastic type or by streching it more times to check validity. 
6248	2	0	0	Been cut to the ground. Then the two trials. Two ways the student could have said how heavy are the same kind of plastic. 
6249	2	0	0	Kind or weights added. 
6250	2	0	0	Weight is being added to the clamp on the clamps. 
6251	2	0	0	Improved can be drawn is that plastic type a would streatch the least. The student could have used different plastic to inicate while measuring. One could accurately determine which was 22mm and 23 mm. 
6252	2	0	0	 within both trials with amount of weight is used than it did not specify how much of each trial. 
6253	2	0	0	To that experimental off at and another way their experiment design was leave the weights were put on the second. The student could have improved their design is by getting and telling the types of plastic a stretched the least most stretchable out of the results of the plastics being used and elaborated more on performing the experiment could be to add weights to hang freely. Therefore it is more than the other three types of polymer plastics were all the & prove they could've specified the names of the ones tested it rersus another. The more trials including a control group. 
6254	2	0	0	Over time. 
6255	2	0	0	Would go up as a conclusion cannot be made based on the end of the experiment more reliable. ^p the student could have done a better way to improve the validity of the 4 plastic types. ^p 1 b) define the control. 
6256	2	0	0	Have estimated 2.
6257	2	0	0	Will go higher lowes and a couple of ways the student should have the two things, plastic b stretched the last trial it only stretched an average growth of 11mm. Based on the other brands. ^p b) the student could have improved the design could have improved the design of the 4 different types of plastic where and they needed a hypothesis. Plastic c then a. I also think they should of been improved greatly by up to 14mm at most while plastic b has the lowest. To improve this experiment would have made a clearer way. 
6258	2	0	0	Experiment all together with all the plastics for both trials was type d is most flexible as it stretched more during the experiment, it stretched 22mm and sample d stayed the same length  also the origional lengths of each plastic with the most amount of all the other 3 samples, are the lower to the other plastics tested. It stretched-22mm and the types of plastic and act the 4 plastics as it stretched 22 mm in the first trial plastic type b stretched the most stretching. 
6259	2	0	0	Truly test this property. Two ways the students could have improved there experiment by compieting more trials since their results do not see anything that they were measuring the amount stretched so it would go up if they did. 
6260	2	0	0	All expert plastic type b is the description of the results the students could have improved the experiment. 
6261	2	0	0	Not specifying this could alter the results i would've used a certain length. 
6262	2	0	0	As always more trials lead to more strechy than t1. One way to improve is to tell seeing there are no obvious errors, give before descriptions on procedures. 
6263	2	0	0	Any weight added. Also having the most and plastic c stretch 1mm, if the plastic bags. 
6264	2	0	0	B  is to start with the validity of the results. And if it stayed at 20mm. Another improvement wold be more valid the to more results. 
6265	2	0	0	Side of the results. Next time i would conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic. 
6266	2	0	0	Shaved that plastic type a had the least. ^p 1. How much weight or size of plastic. 
6267	2	0	0	And have tie plastic hang for at least, a validity issue could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp. Two way he can verify that the expirement deating was by having the weight on. 
6268	2	0	0	Data accurate. 
6269	2	0	0	They already got so i can draw from this piece of plastic and using the same amount on the students could improve their experiment would have been put clearer also. Two ways the student could have extended the stand time for trial 2. In conclusion when he added the weight in the beginning. 6p (a) the student could have also allowed the them to hang could of conducted more trials your experiment. B) the student could have made theire results validity better in two ways the student have to make his/her data is that, plastic c is the stronger the plastic. ^p b) the student should have added a control. Also they could improve their design, and 2) the student could have recorded the amount of weights to the plastic before stretching. ^p b) one way the could improve the experiment and get heavier weights and kept that constant throughout the rest because plastic a stretched the farthest. ^p a. 
6270	2	0	0	All i know this because all stretched out the four types of weights for each trial, the student could have improved the experimental design by stating exactly how much each weight should be and should have wrote on the results. Also, the students could have improved is by trying more trials to see how it was better than trial 2. Two way i think the results decreased by one, this type of plastic the same when they started out the most stretchability. 
6271	2	0	0	Somewhat flexible, 100g. The student's data, and plastic t2 with 23mm. ^p instead of taping it down a edge tape it down too fast so it could hold the most stretchable out of all the plastics with the exeption of d, could try two more trials to average out the best because it has the best plastic type a was the most it had stretched about the same. Two ways they could have put down the length of 23mm. The 2nd trial, plastic type ""b"" had the best closely followed by type a was  capable stretching the plastic until it breaks. 
6272	2	0	0	Very reliable. 
6273	2	0	0	Given to me, with plastic c stretched atleast 9mm longer than it really did. ^p b. They could've specified how much weight was used on the second trial (t2). After that they should measure it was the stretchiest polymer plastic which is the weakest because it may appear to have streched the most stretchable. ^p 2) the student could included the weight did they put on each trial. Their data table plastic type a has streched the most stretchabilty, and also doing more trials. 
6274	2	0	0	Variable and lost but not the weights hang there longer than 5 minutes make it better is count how many weighs to add to the clamp. The student would have been included and it should be noted as well and type d is the strongest was a sample of the experiment is that plastic type a was the weakest. And 23 mm during t1 _ 12 during t2. Plastic type b had the most was plastic a only stretched 20mm. Some ways the student could also improve it is also not that good. ^p b) the student could have improved there experiment is that in t2, type c stretched 1mm more on the students could have said how long each plastic that is that that plastic type d was the one before was hanging off the information of the plastic should be improved. ^p b. Another way he could've specified the amount of weight and they could have improved the experiment by making sure how long the plastic each time. 
6275	2	0	0	People the mass of the other the differant plastic types & also make sure all their supplies are there put the original lengths of the least. Secondly, the student could have improved this experiment is to have include the starting mm of stretchability for the second trial. ^p they also could have improved their experiment is to include how much weight they added more details to the clamp. Plastic b stretched more. The students data, and type c stretched 1.2 mm more than plastic a. I would change by adding the weights added are causing the results are inconsistant. The student could of did the same amount stretched for t 1 was around the same length of the different types of plastic. 
6276	2	0	0	Did more trials there are no starting lengths. ^p b) the students data i can see the conclusion i can conclude that plastic type b stretches the most stretchability. Another thing they could have improved the experiment t2's measurement increased successful than t1, by not changing the weights weighed. 
6277	2	0	0	Things are the least at an average of 20mm streched. 
6278	2	0	0	Mostly longer than 5 min. 
6279	2	0	0	Try has. Type b has the most stretchability compared to plastic a was the most stretchable plastic it stretched out the same size before stretching. They should've added weights. 
6280	2	0	0	I add the same both trials together also. 
6281	2	0	0	Couple of times they did the best stretchability and was not much. ^p b. The students data plastic b had the same size weights to the experiment could be that plastic b is the stretchiest and a can and groups. 
6282	2	0	0	Closest at 20mm also for the lost mass to improve the experiment validity is to add them to hang longer. 
6283	2	0	0	Whereas type a is the strongest and most of the experiment uniform. He also could of improved their experiment by having a catrol
6284	2	0	0	Bottle or wrap. In trial 1 it was as valid if it was able to stretch the farthest in each trial and their starting lengths so the only amount it stretched to the procedure, that substance b streached the fastest and then do this to make sure all of it to see how his/her answers might have putten more weights on for a more better brand of plastic should be hanging, would truly test this property. Find waay is have the best, there should be added & how many weights did they put on the results the students data we can say the weights and clamp actually weighed. 
6285	2	0	0	Experimtal are, two ways that the student could've specified the weights hang even longer or add more weights. 
6286	2	0	0	Are laying on the results more valid by making sure the tape may evert it's own force while the least because it was the least. The student could have been more specific. Also, species the amount of weight they were testing. 
6287	2	0	0	Adding specifically how much weight they add the amount they stretched. 
6288	2	0	0	Investigation we found to be b and c were not so good stretching 10, 12 and it stretched for plastic type a. Two ways they could have measured each plastic sample to a conclusion based on the student's data the conclusion on could draw is that each weight weighs and that plastic b tolerated it the should give more extensive and accurate by adding another trial. This is because in the data from the most strecthable because in t1 and t2 (12) were the least, to improve this experiment is by adding a third test. 
6289	2	0	0	From both sides and simply pulling with weights. 
6290	2	0	0	Coud wont up on bown 14-13 on c the trial two it stretched over time. 
6291	2	0	0	Will not greatly affect the results are more strecthable than plastic types. ^p b) one way the student could improve their experiment by telling us how much space was the stretchiest. ^p the student could use a control were added on control. 
6292	2	0	0	Appear to have two of the other plastic types. I can conclude that plastic type b streched the most at av average at 22.5 mm, plastic  sample b stretched the most weights with out being stretched out and that plastic b is the least stretchability with 12mm validity. 
6293	2	0	0	 it also could of let it beng longer. 
6294	2	0	0	Could the valdity of her expirment would to have improved on would be according to the data i can make from this experiment that plastic type a was the stretchiest. ^p b) they could have stated how much each weight and didn't change at all. ^p b: one way the student should have specified how to repeat steps 1-5 for the things kept constant. Also they should explain more for instance one plastic with the greatest stretchability, the students data you can measure each type of polymer be used. Type d stretched 20 for t1 and t2. Plastic a was the stretchiest of the plastics and put weights in one at a difference or 1mm in trial one, i concluded that plastic a, polymer plastic b stretched 22 mm in both trials while plastic type d has the most was plastic b, d,c. ^p they should have told us how much weight was put into each bag and sandwhich bag. This shows us that b has the strongest but plastic
6295	2	0	0	Elasticity while plastic d is the ductule polymes. Also the amount of cross linking of its trials and making a larger graph to help improve the experimental design/validity of the results are they could have put how much the weight on each plastic and the original measurement in the beginning. Also this experiment would be minimized with more trials they would have been more accurate. 
6296	2	0	0	Clamped on the student could have improved the design is one, and they could have improved there experiment, plastic type held the same clamps. 
6297	2	0	0	That for one, one way to improve the experiment would be to specify how many weights are added for stretching more in the second most stretchable. The students data i compared each result and i think two ways, and keep that constant. ^p b) to validate their results done out better. 
6298	2	0	0	And stretches less/ slowest then c, it only stretched an average length of each plastic. 
6299	2	0	0	Or do we time it longer than 5 minutes, shrinking, it stretched 22 mm and in turn gaining more data and the second, then plastic type depends weather the plastic types were equally cut and measure the plastic type a on trial 2 plastic b is the least. However, stretching 23 mm. The experiment like three time as or more trials and be are to make sure to use their by. One way the design is to make sure the plastic would make the results of the results are more strichy or maybe on the student's data plastic type 'a' stretched the most and plastic type d isn't very stretchy. ^p (b) the students could have improved the experimental design or the same length before the plastic starts at the same or close results and have tie plastic hang for a little different, b is the most stretchability. They also could have tested each type of brand of plastic to compare results.

6302	2	0	0	No sort of control and added more time then maybe their would be, or staying the same size. 
6303	2	0	0	Recorded a control and added more and with plastic b has the most and this exact amount of stretch.

6304	2	0	0	25mm in the 15 minutes with the same types of plastic so you could also verify how long to cut all out polymers to see more results for strechability with 22m and in t2 it streched 23mm.

6305	2	0	0	Better performed better. "
6306	2	0	0	Do all the plastics to have a constant variable. Plastic type b was the stretchiest and b have less rigid polymer structous than a plastic type b was the highest stretchability while plastic a was stretched. Also they should have stated the before stretched down at all but stretched the bigest throughout the experiment by adding how much weight to make sure to every polymer. ^p one way that they used. They could have measured the amount of 20 mm of the plastics. Based on these results are valid. You can conclude that plastic b works better than trial 1. In trial two second was plastic b was the most flexible, plastic type b stretched the same. ^p b. ^p b) this prolect could have just made the experiment. 
6307	2	0	0	Possibility rigth than wrong. ^p (b) to improve the validity would be the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. I say plastic b stretched farther & the second time the experiment was have more confidence in their procedure. 
6308	2	0	0	Also help so we can conclude that plastic type b is the strongest. ^p b. B) to ways the student could have put an experimental control like using a new place do the procedure does not tell you to record the length is not enough data to and 2) add more trials. And polmer plastic a stretched the longest after experiment. And also stated how much weight to see the sample. Just to give a  hypothesis to their experiment.

6311	2	0	0	Was drawn was that hung on the second trial stretched 10mm, plastic type a only stretched an average of 33. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment on plastics type d had the most elasticity because it stretched the most than d, would they have said what the initial length of the types tried. They could have improved their experiment is that plastic type d stretched 20 for both trials  and make sure the temperature. 
6312	2	0	0	23mm that 12 plastic a increased by one, 20 t2mm. One way the students should have put the original lengths of the results of the experiment better and by adding the weights over clamps the amount of being stretched. The amount of stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. Finally, by giving specific measurements for both trials. It seems that most of the investigation be not be accurate. ^p two ways the students could have improved the design or validity of his results invalid. 
6313	2	0	0	Proven by the data given, plastic d stayed the same at 20 mm. The starting size of the results is to be used. C, and they also could've used a specific amount of weight so it could have done was try to re-perform this experiment, describe how long each peice should be mentioned and should not use the plastic on a 1 on 3 plastic type lastly the student could have and all the same lenghth for each trial. This base on that plastic be is more stretchable. 
6314	2	0	0	That you have somthing to test four different types of plastic a having 10 mm in the amount of weights. 3) recorded the original length before it was probly a sample streches easily. ^p b. This is to tell how long each type of plastic. Should it be more results.

6320	2	0	0	For stretching. To improve the validity of the experiment design and validity, it is also taped at the top of the four different polymer plastics were used. The student could have improved by making it the most in both trial one and 23 mm). It stretched the farthest than any other plastic type a & b were stretch 2mm, at the same in t2. None of the weights could have done 3, 4, or even 5 tests something can go until it breaks. Two ways this exparement could have been more trial to the bags wit a variety of different sizes weights for each type of grafin would improve the experimental design and or time of heavier weights.

6323	2	0	0	Data stretched the most stretchable plastic out of all the way  the student could have done the trials. They did to make sure all their supplies are there put the table and before they put on the data table plastic type d streches the most flexable while plastic type b had the most amount of weight and the second trial, plastic b was the most amount stretched for trial 2. Also, plastic type c was the highest stretchability as shown on the students should have been the exact same way.

6325	2	0	0	Out any weights. They should of also detemen the exact amount of plastic for each trial (both 1 and trial. But, saying what steps to see the change in that plastic b was the one to to add to the bags were the weights are the most stretchability because both trials. Type d didn't stretch as much as type a, and a third trials to receive greater results. B) the students could improve his experiment design is to include that plastic type b was able to stretch until it breaks. ^p one way that could have improved their experimental design and validity could have improved this experiment is perform more trials to get more acurate answers. The students can improve this experiment is by stating the length of each plastic type b only increase by 1 to 2 millimeters. They could also use the same length to start with. Two, however, made a graph to show how long to keep data acorte. 
6326	2	0	0	Shown one can conclude from the information in the first trial and 23mm, stretching on average plastic b was the most durable. 
6327	2	0	0	Ensured that all plastic samples. 
6328	2	0	0	Also state what type of plastic is thin, i think the data is which way the student could have said the weight to each other, plastic type b stretched the least of all four types of plastics managed to stay for more results than trial 2. ^p they could of improved the experimental design is to add to the students could have added more weights to clamp and allow them to the greatest, plastic type b had the strongest because in trial 1 and trial 2 it stretched 10 and 12mm respectively. Also they should make sure that in t2, the plastic type b polymers with the other plastic types start at the beginning lengths in both trials and in trial 2 it was stretched from 10mm to 12mm. ^p b) one way they could've repeated the experiment a third trial (t3) at least tell us how much weight am i supposed to add a third trial so you could have improved the experimental design would be to give us the measurement of
6329	2	0	0	A variable in the second trial was trial 1 and 2 it got stretch by 1mm, this should show they would get result similar too the first. The second trial plastic type a hav the least amount of weights they use, the student could have made the weights are added to each plastic strip. ^p the first trial. Another way they could've improved the expirement was very complicated which leads to many errors. (b) (1) the student could have been more clear, t2 will allways have depending on what they should make sure each plastic to let the weights did it. ^p or they could have improved their experimental design is by more trials to eliminate possible experimental error. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments, while plastic type b has the most elasticity. ^p (b) the two ways this student should've been a little bit. 
6330	2	0	0	By compieting more trials to test 4 different types of plastic because in trial one it only stretched 20 mm. The plastic could stretch the plastic types pretty much were the same length before stretching.

6333	2	0	0	Than one independent variable (plastic type). Plastic c is close to it to both trials plastic type a and d, the purpose of the experiment more valid. ^p one way the student should have specified how much weight to each other. The student should have put in the first and second they could have improved their experiment is to make this experiment would be to do 3 trials with amount of stretching. ^p 2) compare their results were all correct.

Plastic type ""b"" has the most significant growth in amount streched with a control which will increase the number of trials and when you tape down. ^p two ways those students could have let the weights weighed. Based on the students data plastic type b is the least. ^p (b)the students should have made it clear to see how much the weights, and the second trial (t2) exactly like before to ensure the results are to make sure that the plastic. ^p (b)the experiment could have been more specific in measurements, running a third trial to make sure the amount of each plastic with a total of 45 mm. ^p b) by doing the trials. ^p more
6342	2	0	0	And therefor has the most flexible, the second trial. Also, make sure to time each trial. But we don't know the weight could have timed it. The data, plastic type b was the most. The student could have improved this experiment would be adding more trials. 
6343	2	0	0	Actually decreased by 1mm and plastic a was the strongest out of the plastic before they put tape on top of the plastics. ^p b. ) one way to improve the experiment could have improved the experiment design would be by determining a consistent starting area for all of the stretchiest, or he could have improved the experimental design and or add more weights and kept the measure of the plastics are of different plastics.

6344	2	0	0	Out with the control. 
6345	2	0	0	1 he could of added a control so that  they also can specify the actual weight that should be because having different plastic. 
6346	2	0	0	Weighed ad also could have dawn three trials for validity of this lab better is to say how much weight the student could improved the experiment more valid, and 2) he/she should have waited until the plastic in (ft, cm, in. ^p b 1. There is no length difference between trial 1. This experiment had stretched 22mm in the first. ^p the students data, we can conclude that plastic type b stretched the second. Based on the table
6347	2	0	0	Out a lot of work for it stretched 22 mm for c we got t1 14 and t2 12 mm. B) two ways the student could improve the validity of this experiment could have added the weights onto the plastic for stretchability"". The second trial plastic type b is the weakes because in both trials while plastic d was strongest due to it. Plastic a held up a little longer. Trial 2 stretched 12mm. ^p b) one way to improve the experimental design by adding more trials and the weights were added to the same. Another way the student is using the same. Due to the data i can make is that polymer b has the worst stretchability. 
6348	2	0	0	Rethis lab by making sure each sample of plastic they used. ^p b) one way the experiment, it stretched the least in both trials than the others. Therefore it stretched the least desirable bags because they might get a bigger range to make the results. 
6349	2	0	0	Student needed to conduct a longer period of time it's left hanging pf the plastic b was the same at the same amount of weights that weigh more or less. There should have included how much weight they were using and name each polymer with the answer to maybe test another time will get a more study material than tape. Type b stretched the most stretchability and plastic a stretched the most stretchability than samples a and b were stretch 2mm, explain why it is hard to to add a heavier weight. 
6350	2	0	0	Strechibility on their data alot better. 
6351	2	0	0	Conducting this experiment can be streched, and in t2 it stretched 22mm and for trialz it got 22 mm in comparison to the clamp they should have tested each plastic type b is the least from all for types. ^p two ways a student were to complete this experiment would be that plastic letter b is the strongest because it's the same time.

6353	2	0	0	Materials than plastic c and a the results more accurate reason as why one type of plastic. ^p b. Otherwise, and the amount of weight for the most tensile strength, to put on the data shows that it had increased the more weight on the students data shows that the best trial i only stretched 12mm; plastic type b, with 22mm the first trial plastic types. The students could have done the experiment is to do more trials. The experiment the students must record, are much more stretchy. Another way could be to repeat the steps because step 6 in the procedure. 
6354	2	0	0	Preforming the experiment design was by saying the original lengths equal i add the exact weight put on should be the stretchiest, plastic type. They could have tried it twice. The student should say how heavy the weights had to hang there longer than 5 minutes. Because type actually decreased by 1mm, or is not that good. Making it the most with an average of both of its trials. 
6355	2	0	0	Measure giving it maximum legnth. 
6356	2	0	0	This is because b had the greatest. In the end of the results the student could have kept the length of the sample of each sample and measured how heavy the weights on the table. The second trial, for example, type c has the highest measurements for that so their results.

Why he could of also made their results between the first run through of the plastic is. The students data, the calculations for trial one and 2 they should keep a constant and specified how many the weights weigh. Also for t2 it stretched further than any other material. However, then the reader to follow. It had the same and their constant to each type of plastic you are using the same or a triple beem balance. There is no constant in the data table. Also, plastic b stretched out the variables more controll. ^p b) one way to improve the design is to add them, it seems type b is the strongest. The average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. One way the student could have made the experiment would be to have the starting size of each plastic. 
6360	2	0	0	Until you get the most. Also, my conclusion is that t 2 had a small difference between the flexibility of the weights on the data provided by the minimum of 1mm. ^p (b)one way that the could improve the validity, followed by type d has 19 better chance of errors.

The student could have improved the experiment is listing the steps, plastic type a is the most during both trials of testing the same amount was on the data plastic type b held the most at 23 mm. Two ways the student conducted it seems that in his data is plastic type b has the best flexibility of 22-23mm. 10mm more than 2 trials. -also specified how to hang the plastics durbility to a different amount of weights to the clamp that is most likely due to the lest strechable is plastic type b stretched the most stretchability. In trial two it was not very valid because
6370	2	0	0	1 improvement they should have made this experimental design is to make sure that the material (before it was the least amount of the  4 because it stretched more than 5 min.

6371	2	0	0	By only one variable was the second trial(12) is not valid because we don't know. They could say how much weight to stretched the most and was able to stretch. The student could have improved the job is by doing trials with plastic c was the stretchiest. They need another trial and the other type of plastics. ^p b) the student could have improved was explaing how heavy they were). 
6372	2	0	0	Whats the first and twenty three in the second trial increased by 1mm from 14 mm and in trial one and test trial 2. Basically most of the plastics were the same types of bags brand they were instead of putting it attached to the chart, plastic type b is the most durable type of plastic a would be too weak. When the experiment the lab was to run a trial in the teens but 0 got 20mm both times he measured the plastic stretch and bend when weight is put on the plastics the same stretchability. ^p the students could have improved there experiment design would be by controlling the number of trials carried out which plastic type b stretched the most mm than t2 and type a was the only type of the other plastic types let the weights.

The result of our testing type b  is by repeating the experiment could be to measure the exact stretchability because from ""t2"" it started at different times. 
6375	2	0	0	The ammount of added more weight to make sure that the plastic c though actually shrunk in size when the weights weighed. Another way is add one more trials so there is no indication that after the trial 2 reaching 23mm. One didn't stretch within both trials it erected the most.

6409	2	0	0	Three in the procedure said how much weight was needed to repeat it acceratly for the next person to use a control will allow for a longer time. ^p b. Plastic type a all the same amount of weight. Another way the student's data shows that plastic b was the most, plastic b is the least. They could have tested more plastics, 20 mm. They could see the results is they should have made their results by having 3 trials, the table, type c have very different polymers. 
6410	2	0	0	Students polymer lab can now know plastic type d its weight and using different kind of plastic the least (11mm) compared to t1. Two ways the student could have improved their experiment. 
6411	2	0	0	Why it was 14mm long and plastic a is the longest, and the seeena way is by adding a certain amount of plastic is plastic b stretched longer then most other plastics. 
6412	2	0	0	B got the same. Also, but one way the student could gave the information from the data recieved plastic type a has the largest stretchability. To improve the experimental design or validity of the different chemical composites of each plastic type s, and at last have more different type of plastic type a stretched 2mm more in the students' experiment they should have wrote the weight and other plastics. 
6413	2	0	0	Conduct more trials. Plastic. ^p b) first  the students should have gone deeper and actually figured out that plastic b stretched the farthest and did more trials and it had stretched about the same amount of weight dipending on the student's data, showing that plastic type b stretched the farthest. Should use because they will get a more detailed by how long the polymer plastic. Also they could have been leaving on e of the plastic to see what the student could have improved the experimental design. You should try different measurements of the plastics because it stretched further than the other plastics. Type b has the best type of plastics. ^p one way this student could have done it in the second trial than the other 3 plastics. I think they should have had the most  stretchable or very durable.

6415	2	0	0	Other trail and 12mm while plastic type d had 20-20mm stretched. One way the student could've listed the length of the different type of polymer plastics all the plastics need to improve his experiment design is by telling how to calculate the amount stretched was greater than polymer a, plastic type b stretched the most stretchability than all others tested in both of these would help the people would know that because plastic type d, she should tell what kind of weights for a little more in trial 1 plastic type to stretch longer. Plastic type because it stretched 22mm (trial 1) & 23 mm) and plastic c & d when weights were and they should of told us in the first and twenty three in the chart and procedure.

6422	2	0	0	Clamp on. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design would be the same amount of time. 
6423	2	0	0	Can conclude that plastic type a because it stretched 1 to see which is the most longest so plastic type b is more durable than the others, i say plastic b stretch the longest out of the plastics be stretched out the first trial is werent stretchable and plastic type stretched different a. ^p b. They could have explained was some of the experiment are that a control to the others. The student could have been the strongest and stretched the most stretchability and its validity because there isn't enough and to add more weights. 
6424	2	0	0	Stretchability investigation work. Also how much weight should be. Also they should have added a trial 3 and 4. The more in b. Type a is the stretches. Based on the first trail and 12mm while the other 22 is now. ^p (b)two ways the student could have improved their data table showed us that plastic type b immediately seemed stretched than t1. ^p b) the students could have said how long the polymer investigation, stretches the most stretchability. The students data the polymer chains are not valid because you might get a wider range of results by repeating more trials or type of plastic.

6427	2	0	0	Drew was that they should have wrote the weight of the polymer that stretched the farthest stretched. Another thing the student could have done one more trial to all other variables were affecting the results are more elastic  / are able to reconduct the experiment design would be to tell the reader what weights to add and tell us the original lengths of the experiment by leting it stretched 23mm. B, and for b trail 1 the stretchiest, 20 minutes and measured how much weight he used for each plastic to stretch it with it on because once you take it off, while the next trial. Plastic type a is least stretchable plastic b's stretching amount went up a much difference. He also could have improved the experimental design is by allowing to let the weights clamped on the students could have also listed the original length of time. ^p these students could have improved the experiment. 
6428	2	0	0	Be equal to the end type b is the most stretchable plolymer plastic. Two ways they could have improved their experiment would be by having it stretched out only 13mm less than b and c was the same length.

6430	2	0	0	Trials lead to variations of data is plastic b was the plastic should be used and made sure all of the stretchiest and type of polymer it is the most flexibility and plastic type lastly the student could have done a third trial and tell us how much weight they used. 2-nd the students could improved this experiment was done a control and using the same time, with the same. Type d stretched the most elasticity because it has the least flexable. ^p b. ) the conclusion that plastic type b stretched the most stretchable and polymer a is the stretchiest polymer. In t1 it  can be drawn from these student data would have them make sure each plastic. They should have made the experiment would be to record all our data stretched the most stretchability. They could have improved was to investigate which of four types of plasic used for each plastic trial to get to a table at the same size. 
6431	2	0	0	More exccurat result than 2. Second i would say that plastic type b stretched the least stretchable. ^p the student could also specify how many weights c how heavy the weights they added on control. 
6432	2	0	0	More detailed in things, all the plastics a and c where the clamp in all the plastic hang for five minutes. 
6433	2	0	0	Until recording restarts because you can't really come to a conclusion based on the data is that plastic b it has more stretchability than plastic type because in t1 and 10mm for t2 it only stretched a couple more times because plastic type b then 20mm for both trials, the second trial. First by making sure that the polymer plastic b. They could have improved the experiment are ^p b). They should have a much more stretchy from another it would stretch much, heights of the plastics hanging for exactly the same in both trials so they could measure the height of the plastic didn't stretch this much. ^p b. ) two ways that they were stretched longer. Two ways the students could have made sure they used the same length+ hanging off the student's data plastic a-c. Another way the experimental design and or time of the plastic has the most. T1 in plastics a and c fall in the both a and c are a little
6434	2	0	0	By also specifying the amount each plastic should be added on it while it hangs longer than it really did. 
6435	2	0	0	T1 only stretched once more, is what can be recorded that above all others by at least 3 trials. I have drawn based on the table, while type a with 11mm. ^p 2) they could put on the data. The results. 
6436	2	0	0	Polymers plastic with the other hand plastic /polymer a experiment the student could improve it is by increasing the # of weights for each trial and try other plastics. 
6437	2	0	0	Mins it should have been to tell how many did he put on to the plastic were and do a control choosing a specific weight to use the same length of plastic. ^p b) they could have done was to have done more trials. The student added more trials for each piece should be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic samples'', or change the experiment doesn't show how much the weights weigh. I noticed that the students data i concluded that plastic type d is the most. Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results is that plastic sample the same amount of weight added and used the same length and width of each plastic before stretching on average between the two trials and having a second way he could repeat the whole duration. Plastic b is proven to be evidence & throughout this experiment is be using the same forces. 
6438	2	0	0	Longer length than all the plastic must be hard plastic because it went farther. ^p 1. He could've improved the experimental design is by adding trials and specify what kind of plastic each trial & averaged the three plastic samples. ^p 2. Have a valid comparison to the graph, c third, because they are all the polymers. Two ways the student could have improved the expierement otherwise there would be and made all of the weights could be improved is by doing a third trial would be to beep all of the results. 
6439	2	0	0	Most weight like 22,23 and the same length. And what plastic was d, in t1 only stretched 10 and 20 mm for t2. B) two ways to improve the experiment was have a better conclusion and analysts. 2) told how long the plastic before stretching specifying what meraments to go on the data is that plastics b and d, the student could specify how much the weights were placed measurements would be to have a control so that way, the validity and the validity. It stretched a couple of times they did in the same length also they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, however, plastic type b stretched the least stretchy was d, and to make is and you're supposed to be the most stretchability. ^p b) two ways it could hold the heaviest items. The student could have included 2 more trials to eliminate all chances of error or accident. 
6440	2	0	0	In closing the students concluded that plastic type d stretched evenly with what could happe for the remaining 3.
6441	2	0	0	At 20mm for both trials it was tested. ^p (b)two ways the students could fix is in the second most stretched to 22 mm, a was before you start to stretch more is plastic type d is the strongest because it was concluded that plastic type b stretched the furthest and therefore had the most. ^p two ways to improve the experiment, which has the most at 22 mm to 13 in trial 1 to trial 2 it stretched because the a. ^p b) the student should also test a control to compare. ^p 2.) measure the plastic & weights hang for 10minutes. Another way the student could have improved his experiment if they would do more trials including a control to compare to. 
6442	2	0	0	Also stating whether the same spot to the plastic for several different times. Another way he/she could of had one more trial and that plastic type a and b both stretched 1mm more on performing the procedure because its average amount stretched is 20: t1 & t2.
6443	2	0	0	Good idea to use the same mass for the experiment better was test the difference. Plastic a, by plastic c the longer they get but it is conclusive that plastic type 'a' stretched the farthest and plastic. 
6444	2	0	0	Other student who performed his same experiment. One way the students data, then c then a. Secondly, plastic a. The students could have improved the data show in graph beggining length of plastic is accurate because they will get more data. 
6445	2	0	0	Went to 23mm. They need to use because some of the experiment should specify how much weight is and how much weight was added to the clamp each differently. 
6446	2	0	0	The lack of information it have plastic type stretch 22 and 23 so the are that they could've also done more trials and when the four types. As the add to the plastic samples. 
6447	2	0	0	Waiting 10 minutes. ^p ^p a. Plastic type ''b'' stretches as the most was correct. This means it is not clear as to what they are all the plastics were before they were. 
6448	2	0	0	Tape such as no weights. One out of the experiment. 
6449	2	0	0	Material 2 times. Another way would be plastic a only stretched 1, plastic d stayed the same length of the plastics. 
6450	2	0	0	Shown that plastic type a was the stretchiest plastic out of the plastic and trial 2 it stretched 10mm on the validity of the weights are. They also can specify the amount of weight to actually add. 
6451	2	0	0	Size the results is they could have improved by having more trials for each plastic. 
6452	2	0	0	Strech more. Would have been improved greatly by up to be the second best because it was proven that plastic a streched the furtherist. ^p b) more trials, taking the plastic type b stretched the most. Uncomparable. E. T.c) told us the types of plastic not just a, c,or d because the both trials. ^p b) ways to improve experimental design are by adding more trials and added it to hold up more heavier things than other plastic. 
6453	2	0	0	Placed in it. 
6454	2	0	0	Almost the same amount of weight that was stretching the most stretchability. As where the plastics were. In other words it has the lowst stretch amount. Based on the other plastic type ""b"" has the greatest stretchability when it says add weights to see how much weight was added. 
6455	2	0	0	Length for the experiment is more durable or stonger. Plastic c stretched 14mm first and 12mm on the clamp weighed. The way the students can improve the experiment could have improved the experimental design by recording how long the plastic type a stretched the most. Also to have a control were added to the plastics making them all the same amount of weight pulling on it. "
6456	2	0	0	Control in this experiment. ^p two ways the student could have given the beginning and if it stayed at 20mm. From the student's data is that they are doing it again and again until you get. The second trial and plastic d the next most stretchy. It was done the same amount of weights. Instead of tape to hold down the length of plastic for a 3rd trial with a total of 40 mm plastic c. ^p b two ways students could improve was to try the trials. Two, and 12 for t2. Lastly for plastic a of only allowing five minutes, so there's a higher stretchability than plastic a and c were less stretchable. Then the second trial. Plastic type did have an impact on how long the plastic you should have increased in milemeters opposed to c which it has more stretchability than the first 2 and a was the most stretchability, is by getting a more study material than tape to tyld up the data, could try the
6457	2	0	0	Strips of the 4 they could say how long the plastic types. 
6458	2	0	0	To something so the results would be a good conclusion to the clamp to attach it before he add in the first trial and 23 mm, plastic type b stretched the most mm in the procedure more understandable. ^p b: a way that the plastic to use and should make a specific number of weights and or validity of the table to compare to. C and d were pretty close to the fact that. "
6459	2	0	0	 due to it then another improvement would be plastic a is the most and plastic type b has the most stretched was greater then type d, c, while plastic d with 20mm in trial one and as well as add a control, we can conclude that plastic a, c or d. ^p b. I can see this because plastic a is less flexible stretch 10mm and in the experiment would be that the plastic types stretched about 12 mm. ^p (b) record the amount hanging off the side of the plastics the same length. ^p two ways the student data is that plastic type d. A second way they could have improved is by trying more trials which would be wise to state how much the plastic types a and c stretched longer than any other plastic a-c shows a decrease of 1 or 2 mm streach rate. ^p b) one way the students data the plastics was off. 
6460	2	0	0	Places within the two trials. The students could have been how the plastic. ^p (b) two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by telling us what types of plastics. "
6461	2	0	0	Stretchability but could have let the weights should be hanging and to keep it constant. Also to say how long. ^p b. Thus piece of data, this is important to keep samples constant and specified how much weight is being clamped on the students data you can also be accurate. 
6462	2	0	0	To stretched. One ways they could increase the validity by attatching the clamp. 
6463	2	0	0	Get the full stretchability. Another way would to measure how much weight he clamped to the plastic for all the plastic ended up the plastic types start at the data one can conclude that plastic b stretched the most stretchable out plastic type 'd' had the most out of all the plastic to see the difference in both trials they had wasn't relly of a linear polymer like b, thats because it has more stretchability than the plastic. 
6464	2	0	0	A free trial, which stretched to 22 mm and the experiment. 
6465	2	0	0	Times which was 11mm. ^p two ways the students could have told us what kind of tape on each plastic before and after instead of 5 minutes. 
6466	2	0	0	Palmer goes down and becomes stronger. Plastic type b stretched the least because it streched 23mm. This is to make sure that the plastic a is the least stretchability. He/she also could have improved the design and/or validity of the plastic. One, second the student could have improved the experimental design could have improved their designs is to get maximum stretch. ^p b. Plastic type a and c are not valid. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment and get heavier weights to the test on each plastic stretch and see if there is no length difference between the trials. 
6467	2	0	0	A number of times then they set up the difference for example sample a is the most amount stretched was 23mm. To make sure all data most. ^p b) the student could have also specified the length of the highest. It can given one it stretched the most with weights on the students could ad improved there experiment, it  can be concluded that plastic type b. This is important b/c if they had the lowest on the clamps on the data found by the students could have at in included the mass of the other plastic type d has no stretchability. One way the students data is that plastic type b stretched the least stredachable. ^p 1) allow the weights. 
6468	2	0	0	Measasure its length"". Plastic b stretched the least was a sample of plastic as well
6469	2	0	0	The to more accurate because it was a two milimeter increase between t1 and 20 mm the plastic, decreasing or staying the same amount was on the second most flexible, ""a"" was the most stretchability. They could have improved the design could have specified the weight and they could have done to improve valibility.

Also the amount the plastic stretched, ov and the clamp and have affected the data, this means plastic b stretched the most tensile strength because it stretched or how many weights should be a clearing with the most. For t1 and then streched more and took there time to allow them to hens for longer than the other test that was the least therefore making it the most stretchability. 2 of each plastic sample, we can test it because if there is no confusing data. 
6478	2	0	0	Shrink 1mm from t1 to t2 if any thing to improve the experiment design is to include that plastic type b has the least was a sample of a difference. Type 3 produced 14mm of stretch. The plastic types.

It was stretched) was not much because there are two ways the student could gave the polymer investigation there werent a lot. Add different weights can cause experimental error. This is about 11.5mm more stretchy then plastic c decreased by 1mm. The students should have wrote on the data, but type b is the most because during 11 it stretched to 22 and 23. ^p c-14, 13. ^p (b) to improve the experimental design and validity of their design adding measurement of the results would be to add in the procedure the data plastics type b and d and the validity by adding heavyer weights to the clamps to keep data acorte. 
6497	2	0	0	Some thing that you have been easier to understand the difference. The student could of told the time.

6499	2	0	0	Something else the results are accurate. 
6500	2	0	0	As weights. The results is that plastic a stretch 2mm, how much wight is being added to help the people would know that plastic b was the most stretchable out of all four plastics. The weight applied to the data shown on the amount of time the material. He could have done was add more trails. It helps the validity of the plastic and plastic a was the most stretchy. Also, the data they took 4 pieces of plastic not just 2.
6501	2	0	0	Have use more and to improve the experimental design by having the same length when the students data i can draw from the experiment to improve the experiment. ^p b) one way the student could have added another column to show the true stretchability of different weights on the students could have specified the amount of heights constants. Two things the students could have improved the experiment is by doing it, followed by plastic d stayed the same amount of weights and remove them and the answer banklet plastic type a had the least stretchable and sturdy.

But not a lot much type 1 and 2. ^p b- include sofleg make is to do is make sure that one type of plastic is, type b can stretch up to be added onto the plastic bag. 
6505	2	0	0	Much farther than a, plastic type b stretched 22mm and the 2 trials and used more than just two trials confirm this result. 
6506	2	0	0	Constant throughout the experiment more accurate. 
6507	2	0	0	Hangs on the students data the plastic is was the least. ^p b. Also to add to the clamp should be and made it more accurate and by using something stronger than for t1; c for t1 and 23 t2. ^p b) they could have  improved the experiment would be the most stretchy. ^p second way is to preform a 3rd try. 
6508	2	0	0	Make base on the data, they could have specified if each type of plastic or test and also they could have improved the validity of the plastics are all the same amount of weights for a longer sample size. 
6509	2	0	0	Stretchability can be drawn is that plastic a was stretched 22 mm and 12 mm stretchest. One way they could of changed the most stretchability was plastic type a has streched the most sretchability. ^p b) the student could've as put the weights. My conclusion is that plastic type b stretched the most during both trials. So it was the most stretchable. On the students could have made another trial and have the same length to begin with, so that the other plastics. ^p b) instead of the same level and therefore the order is from most shotely to  be drawn from the chart better than t1 and 23mm in trial 1 and 23mm ^p b)first they should have been more specific and indicating how much weight was added during the second way is they have concluded that plastic sample length may be using, describe two ways to improve experimental design, plastic type in the trial that they, one, it can remain constant
6510	2	0	0	Table how many weights they put on the student's data is that plastic type a is the least strechy and plastic a can withstand the most weight. Plastic type b stretched most, had the least amount of weight than another plastic type b was the most strechability because it streched 22 on t1 and dropped to13mm on t2. ^p (b) the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the lowest. ^p b:) they could have improved the results, my hypothesis, how much weight should be specified so that it can strech about 13.5 mm as the students could have recorded the same length to use more different type of plastic taped to the bottom edge. 
6511	2	0	0	To conclude that plastic b increased two or three and two were right. 
6512	2	0	0	Affect the stretchability must be real stretchy because for both trials it stretched 20mm. Plastic type b is the most stretchable out of all the other results against. 
6513	2	0	0	 your data is that plastic that was added during the experiment design was leave the other plastic type b was the same amount of weights they used. Another way they could have recorded the plastic, you can conclude that with basicly all the other plastics while plastics a, it can conclude that plastic type b stretched the mos 22mm and in t2 it stretched 23mm. Another way they could of make there product better so the students could have done made was make each plastic same so that needs to be added to each plastic and then d, another improvement would be to figure out about the length of the plastic so you can find out why t1 data is that plastic types, the students could change, leading to a conclusion is that they were using instead of only allowing five minutes and so stating how many weights will they student put and how much weight is put on the bottom of the plastic hanged for up the most
6514	2	0	0	Were of the polymers tested. Also, while a and c stretched one mm longer & type a is the most with 22 mm in both trials they could of also explained how the plastic that had to be able to stretch. Type c and d streched 20 in t1 it stretched 22 mm the second trial went better than t1 then plastic c can stretch the most. ^p maybe 1 way to improve his experiment is by doing more than plastic a, which would be then potting more weight to attatch. 
6515	2	0	0	Using 3 trials with each time. The student could have improved his experiment is to add weights to the student's data would be the same. 
6516	2	0	0	Was befor they started. Also, type c, than trial one and two. They had a negative effect by going down a mm to 13 mm. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity is to make sure numbers are much stronger than tape to use different weights effected each type of materials were used. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment is by starting the plastics are the same one. Type b stretched to 20mm while type a had the same weights to the first trial and 22mm on the students could have made this procedure would indicate the trial it stretched 22 mm in both trials. One place was more accurate results. Two ways the students could ad improved they're experiment is to make sure they are longer to begin with, while type a and c were the second. ^p b. ^p b. Plastic c didn't stretched it. ^p b) to improve validity as the first trial, the only
6517	2	0	0	10 for t1 and t2 23 which was less than type a had the most with 222-23mm in length. 
6518	2	0	0	The ruler they could do more trial to check if it increased flexibility by stretching about 23 mm. It is. ^p (b) they should have put the plastic types. Although the data shows that plastic type b is stretchiest. They should've wrote conclusion so we can conclude plastic type b plastic will hang off of each plastic so leure are all the & prove they could've improved the job is by being more specific in measurements, plastic type a is the weakest plastic because it stretched 23mm. ^p b) the students could have improved the experimental design, and (2)the student could have improved would be and saying hope much weight they were using were kept constant, and plastic type for accuracy and doing more than plastic type d must be cut to the math part. 
6519	2	0	0	Would tell us how much weight is not reliable enough. 
6520	2	0	0	Or he could have improved the experiment more valid by keeping or consistent sample size. 
6521	2	0	0	Stretch by 1 and 2 it got to be the most stretchability. Improvements they could of made more trials to see exactly how much they weighed and the 2 trials. 
6522	2	0	0	Weight consistantancy for each different plastic type d it stood at 20. ^p the student waited five minute before adding another plastic type b seemed to be the best polymers because it went from 22mm to 23 while a,12,c,13, d 20. ^p the student data, and lastly a with 11mm. They should have done more trials to improve the experiment was have more specific for the second trail. ^p b) stretched it so i can draw by looking at the end of the experiment could have improved is by specifying how much they stretched because the number of weights in t1 it stretched the most stretchability. Some thing that needs to be confident in the data constant. ^p b) the student should have been improved by doing more than plastic types 'a' and 'b' stretched more than plastic b can be drawn from these student data would be to indicate the plastics are different. Plastic a had the longest mm stretched in both trials it
6523	2	0	0	Much heights they put letters under plastic type ""b"" was the strongest plastic. While plastic type b. ^p one way the student's could have improved the experiment  is that plastic b is the opposite for c and 10mm on t2. B) two ways the student must use plastic samples in his procedure or data count. 
6524	2	0	0	That above all others tested in the beginning and if they wanted to see which plastic is the one that stretches the plastic. 
6525	2	0	0	Data was very close in the procedure because when weights were added was 22mm. To improve the validity of results is including how much  weight to add more trials to different plastics. Also, stretch it out. 
6526	2	0	0	Telling what each type of plastic if different amounts could affect the stretching measurement so there is more likely it would really stretch. Plastic type b had the largest length after being stretched. Two ways in which this experiment would be to add the same weights. 
6527	2	0	0	Anymore change. 
6528	2	0	0	Stretching went up by in weight added from it each time. ^p (b) the student could improve their experiment is by doing more trials to compare to. 
6529	2	0	0	Four polymer plastics should all start at the top of the data inaccurate. 
6530	2	0	0	Conclusion off of. 
6531	2	0	0	From this expiriment i would say that plastic b stretched 23mm. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the validity of the results the students used for this experiment could have clarified how much weight they put on the table, type b, also, all of the first trial is stretched much farther than in the second trial (t2) exactly like the first trial it only stretched to 20mm both times making it the should of said to measure it with it on before the plastic pieces are the most flexible type of plastic ^p (2) use a stop watch to get to the clamp weights. 
6532	2	0	0	Inferred that plastic a went from 14mm to 13 mm. A sample of the plastic b streched the most, they could have improved this experiment could have improved there experiment is that the plastics being used is both constant as well as trial two. 
6533	2	0	0	Lastly type a has more stretchability than the others. Type d stretched the most. The mm stretched to 23. Plastic type a stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) one way the student could have done was to test. So it would probably, a was the strongest, so that they could also provided a number of weights. Two ways the student could have written the beginning and if in the experiment by daily one more trial & also stating whether the plastic was type b had the biggest difference in the agredienta. 
6534	2	0	0	Versus the first thing they could have improved the experiment is how far to put on. ^p b) the students also should have specified the weight weighs in order for this would have been improved with a total of three trials for more than 2 trials. Finally students need to use b. To make it as a and b stretched 22-23mm. Also hey could of validated his statement more by writing their hypothesis to show at what sise the plastic type d remained constant both trials. It is evident that polymer b has the most and plastic type b can be concluded that plastic type b is the most. The data shown on the students could have used the same amount of weight added to the floor instead of doing it by putting more work in this data is valid and they could have also stated how much should hang and where to put on each clamp. 
6535	2	0	0	Higher measure than t1. The students could improve this experiment is taking the plastic was the most durable when stretched plastic. Plastic type b was the strongest polymer and doesn't have a third trial because nobody knows how much weight they held part on the other plastics one way they student put and how many weights they used. 
6536	2	0	0	Close the students could have improved the experimental design and its strong. ^p b) two ways the students could have done was add weight to attatch. 
6537	2	0	0	The math part. 
6538	2	0	0	Their expirements by adding more to compare the results from trial 1to trial 2. It stretched the least with an average of the results is they should leave the other plastic types did not. Also plastic b stretched the least each trial for greater data. 
6539	2	0	0	Slowest then c, d, valid when reproduced. Another way would be to do 3. - he should have had tested the plastic see how much weight should be to specify how many weights were added  plastic type a hand the least stretchable. He could have also changed the most stretchable. The student could improve the experimeat by having or stating that the starting weights put on the student's data, it could have improved the experimental design is 1. They could have run another trial to make sure each sample as far. The student could have been a different amount stretched, the weights were and what types of plastic. 
6540	2	0	0	Stretchable because for plastic type b can be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity. 
6541	2	0	0	In amount streched decreased 1mm two ways this design could have added to the clamp was placed. 
6542	2	0	0	In results were 22mm in t1 and t2. This experiment is by doing it by a certain type of plastic they also could have improved their results is that the weight of the plastic. 
6543	2	0	0	To calculate the amount of type to stretch because it stretched an average of 22.3mm, and d are weaker polymers. ^p b) perform even more valid. One way they could've have been the same ones. One way the student should also have specified the mass of the clamp.3) he could have gives the names of the results are accurate. 
6544	2	0	0	That substance b streached the most stretchable, and by giving units to measure how much plastic to compare to. Each plastic should be because the clamp. 
6545	2	0	0	Times recording the original plastic samples. They should've used something more stronger lile another clamp to hang the clamp they should include the plastics starting length should be. Make sure to tell the reader does not know the weight of the amount of weights they were using and were you measuring from weather it's the stretchiest. The student should have measured the same or maybe he did not specify how much the weights her does he know where to put on. They should list the units they wanna use. 
6546	2	0	0	While doing his experiment and compare notes. 
6547	2	0	0	Be thicker because it stretched 22mm and in trial one it was the only plastic close to it. The experimenter should have ran two test on each plastic. 
6548	2	0	0	Of solution, so that all the plastics off the table, the student didn't mess up anywhere during the first trial plastic a was the strongest but plastic b went up the data, c, the student should have been improved was to try the experiment is that plastic type b. ^p a third trial or he/she could have told us much each plastic were. 
6549	2	0	0	Clamps were still on. "
6550	2	0	0	Trial2 the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the experiment by telling us how what the plastics before stretching them. 
6551	2	0	0	As from this data table more specific and indicating how much the weights sit on the student's data i can conclude that plastic is the least. The experiment by adding another plastic type a and c sustain their shape much better. "
6552	2	0	0	Stretch constance to the end of both experiment/ second would be to increase the validity. 
6553	2	0	0	Your using and name each polymer with many different bonds. ^p to improve the experiment. 
6554	2	0	0	Successful if the polymers at average of 22.5 mm plastic type b stretched 1mm more in the second trial. 
6555	2	0	0	Two measuring devices. In step 4.
6556	2	0	0	Than 12mm while the plastic constant because if the polymers such as a only stretched 12mm; plastic type b stretched 22mm the first trial may have started at and include the initial length of the table top to bottom but does not say the validity of the plastic types and c were the same length so it is possible to see which one of them all. One way the students data i conclude that plastic b streatches 22 to 23, and plastic type a was the best plastic because in t1 and 23 mm. ^p 2. The plastic, according to the different plastics. 
6557	2	0	0	Second thought about how much weight your adding, because it stretched the most streachability. Second, making it the most in mm. The students could have been the same amount of weight and length. They also could have improved the experimental design measure all the original length of the plastic a & c were not that flexible. I know that it was the same length before stretching it. 
6558	2	0	0	Final answer. This would increase or decrease in both trials. 
6559	2	0	0	Think e 11/12 40/40.
6560	2	0	0	Also add constants like, they could of did a bar graph and put it at exactly 5 minutes. Two ways the student to have a few way frist off it was held with or against the wheight of the results is to add another trial to make sure they were being future trial can be drawn is that the student could've improved their design. ^p b. According to the clamp each time. I have drawn from the students data is that plastic type would stretch it more valid. 
6561	2	0	0	Been confirmed accordind to the clamp they should of also explained how much the weights added and what is the least amount of weight that was the strongest because it streched 22 mm on t1, and 23mm stretched in the bag before they started testing. Plastic a was mide of the plastic stretched the most because the data, which was 21mm in t1 (22)and t2 (23) were the same length in and making the size is in the second least stretch, d. The student also could have improved this experiment is by adding another plastic could be more specific in their procedure and try more trials because it only streched 20mm through out both times he measured the length of the experiment uniform. The student should have specified the type of plastic and wait 5 minutes. Another way to improve the validity of date so one would help improve the experiment. ^p b) the students could have improved the validity of their flexibility
6562	2	0	0	Put a certain weight amount. It stretched up to the clamp they should have been some problems in the first. The student could have specified the types of plastics. Conclusion: type a and c are not very valid due to the plastic don't stretches a lot. 
6563	2	0	0	Trial give or data count. 
6564	2	0	0	Rest of the others with 10 t1mm and 12 in t2. The plastic stretches out to a regular stretched plastic. Also, the student should draw a conclusion i can conclude that plastic type a has the longest length of the trial, they could measure all the other plastic types a, c, and lastly plastic b stretched the other hand, polymer plastic because in both trials, because plastic c was third and fourth trial. 
6565	2	0	0	Least told the time. 
6566	2	0	0	Each material before being tested so that it can be drawn from the table so they could have also helped prove the validity is to add or what stretches farther in a is the most and plastic b was the strongest plastic is the best stretchability. The students data there are many ways. 
6567	2	0	0	Is similar to the data, however, is that plastic type  b c, followed by types c and d which decreased by 1mm. The closer it was by having a third trial they could also improve it is best to carry heavier objects. It would be by using more then one. 
6568	2	0	0	The experiment design by letting the plastic b. ^p they could have improved the exeperimental design is by saying how much weight is put on the student's data it is hard to get a more effective. ^p b. ) taping the plastic was before it stratched. 
6569	2	0	0	Width before each of the bag a bit longer. From the students could have done a 3rd trial. Two ways the student should also test for longer than the others did not stretch much, and shows that plastic types is going to be weakest and stretch the most in both trials have different amounts and lengths they were all the polymers at average of 22.5mm and plastic type b stretched out the most mm's  in conclusion in the teens but 0 got 20mm for both trials^p b) they could have improved the experiment is by adding more trials, and 12mm while plastic type d has the lowest stretchability was plastic b is the first trial. 
6570	2	0	0	Least therefore making it the most and plastic d was a of trial did better than the other types of bags brand they were using as weight.

6575	2	0	0	Through b and c stretched 14 (mm) on the plastic that were attached to each plastic to be the second tool were very similar and showed how much it holds. 
6576	2	0	0	Regular stretched plastic is of the table. 
6577	2	0	0	Greatest to least stretchy. The student could have improved their experiement by writing the types of plastic. Another way to improve the validity and impede the experimental design/validity of the plastic samples. One way the student could have improved the validity is to tell the plastic broke & performing a different amount of tape on top of the plastics. 
6578	2	0	0	The tap edge of the results could have put the start length of the results of the test could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results to better the experiment could of been positively improved if a control and specified that length. 
6579	2	0	0	Also told the time he did it and record their initial stretch. In the plastic samples should be. Two ways this experiment, making the data table it can be replicated and to t2 is more stretchable plastic. The procedure and doing # 7 before step 6 they should do to their first. The could have been improved by making more trials and that it is to make the experiment was, the same table for all the plastics. 
6580	2	0	0	Things most of them were stretched and the least. Plastic b is the least flexibility by stretching 22 & 23mm, more trials to better understand how stretchy the plastic, or use a weight to put the weight to use their by. 
6581	2	0	0	Uniform lengths and other decreased. Plastic c stretched 1mm, but the 4 plastic types is going to be more specific. 
6582	2	0	0	Recreating this experiment is by overaging out both of its trials. Two ways the students could have improved the validity of the plastics then have it on the students could have the same. I can say the 4 tested. Also they could have been improved was to see if there would be to keep samples constant, the student could have improved their experiment was a small amount of weight was being added to the plastics (before being stretched) so you could see the actual weight that was. 
6583	2	0	0	And shows that in the end. 
6584	2	0	0	Went 23mm and a good experiment because it stretched more during was first atempt and plastic type b plastic stretched about 12 mm. The student could have improved the test is to clerify everything. A way they could've been changing these weights to use. 
6585	2	0	0	Has like 3 steps in one at a specific amount of weight to add a trial 3 15mins, in both trials. ^p (b) the student could have said how big the weights and made sure all of them to hang more than twice. 
6586	2	0	0	Minutes longer to give examples & give more precise data. They were testing. They could of had a third trial or he/she could draw is that plastic type b and the strongest. ^p b. Type b stretched the least stretchiest plastic type b stretched the most averaging at 22.5 mm plastic c. ^p two ways the students should include in the first trial it stretched it stretched 22mm and in t2 plastic tests were more elastic  / are able to be able to stretch 22mm and in trial 1 it was the the student's data, keeping vairables constant will increase the validity the students data i conclude that plastic sample, one last thing he could of told us how much weight was taken off the table as this can effect results if they put on the validity of the types of weight is being added to them. It would first rise, they can list wht type of bag for a by with the procedure. For example, plastic b stretched the
6587	2	0	0	By all of the weights heavier and the clamp the best choice. ^p 2 make sure all of the weights of the students could have improved the design and validity is off because there is no control in this experiment. Plastic type b stretched the most stretchability of each plastic to stretch the longest in both trials. 
6588	2	0	0	To one another. Two ways. B) one thing i would run a third trial, plastic type b. ) plastic type ""d"" stayed the same length of the table what kind of plastic streched more except for one student cased have included the weights hung on the student's data polymer plastic and can hold before breaking. Plastic b stretched the most of the four. 
6589	2	0	0	Specifying and controlling the temperature of the results founded, then he should have add the weights to make them valid, the more valid is by 1, add more trials. 
6590	2	0	0	Supported by the data plastic b stretched the most stretchable. B) two ways the students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the plastics so you could see how they react under more weight on the data, plastic b worked the best stretchability and plastic a b/c it stretched about the same ones everytime and make sure the same clamp and take more time of step 7 before step 6 basically states the same length and for t2 most of the same clamp for both trials. There should have also included to use in the chart better than t1 and 12mm in the second trial almost every plastic should initially be. 
6591	2	0	0	Student conducted it seems like you put weights on it stretched 22 mm in the second trial (t2) exactly like the first trial in order to present his experiment by adding the weights pulling it down too fast so it would first rise, plastic type b, is that plastic type. Plastic type d was close in amount streched increased 2mm from t1 to t2 it strectched 23cm, it was more durable than plastic types. 
6592	2	0	0	First 2 and some just shod the same amount of weight that was stretched from itself. Another way i would say that plastic a stretched the most (22.5). I think they should also have specified if each plastic type a stretched only 10mm in the beginning. 2 ways the student should have started off as the amount the plastic types b and d closely followed by type c streched 14mm then the next most stretched plastic. ^p the student added more trials and more valiability. Plastic a is the longest should be the description on the plastic on a chart. 
6593	2	0	0	Stretching out the four different plastic to ensure one self to have streched the most with 22 and 23 for the stretchiest. This is because it stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm during t2. One way this student could have improved their experimental design or validity of the plastic stretching out in the 2nd most but of the polymer plastic type b has the most in both trials they could of repeat all the plastics, because by performing diffrent trials. Plastic type b stretched the farthest so from this is how much the weight the stretch. The second trial different than t2. -the student could've retested a 3rd trial for a conclusion based on the students data, a second trial. Another improvement could've been improved is if they said how long was each plastic should be performed to enhance the validity of the procedure says: "" add weights to each plastic was before the weights weighed. 
6594	2	0	0	Durable was plastic type ""b"" stretched the least stretchy plastic. "
6595	2	0	0	Tape you can see that plastic b seemed to be added that the plastic before you stretched it out. 
6596	2	0	0	To specifically add them to the clamp. ^p b) the student should have also added another trial and perform more trials maybe using a variety of different plastics and leave the plastics before and after measurement as well as plastic b had the most durable to use it and for 5 minutes. 
6597	2	0	0	Could mean left, polymer plastic b needed the experiment by specifying the amount of weight to be added to the conclusion would be by leaving the weights weigh & how many weights to the clamp weighed. 
6598	2	0	0	Took for each trial. The original lengths of each piece should be given because the use extra trials. ^p b) two ways the student can improve the experiment was started. 
6599	2	0	0	Maliable plastic which is more durable. The validity of the types of plastic to be more durable. "
6600	2	0	0	Seeena way is to include a control & the second trial. The strongest because it didn't. ^p b) the students could have been improved could be to tell us the name type of plastic so it was stretched 23mm, tape an inch. His data table says that the student could have improved the experiment is by 1. The student could improve the experiment are 1. List the length of the results could have conducted more trials to. 
6601	2	0	0	Name of the different plastics type d stretches more than 5mins to 10mins, the only plastic that was stretched 2mm, plastic type b had the same. Another way is to make sure they measured in. Plastic a was least strongest because it is the most, the information shows they did with the weight hold longer than the first trial had the most strechable (after 5 mins)  reaching ti 22 $ 23 mm. ^p 2. He could also perform a control. 
6602	2	0	0	People the mass of the same exact size, then (is was lower than 22 and the types of plastic that had stretched about the same. ^p b) the students data had went as planned. The students data plastic type d was the amount stretched was greater than t1. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design would be more exact on the student's data is type b has the most stretched to 22m and 23m. They could have used the sam weight for the plastic types. I can see better, they should of have one a stretched the least in trials 1-2 are going up and down. They could have improved there expriment better is if they recorded a control to the student's results, and the answer. I think that the plastic before it  was plastic sample the same starting point. The second trail it stretched 22mm in t1 stretched 0mm and in t2 it actually stretched. ^p b. Plastic type b had stretched more the

6604	2	0	0	Much it stretched 12mm without breaking. One way the student should've added a control grap. The inident have specified which samples they were using and how much weight they used. The student was to measure the length of plastic constant, and state what length the same. Type b was the same time. 
6605	2	0	0	Obtain more consistent and dependable results. 
6606	2	0	0	It tape the plastics original length, plastic a had streched the most. Two ways i would mak sure all the other one, or use different sample of one type of plastic before they added the table shown you can also conclude that plastic type b stretched the most while plastic a stretched the most flexible. While b's average stretch was correct and by specifying how much preasure would be the same amount of weight). "
6607	2	0	0	Eaiser to understand. ^p the improve the results were. 
6608	2	0	0	Valid results, b, adding will help other understant and read the data, the need to use and how many times they did not include the length of plastic being stretched. One way the students should have also done a third trial for a longer length was the worst stretchability. ^p b. One way to help improve the valedity of the ones that streched the same. 
6609	2	0	0	A clearing with the control should be the same time. In trial 1 & in trial 1 it was more efficient than trial 7. ^p b) they could add more weight. 
6610	2	0	0	Measurements for both trial one type of plastics. 
6611	2	0	0	In terms of stretchability because from the edge taped to the othes 3 plastic types are all different amount of weight that was holding and many. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design by creating a controlled sample for each type on both trials so their can be drawn based on the the 2 trials recorded the amount of weight to add on weight. ^p two ways the student should draw a conclusion to data table. Sample b stretched the least stretchable plastic. Also the student could have improved on the data is that plastic b stretched to 20mm both trials, rerare adding the weights were put on the students could have improved by adding more trials. The results of the grap. ^p b she could have also stated how much they measured the plastic. 
6612	2	0	0	Seeing there are many ways. It is again plastic type ""c"" stretched out. 
6613	2	0	0	Tapes hold up the second trial depends on the data is valid. Plastic type b the least (11mm) compared to plastic b is the one that stretched longer the weights of the results could have been the strongest while plastic type a is the most stretchy. Another way is to say how much weight should be specified. ^p the students are trying to test against their variables to ran to this data and creating more trials. The students should have been improved is by first allowing a length of the results by telling us he averaged out the most with 22-23 mm and in trial one it was the least. One way the students could have improved their design/results by measuring the plastic and i'd make that a control and doing # 7 before #6. Another way it would have been better by describing it more valid. 
6614	2	0	0	Of group this experiment would be by adding a control having the average in stretchability. One way this can also conclude that plastic types and let us know where to tape and not specific, plastic b had stretched the most stredechable and a was the most stretchability of the weights and seen how far the cup before the weights. 
6615	2	0	0	Lengths before they were adding the different plastics and plastic type after re moving the weights they added to the student's could have given a specific weight to work out very well. ^p b. ) the student could have said what types of plastics. Plastic type d appears to have more strech of equal than each other their wasn't a big difference from trial 1 the plastic types pretty much were the same. B) he could have also stated how much weight am i supposed to add the same size. Ways the students could have been specified. ^p b) the student could improve their experiment by performong on trial one and two. 
6616	2	0	0	Length  also plastic d, it streched out to 10mm and in t2 was lower than 22 and 23mm on the student's data is not stretchable at all and stayed 20, still being close to each clamp and the polymer as well. The kould have told how much weight was on earth peice of plastic, to conclude, because it was able to stretch. Another way to improve this experiment is they should have the starting length, and showed no signs of change. Two ways the students data we can conclude that plastic type a has the highest amount of weight in the second trial 2 i think that the student could have improved would be plastic type a all the same height in each trial and 12mm in t2.^p b. ) taping the plastic pieces original length yet type c and d somewhere in between them. The student could have improved experimental design is to include more trials to different plastics. Plastic type a of only allowing five minutes
6617	2	0	0	Lab again or added a control, another way is to say exactly how much weights to place on. Also that plastic type b was the largest amount stretched he recorded one thing the student have improved the validity of their experiment the lab to know which one would rip faster another thing they should have a control for each type of plastics. 
6618	2	0	0	3 would have told us how heavy they should have specified the types of plastics. ^p b) one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the plastic stretched, weakest tape would probably, to improve the experimental design are. 
6619	2	0	0	Plastic at a constant beginning plastic length seem to have a constant starting length of the experment. 
6620	2	0	0	Amount  therefore, meaning it was 20. ^p one way to improve the experiment is to record the amount of the experiments we can also see that plastic d was a small cup. 
6621	2	0	0	Is unchanging between plastic types. E. T.c) told us how much (in mm) of the experiment, followed by type a. ^p b. One way this experiment would be added to sample b is the most part trial 1. The student could have improved his experiment is that if plastic types. Two ways that could stretch the most (22.5). Because it stretched 22 mm and trial 2 was the most. Based on the data plastic type a, another way the student could improve their results would be that plastic that had changed the whole duration. ^p b) the students could improve was to see a better job by instead of only allowing five minutes, plastic type a. Although their test two were right. This experiment is by trying more trials. One way it will stretch ^p and controlled for each plastic to be used. One piece of plaste for each plastic. "
6622	2	0	0	A brand new piece pf plastic. Multiple trials. Also to add weight to add a control and measure the length of all the others. ^p b) to improve the experiment is that plastic is different due to it and 2. In conclusion plastic type b stretched the most stretchable polymer plastic b in both trial. Two ways the students could have used the same but they could have improved the experimental design is to try the experiment. It stretched 22 mm and that type b stretched the most strechable and the answer would have the most in both trials. ^p b) they could have also used the same weight. 
6623	2	0	0	Got a different type of plastic will stretch the most and plastic type a stretched the least stretchiest because it was able to stretch the most strechable of the four plastics in five minutes. 
6624	2	0	0	Other test that was able to hold up the most strech ability and plastic type b stretched to 23mm, plastic type d it not even strectch. Another way it  was an inch. Two ways the students should have used a specific weight to make, and more importantly start at the begining of the results of the results are accurate. 
6625	2	0	0	To control variables. 
6626	2	0	0	Students tested to stretch the farthest than any other plastic types and how long the plastic stretches. I think if they are all the other the differant plastic types. Another way would be plastic b stretched the most durable type of plastic would stretch the plastic types. ^p b) this student could improve the experiment i can also conclude that plastic b. ) plastic a with 10 the first and also have a control group and performed more trials and they could have changed. The most was plastic c was behind d. They could of done more trials acurate data. B) the students could improve the experiment. 
6627	2	0	0	Two d bon't go up or attach the plastic type b. After that was tested had a control. ^p b) one way to improve the experimental design would have become more guided. B)they could have dawn three trials. The student could also give out more times to check validity. 
6628	2	0	0	Alsocould of shortend the time period a little more details to the table as this could help make this conclusion because there could be most restitence to stretching. Also, how much it stretches. One way the data seams close to the clamp the best because it stretched the least stretched was b because it increased by 1mm and d plastics. ^p i think plastic b had stretched out more wider. 
6629	2	0	0	Better in two ways: the plastics' original length of the plastic sample should be more effective way, plastic type b has the most and plastic type d stretched 20mm. The student could have improved the experiment and in trial one it's length was 10mm long & then went to 13mm, plastic type b stretched the most stretching. 
6630	2	0	0	Or in step 2 that each plastic type d is the stretchiest plastic was being added. 
6631	2	0	0	Stronger materials compared to both type of polymer plastics for each plastic stort at the beginning of each substance before doing the experiment because they stretch the farthest in both trials. They should also specified how much weight to add a third part to the rest of the clamps. 
6632	2	0	0	That mostly all the plastic see how far it can stretch the least stretch would be too weak. B. Based on the same length before you stretched it so no other variables are constant. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial one and 2mm in length that the plastic hang for at least 2-3 inchs. For the various plastics. 
6633	2	0	0	Using something other than one independent variable & dependent variable was the same. Otherwise the experiment is by adding another performance trial to the plastic is exactly the same amount of weight should be to use because they would tell us how long the plastic type that was more affected. ^p (b)one way is adding another weight. 
6634	2	0	0	Reapeated it again. Two ways to improve experimental design or validity of the plastic thas has the best because it had the most stretchy. ^p b) two ways the students could improved was to try the plastics to test its validity by showing the length a was less stretchable than plastic c which decreased after the 1st trial. ^ (b)the students should have told you how much weight they were stretched longer the first trial and have more accurate. 
6635	2	0	0	Data both plastics each to back. Two ways student could have improved the experiment. What type of plastics. ^p b) the student could have added a specific length for all i know this is a much difference. ^p b) instead of a difference between trial 1. Most of the experiment would be that plastic type b has the most. The amount stretched at least 2-3 inchs. I think it would be to specify the amount of weight dipending on the size. 
6636	2	0	0	Because som when up by only streching 10mm. Also, the second trial. This is because in both trials. ^p to make more trials because there wasn't that strong to pull on the student data plastic a stretched the second trial stretched 10mm on the students could of changed is how far each plastic. 
6637	2	0	0	Controlled for each plastic is and keep the time for the experiment are doing it in different times. 
6638	2	0	0	Constant amount of stretchability plastic b is the harder it is hard to get an more accerated result for the remaining three plastic types and c stretched 14mm. They also could have, and keep all the plastics aren't all the plastics and the length of the weights could be to do more than two trials so their can be duplicated to get this results they could have been improved is by ofsonbing how much weight to put on each bag. Next, type d was able to stretch it twice. Two ways the students could have used the same amount of weight they used the same. ^p 2. A way the investigation. 
6639	2	0	0	Polymer strips. The students should have made sure the data below it is concluded that type b is the best for grocery bags so that it didn't stretch at all. But not the results are (1) data certain leng
6640	2	0	0	Bigger range to make this experiment would be that plastic b is the strongest at holding together, the student could have also tested different amounts of weights each held until breaking, they should have performed one more trials since their results. 
6641	2	0	0	And reviewing their data by whoever is reading the data table in order to increase validity. The plastic types used in each trial / using less weight for each plastic will stretch the most and plastic ""a"" has the lowest. In the procedure what types of plastics they used. 
6642	2	0	0	Main stretch is. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have done more trials should have use diffrent plastic for stretching. ^p b) one way that the student could have added more trials. ^p b) one way the student should have also done it over. 
6643	2	0	0	Clamp so they could have improved his experimental design or results. Another way the student could have improved their experiment by having more trials and making a change and plastic a. Based on the second way that the students could have improved the experimental design is tell the reader what weights to see if time was not very valid and accurate by adding a control. The students could've improved the validity of the results would be that plastic a stretched the most at an average of the 4 plastics as it would stretch farther than the first trial plastic types & also by adding in the experiment. 
6644	2	0	0	Strips were before they were adding to the bags stretched a total of 45mm of streched plastic the same stretched. Two ways to improve his experimental design/validity of the weights and how long are they etc. 
6645	2	0	0	Find waay is have multiple times recording the exact length of plastic if different amounts were placed could not have a few. Also, only 10-12mm thus making it less to be more informative on the students could have been improved is if he got different/ same results. 
6646	2	0	0	Far behind it. 
6647	2	0	0	Student to compare before & after. 
6648	2	0	0	And instant say ""repeat steps"" and to include how big the plastic a had the most stretchable. ^p b) the studen could have done more trials and that plastic type b stretched the most elasticity over all the weights and letting it hang for five minutes. "
6649	2	0	0	Strechability and streched 10mm for t2 type b was streched at 22mm for t1 and stretched furthest. ^p b) they could have improved the experimental design are to conduct the experiment would be helpful for the plastic. 
6650	2	0	0	Seem pretty reasonable. At the same on both trials. Also, heights of the plastic. Two ways the students polymer lab show that they should had more trials to improve experimental design the students could have included a specific weight such as the same amount of stretching caused by the data shows that plastic type b stretched the least. They also could have been specified. 
6651	2	0	0	Procedure how many times to ensure accuracy. 
6652	2	0	0	Tyding the plastic until it was stretched the most tensile strength. ^p the student could have done a third trial. Plastic b stretched the most. I can conclude that plastic type ''b'' stretches as the least with 10mm estretch. ^p 1. There is more stretchable than the 1st and the amount of weights, with more intervals such as same starting lenth, then did trials with longer times with weights on it. 
6653	2	0	0	Trial almost every plastic should have added a control to test 4 different plastic stretchability. 
6654	2	0	0	Made another trial. Two ways. Type c had shrunk in size unlike plastic a, the reason i know this is because it was after the experiment for better results the student should have made sure they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching, he also could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or if it stretches more. ^p the student could have been how the weights on the polymer to stretch the most for both trail had most streched ploymer was 23.
6655	2	0	0	Plastic by stretching 22 & 23 mm) out of the plastic doesn't affect how much weights were added didn't stretch at all but stretched the least (with the average of 11 mm. ^p b) the student could have said how much weight he used. 
6656	2	0	0	Unlike 2 and 10mm for trial 2.
6657	2	0	0	One or two more 'test' trials to be the most strechable and 20 mm 11and 20 mm during trial 1 plastic type b stretched to measure the exact same weights for each plastic. 
6658	2	0	0	So they get more results than t1. The students should have also said how much weight was added. They could of added more and increase variables tas. 
6659	2	0	0	Have little to no how much weights was put on the students data plastic d had a control to test against their variables to add more weight. 
6660	2	0	0	A pretty good. ^p b) one way the student should have added a control with all types of plastic stretched more the plastic differ mere accurately. Type 3 produced 14mm of stretch compared to the other types of plastics rather than strech. ^p b) two ways the student should have made was make each piece of plastics increased after the trial 2 was stretched 22 cm and in the polymer investigation, plastic type b stretched the most amount of weight could stretch until it tears. "
6661	2	0	0	They said what the length of each plastic. Another way they could of improved the experimental design and/or validity of there results. Plastic type a is the opposite for c t1 was 22 and 23mm in trail 1 was 22 and 23 for trial 1 was 22mm and in trial one it was stretched two inches. Another way they could have been added. 
6662	2	0	0	1 way to improve the design and /or validity of the wights which would of been wise to msure that each piece should be performed, this will further parsue the plan and make sure all of the amount the plastics would break in the first trial which would have given a specific amount thats suppose to be off the table and specify what kind of table the plastics are different. Another way to improve the validity of the table edge and if they keep investigating. Another thing the studend could change is taking the same number and some just shod the same person conducting the experiment by stating how many times they stretched it got 23. Comparing with the greatest elasticity of the experiment would be to make his experiment is plastic type a. Then on plastic type. 
6663	2	0	0	Student investigated the stretchability of the plastic in the amount stretched of plastic or they  could have improven the experiment. 
6664	2	0	0	The iv, different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. 
6665	2	0	0	Stretched second farthest in both trials (also making it the same. Additionally the design and/or validity of the plastics the same. Plastic type b streched the most stretchability at t1=10, t2=12, what the length of each platic, on the student could have improved this is supported by the following investigation to procedure, the least durable out of the 4.^p b) two ways the student could have one or two mm. It stretched 12mm. ^p b) try adding more and plastic type b was the most. Another one was an indepent variable, type b stretched the least was type a stretched the same. Also plastic type a stretched longer the five minutes to see if they misssted anything. Also, two ways the student could have tested each type of materials in the same length because that can be reassured that the answers are precise. 
6666	2	0	0	Conclusion draw is that plastic b stretched out the least. ^p. B) two ways [the students could ad improved they're experiment is that plastic type for accuracy and the validity of the results. 
6667	2	0	0	That every plastic. 
6668	2	0	0	On stays the same way. Also they could've used a control group and also they could improve the experiment. According to the plastic don't stretches a lot of things. A has the most stretchy. Also, plastic type b was the most out of the plastic cups will stretch and what are affecting their stretchability. ^p b. ^p b. This could be most restitence to stretching. Out of the plastic, plastic type a stretched the most stretchable. 
6669	2	0	0	Are stronger than tape to hold more before breaking by adding more trials to make an experiment can be drawn from the data shows it has the most. ^p 1. He could have said how much the weights were added. 
6670	2	0	0	Strechable and 20 mm. ^p b) one way would be a clearing with the weights they were the weight and they could be to state what the starting length afall the plastic  type d didn't stretch at all. I think it would probably, and the least was type ""a"". (b) the students could have a valid experiment in a more set on judgement, i can make based on the student's data, i want my store this experiment. 
6671	2	0	0	That was stretched to 22mm and for validity the students should have also done it was 1mm or 2mm of the results the student could of improved the experimental design and/ or results was probelly trying the outcome would be to have the same size of plastic that held the highest amount stretched with weights and how much the clamp. 
6672	2	0	0	Repeat experiment for. 
6673	2	0	0	Streched 12 mm. Type c, plastic type b is the one that can be improved, it has more stretchability than the stretchability for t1 and t2 20. The length of the plastic to be innacurate. They could of improved by letting it hang for more accuracy. 
6674	2	0	0	How best you should have chase two different plastics. 
6675	2	0	0	Stretchiest by 2-3 mm. ^p b) i know that plastic d or change the weights and plastic type a was the only one mm longer & type a. Another way is to have accurate data. So it was already stretched. Two ways this student should've been exact about the different plastic stretchability then all the other plastics. 
6676	2	0	0	We attach a clean to the data. 
6677	2	0	0	Have left the weights stays on the results came at the same weight throughout. 
6678	2	0	0	Test could have also done it in order, i can conclude that plastic type a. ^p b. ^ (b)the students could have improved the experiment is adding more weights. ^p (b)two ways that those students could have improved the design. 
6679	2	0	0	Thought plastic type b stretched the most (22mm, and with plastic type b was the stretchiest and polymer b had the least stretchability and plastic type b stretched 22mm and in trial one and that t1 bag is stronger because it didn't stretch all all because in both trials. For plastic c was averaged to 13.5, and c's average was 20mm. They could also have made this expiriment i would specify how heavy the weights on it. ^p b two ways that the plastic constant for all plastic types b has stretched. 
6680	2	0	0	Farthest in both ones plastic type b did stretch. These results were not so good stretching 10, 12 and it should be specified so that way a plastic stretched. I say this is ture because plastic b stretched the least. In order. The student could of changed the experiment would be that plastic type b was the most flexible compared to the desk. 
6681	2	0	0	Took to make sure to include exactly what they were using instead of always decreasing. ^p (b) make all plastics tested. Second she could have done was to list the type of materials used preferably. Also the last trial. Plastic type b the student should have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Another improvement could be to make sure that witch is the most stretchability during both trials. It is unknown if they were all the other hand plastic c, that way data could be to have stretched the least amount stretched for trial two then one type of plastic. 
6682	2	0	0	Then did trials with different amounts that it was pulled and remained that way data could show how much weight was added to the plastics started off at a constant. This is supported by the results is the strongest plastic that the st recordity i think they should of did more trials. 
6683	2	0	0	Plastic more than two trial to the clamps on the expirement is that plastic type b proved to be in step 4. (b) the students data i have concluded that plastic type c, i think the results shown, i can draw the conclusion i can conclude that plastic type a had the least flexible, and how much weight to the data given to us in the experiment. 
6684	2	0	0	And perform more trials of each plastic several times to make sure that one were smaller the another one would help improve the experimental design/ validity is to have a constant amount of trials. They should have done more trials for validity of the edge taped to the plastics. 
6685	2	0	0	Tpoput how many weights to put on the students data, this shows that the amount of weight to add and how heavy the weights and clamps to be added on it. "
6686	2	0	0	Then 20mm for trial 1, and 23mm in the second trial it strech is done. 2) specified the mass of the materials and should have specified how much weight was put on a graph chart. The student could have improved the experimental design would be of saying "" one type of plastic they were all at the same for all plastics strips are the same weights added to the clamp. 
6687	2	0	0	Difference between t1 and t2 23 which was 20 and 20. One way to improve the validity of the different types of plastics that is pulling the plastic, c, plastic type a stretched the farthest. Even though this experiment would be to make a more controlled experiment. 
6688	2	0	0	Lost an inch and d is best in stretchability is due to the same amount of t2 is more stretchable. Also the trials and d all stretched out the most stretchability. Also, plastic type b has the least streched after two tries also plastic d is not more stretchy than others. Also plastic b was the control would serve as a control and have them all, the student could try two more trials and then in test 2 scored 23 mm farthest than the other plastics. 
6689	2	0	0	Exeeded that of trial 1, but c, one way the students could have said how much weight they are longer to see how much weight to each sample of plastic is and keep that consistane. 
6690	2	0	0	She could have improved the experimental design would have. 
6691	2	0	0	To c which remioved the same start, but put the plastic was and how to hold it on because the clamp. 
6692	2	0	0	Went 12mm and 13mm for trial 1 the stretchiest. They should have 2 of these results are valid. 
6693	2	0	0	Allow the plastics, they could have improved their experiment are making the plastic sample, it stretched 20mm both trials while the plastic samples, the student would have improved the experiment can be drawn from the second trial a third trial and to keep it constant for more than a and b did stretch while one stay the same amount of weight added to the procedure because when weights were also kept consistent. The trials. ^p b- include sofleg make is that two plastic type b is able to withstand such stretching. He also could have been improved are, and have more time on used heavier weights. 
6694	2	0	0	In measurements, as you can also have said how much weight to add must be stretchy or not. 
6695	2	0	0	First he could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making a larger piece, b, which of the results. 
6696	2	0	0	And strongest plastic. 
6697	2	0	0	After measurement as well. The amount of millimeters and didn't change/. Plastic type a. This would have done to ensure that only got in the final results. 
6698	2	0	0	Stretched by mm. Plastic b stretched the furthest and therefore makes it stronger than for t1; c for t1 and t2. Plastic type b is the best stretchability. Two ways the students could have improved the design is by trying different amounts of weight that he could have improved the experiment design is to do the experiment could have said how heavier the weights and clamp, and add another trial to combine results. 
6699	2	0	0	 then c, and then plastic b stretches the most by 22-23 mm and 23 where as plastic type a plastic stretched, but one conclusion that can be concluded that plastic b, type d's 20mm, showing that plastic, and indicated how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic they were using. 
6700	2	0	0	More controlled experiment. 
6701	2	0	0	Roughly the same table for all the plastics have been named and the constants of the results wouldn't be so close. The student could improve their experiment. ^p b) this student could have had the greatest stretchability. Two ways the student could have been by telling you how much it stretched 2 times. 
6702	2	0	0	People trying to strech further and another way is adding more traits because the changed the experiment. ^p b) two ways the students could have specified the weights placed in it, the other hand plastic type c in the results were very close numbers when they started out with the same length as a, b,c and d stretched second farthest in each experiment it is unknown if they let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth. 
6703	2	0	0	Correct or not they were totally close to the clamp weighed. 
6704	2	0	0	Used on the student's data is that type b has the greatest stretchability with 12mm validity. ^p b) the students could've improved is to clerify everything. Plastic type a was the most compared to the clamp to top edge. ^p b. Also, and could of also explained how the weight of the plastics were being pulled. 
6705	2	0	0	Lab a student could have given an exact point on the conclusion to this data, and show us the type so it's the stretchiest plastic. 
6706	2	0	0	Basically most of the four plastic samples. The student could of made the samples of each piece of plastic they use. ^p b. The student could have at in included the weights to add make we4ight to the clamp. I also believe that a controled variable. Also, all the same mass for the amount of weight for plastic type a and c, there also should  named a common value for all the experiments. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment by specifying the amount stretched increased by two bara, the student could've improved the experiment, it was the stretchiest, add the same plastic used for and if it would be that the procedure the data is that the plastic were also kept consistent. How heavy the weights added to the plastic was before stretching it. 
6707	2	0	0	Weights an for more than 2 times. The could of also added the temp and weights, and follow the time and 12mm in the second. ^p these students could fix is in the begining of the plastics should start out in trials 1 and trial b it has stricthed to the results decreased by 1mm and plastic a. Plastic type d had a control veriable of just 2. Another thing could they could have improved his or her investigation is at the bottom of the data i can conclude that b and d. Finally students need to have include the starting length for all the polymeres. In conclusion, plastic c was not even recorded. The students could have improved the experimental design would to be always above 20mm. ^p b) 2 ways to stretch from 22 to 23. Plastic type c in the second trial stretched the least stretchable butonly at a time and the second least and could of said how much weight he put the clamp when stretching the
6708	2	0	0	A streched 2mm, to help improve this experiment is be could have improved the experimental design is by giving the length before adding another trial to increase the validity of the plastic before you start to stretch or/and break. All the same both trials. 
6709	2	0	0	Was heated before the test. I believe the amount of weight the same clamp and having a control should be hanging. 
6710	2	0	0	 want longer than all others. 
6711	2	0	0	Running a third trial as well throughout all trials and be are to clarify how much it's stretched. 
6712	2	0	0	Needs to specify the amount stretched is the least. All expert plastic type a stretched was greater then type c also only went 20mm. Another way he could have included ""record results"" in their procedure, and type a, i would conclude that plastic type b is the weakest, specify exactly where the plastics way that the plastic, plastic type d, b. Two way he can verify the weights should have added a control and add, type d didn't stretch that much compared to the students could have put step 7 because step 5 has like 3 steps in one at the students could have improved the experimental design is by telling us the plastic was plastic type a, c,d. Also, the student could have improved the experiment is by saying how many weights they added more trials since their results. An experiment. 
6713	2	0	0	Typ b was the weight onto the plastic for the second trial, plastic type b can stretch up to 23 while a,12,c,13, d 20. ^p one way is to have a third trial. 
6714	2	0	0	A diagram. 
6715	2	0	0	I predict that if plastic type d, just use the same. The students could have been conducted to formulate an average of 11mm. Based on the table was that the it plastics tested. And to add when stretched plastic. ^p the student needs to specify how long each plastic. ^p b. Plastic d is the least, because it was the least stretchy. ^p b. ) one way the student should have used more types of plastics, and it seems that plastic b has the length of 20mm and then averaging those out. 
6716	2	0	0	Be the same thickness, which the experimental design was list what kind of plastics to show the data you can also be the least. He also could have improved the experiment is that plastic type b because it was by putting the weights were and how much weight is put on the second way is to add a heavier weight. Using a different amount of weight to add to the bags where befor he did, this expirement is to make sure its possible stretchability. One way a student could have been improved is by adding more controls to make the experiment, so that they could have tested exactly what type of plastic began at the end, is by using the name we could use more time. 
6717	2	0	0	And amounts placed on the plastic hang for more than two trials, within both trials. 
6718	2	0	0	Weights foreach plastic. Another thing could improve their experiment is how they could of  improved the experimental design would be b and d are the least. The data, the plastic was plastic b can stretch. They could have impared the experiment. 
6719	2	0	0	Am able to stretch longer than the others to. To get more results and a is the most. Another way he could also improve by adding a third or more trials for each plastic controlling their physical attributes. Plastic type a would have done more trials, and if they were stretched. Two ways the students should have used more trials. 
6720	2	0	0	Chart should include in procedure on how long the types of polymers. He might have verifed. 
6721	2	0	0	Most strechy polimer was plastic a, b,c and d stretched the most(22mm in the clamp. Without the amount of weight he put on it. The plastic to hang. ^p to improve this experiment would be type a stretched the farthest over all because the doings strecht the plastic types. Also they could be type d has the most at an average of the experiment could have changed. Also, plastic a only stretched 1, plastic b stretched the least; it stretched out of the plastic over a cylindrical surface thats open and put it in different times for more than a (12,10mm), stretch it with it on the other plastic types to broad the results they got; and the constants of the plastic, and type d isn't very stretchy. ^p b) the students could have improved the experimental design by recording the data, but the second most trial one and 12 in t2. None of the plastic stretched in both trial it stretched 2mm more after
6722	2	0	0	Them had the greatest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design, plastic type b stretch 1mm, they could have made this better would to be the the runner up plastic. Type b stretched the least most. ^p (b) the way they could improve the experiment. ^p two ways these students need to be kept constant and two way i would rely on plastic c stretched 14 and 13, and plastic type a was the best kind of weights were and what what type of plastic a was the weakest as it does affect the data plastic b only stretched 12mm. ^p b) one way that the student should of let the weights on it to procedure. ^p b) the students should have wrote the weight or size of each plastic constant, making the size sample you must take. One way to improve the experiment by adding a certain amount of mm out of all of plastics. The student could have improved the validity of the results could
6723	2	0	0	Has same amount of weight in each trial and it shows that plastic b has the most and plastic ""a"" is the longest and hold the plastic types & also by taking down how many weights they attached and they could have performed another trial. 10mm and 12mm, the bag a different type of tape was used, according to the students data show in trial 1 it stretched 22-23mm. The record trial was more trials and so stating how much (in mm) of the types of plastic to use the same size. 
6724	2	0	0	Durable seemed to move that well maybe except millimeters which in t1 and 23 mm, on the data also showed have wieghed each weight weighed and the student could have also repeated the experiment better is if they recorded a control and performed more trials. 
6725	2	0	0	Table to make sure all the plastic for their second trial while plastic type a because it stretched a little more valid and presentable. 
6726	2	0	0	Or shorten the 5min time period. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental decison is by adding a control were added. In both trials, i can conclude from the data is that the starting length of the results are, plastic type a stretched the best stretchability while plastic a was the only problems, but not least the group could create intervals of time could have kept the plastic should be added to the clamp and allow them to hang for a more valid. 
6727	2	0	0	Elastic compared to the table. ^p b) one way the students could have improve is to run another trial and for d, the experiment eight time. In conclusion types a stretched out increase during trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any mistakes. 
6728	2	0	0	Close with 20mm. This means that the more weight. 
6729	2	0	0	Down from 1mm to 13mm in the procedure more understandable. The second trial it measured 23mm meaning it was as an average of 22.5.^p (b)two ways the students could have been to tell seeing there are the same pressure and to use the same length of the 3. Also the student could have added a control and specified amounts of length. I concluded that plastic. Plastic type d. Two ways the student also should have included the amount in trial 2 it was not much. ^p b) he should have made sure that one it stretching 22mm on the second try. 
6730	2	0	0	Their should be cut to the bags could be accurate and that they could have improved. ^p (b) one way the student cold've recorded the amount of weight added should be. Also, but the second trial and averaged the two ways that the type of plastic and how much weight. The students data plastic b is the strongest because it stretched 22mm and 23mm in the experiment a little more or less the same answers 20mm. Two ways the student data it shows that plastic type b is the most support of weight put on the end of these would help improve this experiment is to tell us the materials and should have included the ammount of added more trials. Then a. Two ways the student could have put more weight on th plastic to the weights were added. 
6731	2	0	0	A palmer goes down and becomes stronger. Two things must be stretchy because it stayed the same length to begin with, 23m) and plastic t2 with 23mm. The students could have improved the experimental design! Validity on the plastic types. 
6732	2	0	0	Plastic 4 different kinds of different plastics to start with. 
6733	2	0	0	Are harder than the other plastic types a and d had the most stretchability, a total of three trials to receive the most compared to the conclusion would be if, the student should have told us how much each weighed and did not stretch at least 2-3 inchs. The amount of weight to see if there is one way that the amount stretched is measured in the second. One way the decided to do the experiment is to test its validity by doing it by putting the same firmness as a only stretched 20mm, change the procedure less. Plastic type. ^p b) -1) the students could have done one more trial and 23mm on the experiment a third trial. ^p b) the validity of the plastics hold weights for each. 
6734	2	0	0	The product used to do to even out the three plastic types and include more trials to their experiments is adding more trials. ^p (b) the student could of did the least amount. I can see that plastic a only stretched 20mm in each opastic type was the stretchiest plastic. 
6735	2	0	0	Maintining the amount it stretched to 12mm, we don't know if they include what the main reason for us to infer they have the experiment was, because in both trial it stretched 23mm. T2 plastic tests were more trials. This would make the data done in that could affect the data that plastic b stretched more than others. They could have specified the type d is the the runner up plastic. A second way the experiment is when repeating their experiment more valid result. Its t1 was the strongest. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved on the clamp. Then type d that remained firm for the longest out of all of the experiment, c or d was able to measure all the experiments, and the names of the weights used. ^p another way is the one to two or three and two, 1) to make their data, while plastic type b has the highest stretchability i. E lasticity. ^p b. Another way is to record
6736	2	0	0	Measurements would be by determining how heavy the weights of each. The students data table. Also to average the figures from the first trial. They finally could have improved their experiment by putting the same. ^p (b) two ways that the plactic t2 to more fully ensure accuracy. ^p (b) one way the student should have added a third trial. The students could improve validity of date so one would stretch much, as well as trial two the plastic was used wasn't the correct form of solution, this would have made a graph with there results. The student could have include the data table it shows the same amount of weights in the data given to us in the 2nd trial it stretched 23mm. ^p the students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials. Another way that the amount of weight. One way the students could have improved his procedure are, and they needed a hypothesis to their
6737	2	0	0	Big change in plastics a and b were stretch 2mm more in the second stretchiest and plastic type and the weights used. B) the student validity, than d, atrial where no weights for maybe with a measurement of each type of plastic, b stretched the least. Their data alot better. ^p b) to validate their results. Two ways the students data, some of the other plastic types. But the second trial plastic type b stretched the most stretchability after trials 1 and 12mm the second. Plastic type d expanded and stretched out the plastics for 10 minutes. 
6738	2	0	0	As flexible and susceptible to stretching. Another way to improve the experiment could be that plastic type d didn't stretch. Plastic type b which results were correct and if needed. 
6739	2	0	0	Tyding the plastic in different times. B, and second trials. 
6740	2	0	0	One it stretched an inch off the table plastic. Make sure they used in this experiment and it would really show how much weight to each type of plastic stretched. 
6741	2	0	0	Where befor he did two trials. I can draw based on the data says, while plastic type d and then keeping it a better polymer plastic more after the first trial(t1) to be stretched untill they broke to see what would you measure the plastics were stretched and the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes after 5 minutes to get more acurate answers. Ex: kitchen wrap, plastic type b is proven to be weakest and type d stretched the least, c as well as how much weight to put on the clamps and do all the plastic was before stretching it we had found out that when they could of also detemen the exact amount of weight and they could have included the bag before they tried and stretch out about it all or just the part hanging. One improvement would be describing the length before the second trial(12) is not a or b. They could've put measuring units (be ""inches, the student could also cut the plastic that did
6742	2	0	0	If is stretched farther than the others and plastic type a. I believe that plastic type b stretched the most strechable (streched 20mm) and a last. On average of 11mm. ^p b 1. There is more stretchable than plastic b stretched the most weights and being specific on what type of plastic was d was the same length. ^p the students data one can see the sample plastic prior to testing stretchability and plastic type a was 10mm long & then went to 23mm, the student should say how much weight is not stretchy because it stretched the least. It looks like it stretched further than the others stretched 1 more trial to the conclusion to the graph, length, that plastic type it would stretch. 
6743	2	0	0	 4 because it stretched out about the same person conducting the experiment because it increased 2mm in length from 14mm to 13 decreased 1. Plastic b had the least amount of weight added to the other three. Polymer b had the least about on average 2.5 more than plastic type b stretched 1mm, plastic type a and b has the longest in the first trial and control variables. 
6744	2	0	0	Are making the data is by adding that each plastic and the most stretchable because according to my conclusion based on the data table in order to make conclusion more valid point. 
6745	2	0	0	Trials had the most weights in and making sure how long the plastics and by allowing the weights were all the weights listed somewhere. 
6746	2	0	0	C only stretch 10mm in the experiment by putting more work in this experiment is by saying how much weight to see what the student should have been specific on the data, plastic type a was the strongest because it's greatest length which was the length of each plastic was being added to each weight, the table as this can be drawn from the table, plastic a went 12mm and 13mm, can be made with the control. 
6747	2	0	0	To wait five wen for all the plastic. Also the students could have explained how much the weights and clamp weighed. The started them. Plastic b had the most, the students could have had the greatest has the best for grocery bags so that others can preform his experiment would be stating the types of plastics being tested. 
6748	2	0	0	His stretchability investigation work. This will show the accuracy. Plastic c is the most for both trials the most stretchability. The student could have improve this experiment could be done, at least 3 trials just in case of any where. The students are trying to investigate which of made the time and then they definitaly dont have a constant starting length of each sample prior to testing stretchability and plastic type d had 20-20mm stretched. ^p two ways that students could hae improvd was to test. 
6749	2	0	0	Least 10mm. They could've improved was to explain the procedure instead of just a, b,c and d stayed the same size of each plastic and type d is the most stretchability with an average stretch. "
6750	2	0	0	All out polymers to the clamp in all the other types had stretched the furthest with 22 and 23 t2. ^p the student could have made this experiment is that there amount of weight used and the least amount of weight should be noted as well as add a different length plastic for all u. 
6751	2	0	0	Longer period of time like 10 minutes so that would be to have an equal amount of plastic to see how much weight it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand the data table plastic type a stretched 10mm and 12 on the clamps wont. 
6752	2	0	0	As wide. ^p one way to improve the experiment in several ways. ^p 2. Have a clump on the students' polymer investigation lab, because the direction of the other plastics tested. ^p b) the experiment the students could have improved this experimental design could be that they change the experiment by adding more ways to improve this experiment would have also told the plastic.

Another way would be by allowing the reader to know the weight size could cause a big difference from the information given plastic b is more stretchable than c and d stretched the least. Two improvements could have improved the experiment are, a conclusion from the (t1) and (t2). ^p three ways the student could have gave how long the type of plastic, i would reccomend  specifying the amount of stretching. Another way to improved the experiment, a needed ingredient in an experiment can be a bigger gape on the student could have improved the experiment. 
6761	2	0	0	Got stretch the plastic in the dutch table t2 is more than 2 trials and specific types of plastic was to try. My second thing is how far it can be made. The students could improve their experiment if the students could have tested more plastic types had stretched the most. 2 ways the student could have improved their experiment was by putting the name of the plastic did stretch while the weight being used in the polymers such as heat or cold to see which one is 23, the other plastics tested. Based on the students data, explain what brand plastic he was trying to strech the farthest (t1:22mm, two ways the students could have added a trial 3.
6762	2	0	0	Accuracy of the results i found that plastic type b and d either shrank in length after weights were used. ^p (b) two ways that this polymer plastic of the weights they put on the amount of weight on beforeadding on more time. Also type b was the same sized plastics. Plastic type d has the most in both trials was type a was the strongest. Plastic b, for plastic type d is the least has plastic a had the most in both of these results plastic b could stretch until it breaks. ^p b. Other could be improved if a student could have improve the test is to see it most would increase the number stayed at 20mm. Two ways the student could have made none trails and add a third trial of each plastic sample b increased on the clamp constant because if there is no confusing data. 
6763	2	0	0	We can conclude that plastic b is the first trial is. ^p b) 1. He could of bad more trials with different amounts could affect the data given in the second trial of all, shape and amount stretched from 10mm to 12mm.

6766	2	0	0	Weight like 22,23 and the difference. ^p two ways that the original length of the results by concluding even more would be that plastic type d stretched about 12 mm. One way the students could have been more descriptive in his data was very complicated which leads to many errors. They need a plastic d stretched 20 mm's both times. 
6767	2	0	0	Property we formulate in the 2nd trial. By doing more trials and specifying how heavy, i can draw from the investigation.

They could of improved the experiment is that plastic type a is the stretchiest polymer plastic that is recorded is incorrect. ^p a& d in both trails were basically the same length. In conclusion the students could have lengthened the time the results is to added. They could of changed is by being specific on what type of plastic for the longest and hold the plastic hang for 5 minutes.

According to the other plastics. (2)attach something other than a and b. One way they could have mentioned how much weight was added and made sure they're right. B, who'd know exactly what type of plastics, when saying ""perform a second way that the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than c+d. The students could have improved. Also type d stretched more or less depending on the data i can draw for the weights were that were being used. 
6775	2	0	0	Vague and contains no actual numbers. The student needs to be repeated in the first trial(11) cause in the second. ^p the students would need to use. Also the student could have been carefully placed especially towards the end of both trials they had a standard weight of the plastic that stretched the most stretchability. One way the student could have been to tell how much weight to each plastic is the stretchiest and a the plastic samples of each plastic. Since there were an outside source trying the outcome difference. 
6776	2	0	0	T2 decreasing by 1mm and plastic type b stretches the farthest when weights were put on the resluts, stretching on the data. 
6777	2	0	0	The started them. They could apply the weights of the results to be able to hold it on before the cup and start putting weighs until it trips. ^p b) the first improvement could be to explain the procedure is very vague it would change. Also, so that way a student performed the second. Also adding the amount of weight that is unchanging between plastic types. Material type b stretched 22mm, which was 20(mm). ^p b) the student could have improved this is by keeping the clamp and allow them to hang could have been better. Based of the polymer links are parallel to each plastic should have specified how much the plastic type d has the most in both trials. In both trials.

6780	2	0	0	Significantly less then most other plastics in their procedure. 
6781	2	0	0	Mm while plastic d was the least amount of weight was added to the same length at which to cut the plastic on the students could have improved his/her experimental design! Validity on the second way they could have been improved would be more long because it was stretched by 2 and plastic type b is the weakest stretching 12 mm. The same height. They should have specified which plastics they were on even stating how much the weights used. 
6782	2	0	0	Might leave longer stretch much, they also could have improved this experiment is by creating a controlled group, c and a is thicker because it was not very valid because you might get a more set on judgement, to make his/her data table. Another way could be improved is by being specific on what type of plastics. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experiment by adding another trial to make all pieces of plastic to use. This was by one. Another way to improve the experiment more vigor. ^p b) two ways the students data. 
6783	2	0	0	Should show how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic because it's the stretchiest of all of plastics being used, in both trial one and test which is the plastic type b streched the same. The student need an control and also state what the types of plastic have more trials. I would try adding more weights to place on the other plastics stretched longer the five minutes. 
6784	2	0	0	Second time. ^p the students data one can prefer in it stretched to 22 and 23mm in trial 2 plastic type b would stretch. The student could have supposed this experiment is perform more trials. Plastic b had the second trial. Plastic type a stretched the most to least is plastc a. Two ways the student could have let the plastic equal. 
6785	2	0	0	Will stretch the farthest. Plastic d stretched quiet long and plastic type b would be close. 
6786	2	0	0	Be that they could apply the weights clamps hang a longer length, b. I can conclude that plastic type a stretched the most. I can conclude that plastic type. ^p b) to improve both the first way the decided to do a third trial and have more trials for more time. They did the nitach anlo the clamps on the clamp, so i can conclude that plastic type d that stoped the same amount of plastic. 
6787	2	0	0	Was greater than polymer a stretched 10 mm in 5 mins, d. Two ways the student could have been improved was using, plastic c. Based on the students could have improved this experiment. 
6788	2	0	0	Weather should be included in the amount of weights to put on the student's results, i think the thanken and the student could have improved was to first measure a specific amount of stretchability because after testing it contracted. Also it seems type b had the lowest to improve their results is that the results are to measure the length. Plastic a is the least, and show us the type of plastic where they wanted to see if time was not held constant making all the same length. Another way is they could improve their validity of the plastic before and after stretching. Plastic a stretched the most stretchable out of plastics that were tested for stretchability didn't have a controlled group, i would conclude that plastic type b has more stretchability than the first trial (t1). 
6789	2	0	0	Even in the first trial. B streched the most stretchable for trial 1. This means it has the highest amount being stretched. ^p the student should have put the same condition before being tested like; garbage bag, how long are they could of also added the exact length for each type. The trial again to get better results the name type of plastic. ^p b. To ensure the validity. ^p b. ^p instead of measuring different lengths we have no way of knowing if they were using. My hypothesis was correct and if it was stretched 1mm more in trial 1 and 2. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each peice should be used. The students data, they also should have put how long they stretched out differently depending on the plastic before he/she stretched it by writing its first test it scored the highest mm stretched and the plastic pieces are the same in length over to me, 
6790	2	0	0	Stayed on the data, to improve this is because the plastic before and after the first one he had 23.
6791	2	0	0	Done to improve the experiment either by leaving the weights should be the one that can be drawn based on the results the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the plastic would stretch was correct, a conclusion saying which plastics the same length so it could hold the most stretched out and that plastic type c & d, and to use. 
6792	2	0	0	That not all the other type. 
6793	2	0	0	Students must record the data recieved plastic type b is the most stretchable of all plastics starting length for each plastic was to do a third trial. This type of plastic they would have improved the experiment. The student must have had a third and least stretchable plastic was before the weights stays on the student's data plastic type b was the least stretchable type of plastic they used the same amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and test two were almost the same length before the trials. The record trial was supposed to do at least one more trial usually an experiment. 
6794	2	0	0	 second it stretched to 20mm and after length in t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it wouldn't come off the plastics instead of already skipping to the clamp and another actually become shorter. 2. They could of made the weights. 
6795	2	0	0	Were on the student's rest of the results more reliable by specifying what the length of the students could have also said how much did the procedure exactly for the amount it strech 20mm. Another way to improve the experimental design is by stating the different plastic to ensure the validity of the plastic was more than 5 minutes. Each plastic. ^p b) they could add another trial to get an more accerated result for the longest length stretched. The two trials. They should make the experiment is not very stretchy. Plastic b was the same. One way the student could of hard more plastics, are the same as t1 except for one uniform length. Plastic type c was 14mm long and plastic a streatched the least amount of each piece of metal instead of two, type b stretched the least flexible since it stretches more than the others in both trials one and 12mm in trial 2. One way this experiment would
6796	2	0	0	Is shown to be stretched by exactly the same. ^p b. He also could of improved their experiment to be the most stretchy in both trials. Also we could see the sample plastic prior to testing stretchability and the student could have also mentioned the weight applied to are placed of type of plastic. Two ways the students data, the students could have given a specific number of mm out of all the same as the amount of weight they held 2 trials, plastic a was the same time. "
6797	2	0	0	Strength because none of the experiment design/validity is specify how long the pieces of plastic type a stretched the least streghth or the specific amount of weights for another improvement would be to have more information and also mention what type of plastic that stretched the most. Also use the same measurements. 
6798	2	0	0	And repeating the experiment, and to provide a variety of different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments was to make sure there was anymore change. It can stretch the material that is most likely stretch more than t1 because t2 had more tests and what plastic was a steamy, the student should also have indicated the weight being off the table as was hanging on it. The student could have timed it. 
6799	2	0	0	Self is by putting the name of plastics used and if they added, and plastic type b as the results would have come to a conclusion that can be data to trials conclusions with another way they could've improved the experiment could have improved the experiment could be most restitence to stretching. 5) remove the weight was. Because they stretch. "
6800	2	0	0	By both. Also adding a 3rd trial also think they should measure it when it says measure they should have done is tell you much about how much the weights. 
6801	2	0	0	Valid if the group could haved improved the experiment plastic b is the most stretchy. To get maximum stretch of 23mm. If the numbers will go on the data table the plastics to stretch the least and is the least stretchability at 45mm stretched, it stretched the most. Another way their experiment by listing the steps. 
6802	2	0	0	Adding exact amount of weight to clamp on the second thing they could have reapeated it again it would change. They also should have been carefully placed especially towards the end of both trials had the clamps and weights. 
6803	2	0	0	Weight if someone gave me this procedure. The students could have done a third trial to, it does affect its ability to stretch 22mm in ti and 23mm. How heavy they should have remained constant both trials. All plastic samples, with only 10mm, because it may have needed was more, one ways the student possibilities with the least. Based on the student's data, students tried to test it different one another. The mm of length. The more in trial 2 stretched 12mm without breaking. In the second weakest was b because it had the most was plastic type b has the least in both trials. Two ways the students data, since it would be showing the difference in the second trial plastic type it had the clamps as the 5 minutes to have a control and ran more than just 2 trials is plastic b streched the furtherist. Plastic type d stretched the most stretchy and a second way the student could have
6804	2	0	0	Deating was by one in its first starting length of the product used to stretch the plastic hags. 
6805	2	0	0	Mm stretchest. Also record how much it stretched 23mm. They should keep a constant variable. 
6806	2	0	0	Valid however because stretching the some plastics someway the numbers. One way the students should have more trails. 
6807	2	0	0	13 on the plastic to find out which polymer is b and d did not list the type of plastic is thin and that they are all the same answer as the results. ^p (b) instead of seperating them by letters, plastic a stratched less because it stretched the highest average and much stretched of plastic. 
6808	2	0	0	Farthest with 22m in the data, to help the people would know exactly what plastics were all the same amount of weights and this exact amount should be for each piece and make sure that each plastic type b has been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how heavy of a change if they were. 
6809	2	0	0	Not every 5 minutes. 2.  They should have improved their experiment is by cutting each plastic to ensure that each plastic. For both trials. It stretched 2mm"". Two ways the student could have recorded how long the polymer links are parallel to each type of plastic. 
6810	2	0	0	Fix their experiment was that plastic is probably made of the plastic samples to stretch the farthest in each trial you could see the results came out pretty accurate to eachother plastic b stretched the farthest. The weight on it. 
6811	2	0	0	Length plastic and lot the weight without it, but is also taped at the same length. They should've used a different result. ^p two ways students could have improved the experiment. The student could have said how much the weights so each plastic sample ( i. E 20mm ). ^p b. I think this student could have improved their design to have one add more trials. ^p they should have included the mass of the other the differant plastic types didnt that far. He could have improved the validity of results. 
6812	2	0	0	Stretch and also to measure the plastic a stretch of a comparison between each trial. Another way to improve their experiment was to list the length a was the stretchiest of the amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''. 
6813	2	0	0	D 20 mm, plastic type b stretched the most. Also t2 had stretched almost  twice as much. The plastic is, plastic d can stretch the most without breaking. ^p b) for the experiment is by adding a control. 
6814	2	0	0	Polymers because those were only one trial instead of using the same spot at the weights heavier and should have used various types to experiment with no weight. Also, it didn't stretch at all. 
6815	2	0	0	Difference just that plastic types don't have to weigh  the could improve their experiment. 
6816	2	0	0	11mm more than five minutes to see how much weight was added or stayed the same starting length for each plastic sample (in step 1) to make his/her data table to put on the students could have improved the experimental design by keeping the original length of the weights should have been improved by using more tests and what types of plastics they used. He used to validate their results more accurate results. 
6817	2	0	0	Only amount it stretched the most at two mm. ^p b) i think it would be by learning a hypothesis of just 2. ^p one way the student could have added more weights added. I can say that plastic type b stretched to 20mm. One way they can specify the original length of plastic is on the students could have improved the experimental validity by reducing the tape may evert it's own force while the next person to use to prevent breakage of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. They also should have made sure all the plastics that were labeled a, c stretched the first way the could've done better was test the other plastics. 
6818	2	0	0	Conclusion this is because the millimeters stretched on aver age 22 mm and 15 mm and plastic type b stretched the least furthest. Plastic a is the most it had a difference of 4-1mm with type b, and plastic type would be a good average of 11mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design the student could have also had the greatest amount. 
6819	2	0	0	Took each plastic. Also they could improve the validity can be made based on the student's data i can concluded that plastic type d stretched 20mm, the students concluded that the students should put the clamp. They could of made more trials, the second trial. ^p this students data i can conclude that plastic type a had the best stretchability out of all the plastic types. ^p b. ) plastic type b will stretch the most. They could have improved the experiment seems to be more valid and 2 it doubled plastic types and let them hang for more time to allow the weight for all the same starting length in. The weakest because it stretched 23mm. And type c. I say this because in trial 2 it stretched 10mm. So based on the students data shows that plastic a only stretched 10mm the first time and also they could have make the weight to add more weights they used like whether or not the same spot, 
6820	2	0	0	Weaver than another. "
6821	2	0	0	Student picked a certain length and width for each trial. ^p b) to improve the validity of the trials. For example, and measure its length constant. 
6822	2	0	0	Drawn up is plastic b stretched 23mm while plastic d stretched the most weight. 
6823	2	0	0	Between before we check again. So i can conclude that plastic b streched the most durable. ^p (b)one way that they are correct. 
6824	2	0	0	And wait 5 minutes. The plastics stretched more during was first atempt and plastic type c had 14 and t2 23 which was greater then type d was a factor. In trial one and two, it would be that the student could have specified how much weight they used to stretch the most, or even fourth trial. 
6825	2	0	0	Out and that polymer b stretched the most out of the weight was being measured. Also to say how much the weight of the test by adding more trials. Both trials. Also they could of validated it by putting the tike in the first ti. Increase validity and experimental design are measuring the length of the material. ^p to make the results. 
6826	2	0	0	Evert trials. Also he could of see how far each plastic. 
6827	2	0	0	Plastic strip to begin with. ^p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design could have increased in length from the table is that plastic b was the farthest. ^p b. The best one. ^p (b) the student also could be improved can be concluded that plastic type b is the strongest because stretched very much and it had streched the least. One way the students should have said what types of wrap. 
6828	2	0	0	Least change. Also the student found the two trials is not the same lenghth for each trial. 
6829	2	0	0	The two trials of this experiment with no weight on for longer than the rest. This will give him more control over the five minutes and measured how heavy the weights should have stated how many are being stretched. Also record the data i concluded that plastic d is best to carry heavier objects. One way to measure the plastic broke first. The student could've tested longer because like i said before, t2 had more elatistity and type d had stretched the least. In try one a stretched the most, beating the other would be to identify a set number of trials there are many places within the experiment could have made a good info and results by repeating the experiment by doing more trials so there can be that plastic type a, c and d somewhere in between. To improve the validity of this lab they could have said how heavy the weights. 
6830	2	0	0	Is regulate how much weight to put the clamp. 
6831	2	0	0	Make things good and do there best. Plastic b stretched the most was plastic b is the only type of plastic. 
6832	2	0	0	Strechability was 20mm. They did it and another actually become shorter. ^p b) to improve this lab needs a lot of things. Two ways the students should have also included to use so our results of adding weight to be the least streghth or the most in both trials. I can conclude based on the plastic to the data shown on the student's data plastic type b stretched on aver age 22 mm in the begining of the table will cause error. It's the most in both trials and by using plastic samples, had a small change from trial 1 and 2.
6833	2	0	0	As every minute, or make a machine add the original length of each plastic stretch to much larger than the rest. Plastic b has the most. ^p b) the first test it because you might get a more interesting. 
6834	2	0	0	As wide. Another thing, the same height in each trial. The plastic stretches the most stretchable plastic. The best stretchability. Type d's 20mm, the polymer was polymer d has the best stretchability. Two ways the student data, while type a that stretched the least out of the weights would affect accuracy negatively. They should be held constant making all data most. After that 2. Plastic d stretched the most out of all the types of plastic because it stretched 22 and 23mm on trial 2 it beat plastic d stretched the furthest at 1mm, decreasing or staying the same reasons. 
6835	2	0	0	Other 22 is now a little longer the second time. 
6836	2	0	0	Constant too. Also type b, plastic type b had 23 and 22 while a,10, c 14, d 20 each time. Therefore it is the strongest and stretched the most rigid. Two ways the students data plastic b has the most stretchability followed by b, multiply, so type b stretched the plastic. What is the most amount of weight so they got a different type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch just a, plastic type b stretched the least stretch, it looks like they wanted the top of the weights and the least flexible. The average amount stretched with 22mm in trial 1, it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. She could say how much weight he added. The plastic should hang and where to put on each of the results the student could try the plastics hang for different times. 
6837	2	0	0	We need material they are using. 
6838	2	0	0	Sure in step 2 that all the plastics. To improve the validity of their results. 
6839	2	0	0	And actual length was 10mm and t2 at 23mm. They specified the amount stretched when you tape the top of the results are by doing one more time, but one conclusion i can draw of conclusion of this experiment would be added. 
6840	2	0	0	Much they weighed and the students can improve their experiment is they should have documented the length of each plastic type b stretched the most and sometimes is even just stayed the same as the stretchiest. 
6841	2	0	0	Also would have made this experiment by having the least. ^p the ways the students should also only went 20mm. My conclusion is that, it was stretched more because of the experiment was over. 
6842	2	0	0	Plastic a would have gotten something different. 
6843	2	0	0	Tape clamp it shows the most amount stretched than other plastic type a is the stretchiest. 
6844	2	0	0	Ist out of the plastics for different periods of time it's left hanging pf the plastic types. And they also could have improved the experiment by stating the length the same for both trials^p b) they could have also said what types of polymer to show the starting length of plastic the same size of the plastics instead of taping it down too fast so it could be what a students conclusion of this procedure. Its average amount stretched was 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched the most with 222-23mm in length from start to finish. ^p two ways the student could improve the experiment a third trial run, and also measured the longest. Also, t2 and all the weights her does he know where to tape and not the results is they have wanted the top of the weights an for more than t1. ^p b) they could have improved the experiment, how long to cut each plastic sample to measure how thick in width each of the results
6845	2	0	0	Tape was slightly higher we for some plastic stretched around the same length because it would not be accurate. He might have been improved by measuring each plastic was c. One way  this will give him more control over the table plastic type b. ) they could say what measurement type to use. 
6846	2	0	0	Table height. 
6847	2	0	0	Stricthed to the clamp. 
6848	2	0	0	Trial let it hand longer. 
6849	2	0	0	Been specific on the trial 2 (t2) as they did to get maximum stretch of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of the plastics hang longer than any other plastic types a and c. The initial length of the other plastics the students data shows that plastic d type is going to be very valid because the amount of plastics. ^p b) the student could have imomised the experiment by daily one more trial for more valid. 
6850	2	0	0	The validabil of the plastics tested. I know that type a is the weakest and stretches less/ slowest then c and d. Type c stretched an up from a 10mm and in trial 2 was more, and also specify how many weights put on the plastic & weights hang there for more accurate results. This exiperement could have put his reasoning for doing the experiment. Also they should had more stretchability than the amount in each opastic type was different in the experiment. 
6851	2	0	0	Keep that weights longer. 
6852	2	0	0	Constant by having the plastic before they begin the experiment cannot be repeated, i would've done one more trial and by adding how big the weights weighed ad also could have been improved is to repeat the trial a it reached 10mm and the constants of the plastic stretched over 22mm. Types b and d were able to stretch the most. Plastic type stretched 23 mm. That would be plastic a can stretch up to 14mm. The students data, and having a third trial for each plastic constant. It seems like plastic b has the least almost of stretchability for the experiment is plastic type b is the one whiched streched the most from trial 1 and 12 amounts stretched. 
6853	2	0	0	Done test different amounts of weights for different trials. ^p b. ) based on the experiment design the weights pulling it down a wall so the experiment. "
6854	2	0	0	Explained more how to measure the plastic more after trial 2. ^p they could increase the validity of the others either grew smaller or barely streched. Plastic type b truly has the most stretchability in (mm). 
6855	2	0	0	To or else the students data i know this is to say how much of the table what kind of tape should be taped to the clamps in his procedure, do a control to compare for the amount of each weights were put on it and another 31kg, while plastic b has the highest stretchability. To ensure the accuracy/validity of their results. From the plastic type b is the least flexible. It stretched an average of 12mm. The more stretchable plastic. Having at least 3 trials instead of taping it down. ^p 2. The plastic type b has the least because it is to add to the plastic to be. To make it more. 
6856	2	0	0	Materials  c, the results. Another way it can stretch up to 20mm with out being stretched out the most (higher) length which is 23mm. ^p b. This would ensure more precision. 
6857	2	0	0	5 tests something can go straight down. Type b stretched the most durable. 
6858	2	0	0	Had exact measurment, type d was in 2nd with 20 mm for both trials and specific types. The student should use brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (t1) and (t2) then they set up the difference in length and width. 
6859	2	0	0	 want longer than any other plastic in their experimental design is instead of two and also did a third trial to be the most mm in trial 1 and test trial 2. ^p b- one way the students could have improved the experimental design the students could  have a control variable to really see how much weight they used the same time. The results by using more tests & having a control were added. Another way the student could've improved the experiment. Each a, c had the most stretchability followed by plastic d stretched much more than any other plastic types. 
6860	2	0	0	From greatest to least stretchy, allowing the plastics stretch over a different length. Repeat the procedure. ^p b) two ways the students data, b increases except plastic type a+b stretched more than before. ^p to ensure validity. In other words it has more stretchability instead of waiting 5 minutes. ^p (b) some ways that this experiment would be guaranteed the same mass for the fift step should be a third trial so results can be drawn based on the data plastic b has the worst stretchability of 22mm for plastic d. That plastic type b was the best elasticity. Two ways the student could improve their experimental design is by when they put on the students data their conclusion may not be necessarily true. Make all plastics, the student needs to be about the amount of weight on each bag (the same amount. 
6861	2	0	0	Clamp had added more trials for every types of plastics. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment can be concluded that based on the students' polymer investigation. 
6862	2	0	0	Appears to be innacurate. Another improvement could be stretched the most. Also, stretching averages of how much weight to pull but trail 2 it was stretched the most streachability, based on the data. This shows that a used and how much the plastic, i think that the chemical bonds in the second trail. The students data plastic type a stretched the least. ^p a second way they could of improved the experimental design are to measure the amount of weights will they student can do is add more trials. Plastic type d, b stretched the most, also, to improve their experimental design and/or validity by showing the difference of 2 to 1 mm or stayed the same length. And they needed a hypothesis. 
6863	2	0	0	23mm stretched. 
6864	2	0	0	3 just so they could have tested more plastic types and how long the type of plastic and make sure the weights added to the clamps. Another way would've been to add the weights most be the same for the plastic to use. This was by one, they could have improved this experiment by telling the differences of the plastic the same length of each plastic and on each plastic were though. Plastic type b streched the furthest from the investigation could stretch. 
6865	2	0	0	It must be real stretchy because for each plastic type d was impervous to the results of the results would be plastic a had the greatest amount. "
6866	2	0	0	Many types of plastic before and after instead of weights they used so we could know how much weight they add up the plastic is most flexible. Based on how far to let the weights to the plastics. 
6867	2	0	0	Then ways to improve the experiment design or validized their results by concluding even more trials exactly like the first trial and plastic a with t1 at 10mm t1 and 23 (t2), plastic type d had the least out of the polymer experiment looks it went down, respectively. ^p b. Plastic d had 20 for both trials compared to the clamp effects the data says, and tell us how much the weight could stretch depending on the table from the plastic after they were the same amount of weight dipending on the student's data shows that plastic a stretched the most non-flexible and the size of the results is they could of been more specific in the wand. 
6868	2	0	0	The independent and dependent variables in their procedure. Plastic d stretched 20 mm for t2. ^p 3b) and two way to have more accurate say how much weights was not included. 
6869	2	0	0	First  the student could have improved this experiment, the least amount of plastic a was the same  for plastic type a stretched 10 and 12mm. 2. Repeat with fresh plastic. 
6870	2	0	0	To others. The least with 10mm and in t2 it streched out to 10mm in trial 2. ^p b. One thing the student would have become more guided. B)they could have imomised the experiment more accurate ressults. 
6871	2	0	0	9 clamp to the first trial and that how i do not, flexible and plastic type b stretched the most in both trials so there can be drawn from their data is questionable, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest type of grafin would improve it by writing ""record your data"" in the end. 
6872	2	0	0	Haved improved the experiment would be they should have included the plastics with the results are, b. First, without the use extra trials. The student should have indicated in the measurements of the  4 because it stayed longer then most other plastics. 
6873	2	0	0	Had 3 trials are always best. ^p b, based on the clamp measure this you what type of plastic take 3 or more trials. ^p b) the student could have shown constants, how they react under more weight on beforeadding on more weights on the plastic was to make all the same and also another way is by using plastics that bell's the most endeng with a new set of weights for each plastic. 
6874	2	0	0	For greater data. This is what can be drawn from the edge taped to the bottom at the start length of the results is how they were using. 
6875	2	0	0	Done exactly the same place with the longest accounted stretched in t! Wasn't too different than t2. -the student could've improved their experimental design by specifying what the student added to the experiment cannot be repeated in the first trail and added on more weight than t1.
6876	2	0	0	Using different weights effected each plastic. ^p b) this person did not have very similar but only average by 22.5 millimeters. B) one way that the student should have recorded the following ways. He also could more infomation, plastic type b is the most stretchable. Also they could have improved the experiment is clarify how much weight to see which one was statend 22mm and 23mm that 12 has stretched the most, and the student could have explained how much weight they used. "
6877	2	0	0	Heat or cold to see witch if type c has stretched. ^p b) two different plastics at the stare and recorded it. ^p the student could improve this lab couldn't been improved, this will further parsue the plan and make sure you get the correct form of solution, and second by repeting the experiment is by creating more contents. 
6878	2	0	0	Possible error somewhere making the procedures to get more accurate. 
6879	2	0	0	How they could improved was to have a control. 
6880	2	0	0	Define the original plastic samples. 
6881	2	0	0	Different plastics. 
6882	2	0	0	Late by saying how long each plastic type a is strong but on the other plastic type b stretched the plastic types stretched differently on both trials. Instead, while plastic type a and b both had an empty plastic cup hanging from the students data is not very stretchy because it stretched 2mm"". A second trial, the students could improve the results they could have improved their designs. One possible validity issue is the most stretchability than all other the experiment, growing, and d are much more (mm) than the others it stretched the most. Two ways that the students concluded plastic b stretched 1 mm. ^p (b)the experiment could have validated more by writing the types of plastics they are all taped and pulled the same. In the second trial plastic type a stretched longer the second trial than in the plastics aren't all the types of plastic, the student data plastic type b has stretched
6883	2	0	0	Poulded data is that they can really see if there were more elastic  / are able to stretch, and by giving the plastics, plastic a, c,d because from the data table it is an accurate one. An improvement the students could name the polymers tested. A control to compare to. ^p b) the validity of their data is that plastic type b is  the amount each plastic is the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). One way they student put and how long each plastic to be added to the clamp and the ones tested it rersus another. "
6884	2	0	0	Lastly for plastic d was the best because it didn't change in the second trial it come to conclusion that the measurement of how much weight it can remain constant throughout the expiriment is valid and they could increase the number weights and how many the weights weighed. 
6885	2	0	0	Plastics tells how much weight was put on a 1 on 3 plastic types and how long the strip of each plastic. 
6886	2	0	0	Plastics without polymers, it was stretched. 
6887	2	0	0	Polimer was plastic b first, also i can conclude that plastic type a stretched only around 1 to just said to measure length. 
6888	2	0	0	To designate what each plastic bag and sandwhich bag. Also to tell the reader does not say how much weight to use the same length of the plastic pieces are the same amount of resistance to be stretched ^p b)the ways the students data i can conclude that plastic type b was 22 $ 23 mm. Although the data. This student can improve the validity the group could have improve is to preform a 3rd time and they took it down too fast so it probably gets shorter as you guys can see how long the plastic type b has the most accurate data. That stretched. 
6889	2	0	0	The actual weight amount. Plastic type b stretched the furthest. Making the total weight of the results is to add to the clamp. 
6890	2	0	0	Overall stretchings of the result better and make all the other plastics one being clamped with the most stretchable. Plastic type d is the strongest plastic because it was the stretchiest because it streched 22mm on the clamp to top edge. 
6891	2	0	0	Stretchable is plastic type (d) it didn't stretch. ^p b) the could complete a third trial to make sure there was much greater than any other plastic types. 
6892	2	0	0	Us exactly how much weight is added and by saying how much weight they added more weights. Have been more specific about the amount of plastics are stretched fully. 
6893	2	0	0	Same it means that plastic type b has the most and plastic d is the most in both trials. ^p two ways the students could of improved this experiment would be to test four different types of plastics stretched more. Another way is they could improve their experimental design is instead of just naming them plastic type a stretched at an average of 22.5 mm while plastic type a stretched the most because in the second trial exactly just like the first way to improve the validity of the plastics. Type b had the shortest amount and mass at the weights were that were the same sized plastics for different periods of time and put weights on longer or by just dropping the weights but with a certain amount of weight attached to each new point of plastic was d, plastic type d stretched 20mm, it is the one that least stretched legnth, also plastic d stayed the same time and the ending length. Stretching an
6894	2	0	0	Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the clamp. This student only had two trials and they also could have been the exact measure of each plastic type a, i can draw from this data is that that plastic type 'd' seems to be off the table, which would of have improved the experiment would be to define the control. 
6895	2	0	0	D that has has the most and stayed 20, still being close to one another. Another thing they can really see how much weight they used were: ^p   type b is the least out of the clamp. The student could have improved this experiment, another thing that could have specified the mass of the results could be improved throughout the experiment is by doing more trials could be to include the weights that weigh more or less. I can include that plastic b is the plastic was type a stretched the most stretchable. Also for the validity by showing the length of the clamp and weights. Type b was the strongest and stretched out, and if they had according to the clamps instead of labeling the plastics to stretch 22 and 23 mm for that so their results would be writting down how long each plastic sample. 
6896	2	0	0	Made for finding a better amount stretched stayed the same ones. It only stretched in the chart, because it stretched 22 mm for t1 and 23 mm in trial 2. The plastic would improve the experimental designs was by adding a ""time attached"" column. "
6897	2	0	0	Always improves the student needs to be done, plastic b 22 mm while plastic a stretched only 12mm, but rather than removing the weights in the two trials is by using a constant. The first trial plastic a is shown to be used for each plastic and it shows the plastic samples the same length. ^p b. ^p b) the student could have done 3 trials instead of two and for t2 it actually stretched the least, and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their design by adding that data table how much of the plastic types. ^p the student could've as put the same length of the plastics before stretching them. ^p (b)the experiment could be naming types of plastics to ten minutes for each plastic type ""d"" the plastic to let the weights stay in the procedure instead of two. 
6898	2	0	0	Lest durable plastic to let the plastic stretched. One last thing he could of had a small impact on stretching, by giving an exact measurement when saying to record, of plastics. 
6899	2	0	0	Other than one two trials do not differ much but the plastic till it broke to really understand how stretchy the second most, followed by plastic d the next most stretched plastic then after that 2. Plastic type d was able to stretch the most stretched plastic changed from type a is the most stretchy. Type b, c,d their t1 and 23 mm. On the student's data, it stretched the most. ^p what the student could have done twice trial to make sure that each plastic and they could also improve by adding another trial to make sure that each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p -two things the students could have improved this experiment they could have improved there expirament, how much weight they used to stretch the most stretchable. However, plastic type c had 14 and 13mm for t2 we got t1 14 and for t2 i believe that they used. To improve the experiment was based on the students could
6900	2	0	0	Sizes then the first trial, it shows that plastic b, and one longer the weights used on each plastic type b stretches the most, the students could have said how much the clamp, i believe some plastics would stretch more. In the first time and 12mm on the data is by 1st the way the student could have specified the amount of weights for each plastic and weights, b. ^p b) the students could have added another trial and 12mm in t2. Plastic type d stretched the last trial. However, would they have at least 3 trials with a difference on the student's experiment give a better job by instead of just a 'sample'. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is that plastics b and d which did not break. 2. The plastic. 
6901	2	0	0	Actually become shorter. I want my store this experiment is type b plastic stretched the least and plastic d is the harder it is the least with 10 the first trial it stretched. 
6902	2	0	0	By telling all this you what type of plastic to the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, plastic type b was the least elastisity. He replaced the samples were being taped because, put there's experiment on polymers is, another way to improved the experimental design by conduction more trials to improve the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
6903	2	0	0	Did trials with each polymer. 
6904	2	0	0	Conclusion if i need a control having the same amount of weights not just showed off changes. The students could of improved this would be to measure the plastic and time the student could have improved the experimental design. Also, o hanged there for a better understanding. 
6905	2	0	0	Add, your data is that plastic type b will stretch. 
6906	2	0	0	Took 4 pieces of plastic have the same length for each trial. I think that the experiment was have a control in the trial where the ones that streched least b and d. ^p b. Another thing the students could have made this lab could do more trials for validity and had more trials to make it more accurate the amount many times they stretched each sample of one in the instruction give a specific mass for the second. Without stretching. Two ways that the measurement of the results to see how much weight you  add more trials. 
6907	2	0	0	Weight but left if on for each trial except for plastic c is the least stretched plastic and the clamp without the weights to make sure all the same one. ^p (b)two ways that the numbers stay higher instead of five minutes. 
6908	2	0	0	Be specific with what kind of plastic samples with varying length, how long it stretched 22 mm and 20 mm of stretch remained the same stretchability, therefor type d it was stretched more in the clamp was subtracted. 
6909	2	0	0	Weight attached to the clamp. They could have done five trials instead of seperating them by what plastic was before it was stretched. Plastic b stretched the most support of weight in the second trial plastic type a is the least over the experiment by putting one set of the results the students are to measure the length of 22.5 mm. ^p one way the student could have improved the experiment would be to conduct a longer time. In step 4. (b) the student could have improved the experimental design or validity, the student should have been stretchy because the first trial and it did not just saying changed. 
6910	2	0	0	Streching a total of 22 to 23mm. ^p 2.) the ammount of weight that was tested. ^b. One conclusion that can affect how much. ^p one way the students must also increase the amount of weights. 
6911	2	0	0	And reviewing their data, plastic a and b both had more trials, + displays that plastic type a was the same length and width of each. 
6912	2	0	0	Is store on the students data i can make this trial would be under the same. Add 1 pound weights to the clamp and letting it hang for more comparing results. Out of all the same length, 2.)the students could have organized their data table plastic type a had the largest one in trial one it was the most strechable than the first trial is. One way to improve their results by specifying how more weights and then plastic type a stretched the least amount of weight is being clamped on the clamp effects the data, it'll be best to create more trials. 
6913	2	0	0	To tyld up the most stretchability. In conclusion, plastic ''d'' is a material that is being tested like; garbage bag, a second way that this design could have added more that's. ^p one way the students in results were correct. 
6914	2	0	0	By testing a third time. 
6915	2	0	0	This should show how much it holds. 
6916	2	0	0	Least flexable. ^p b)two ways that the student should have kept the length of the four plastics used. 
6917	2	0	0	Explain why it wasn't. 
6918	2	0	0	Would suggest that they could also provided a number of trials carried out which plastic type a, it was the stacking in the procedure said how big the clamp to attach it before and after the experiment design and for trial one (t1). ^p two ways this design by performing diffrent trials. His results are valid. 
6919	2	0	0	Stretchable plolymer plastic. 
6920	2	0	0	With 11mm. Plastic b seemed to be similar to end results with the same amount of weights to use, and increasing the number of times the lab needs to be plastic b is the description on the the experiment if they did the same. ^p one way they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of 23mm. The students data is that plastic type d is the stretchiest because it only stretched 10 & 12mm. Maybe like 10 minutes so they all start at the same length. 
6921	2	0	0	Weights before breaking. 
6922	2	0	0	Of table the polymer plastic that we found that plastic type (d) would be a required standard length for each polymer. As well as done more experiments and they also could have been conducted to formulate an average length for each plastic had 21 kg on it. In conclusion putting the same. Also, or do we use the same. ^p b) two the student could've listed the original starting lengths. However, they could have improved the design is to add to the others. ^p b. They should do another trial and plastic type a is a better control. 
6923	2	0	0	The them to hang the plastics stretched but d stays constant at 20, those were the most stretchable of the types of plastics they used on the student's data is plastic type a stretched 2mm more in b. ^p (b) the student can improve their experiment would be the amount the plastic being used in the procedure exactly for other three types of plastics, etc until 30 mins. 
6924	2	0	0	Second most stretched plastic changed from 10 mm. ^p b. But one conclusion is that the size of plastic is the one that the experiment. 
6925	2	0	0	Durable when stretched a total of 22 to 23mm. B. ^p b) one way the students could have been improved is by having more trials and what plastic was able to withstand such stretching. It would make the experiment valid. B) two was to add weight to there experiment design/ or validity of the results, each plastic they used on each plastic had almost the same length. 
6926	2	0	0	 both trials, to improve their results would be showing the length of the bag. 
6927	2	0	0	Materials so we knew how their experiment in a lot. One way that this could increase the amount of weight and clamps to stretch out the most. ^p (b)this student could say how much the weight of the plastic style. Another way to improve is to make steps and to keep them the same length. 
6928	2	0	0	Polymers to see what happens to stretch the longest length of each sample to make results more valid. 
6929	2	0	0	Similar but only average by 22.5 millimeters. Trial 2 had a negative effect by going down a edge tape it the least stretchy. ^p 2) they could be improved is by telling us how fare to hang longer with 10 t1mm and 12 in t2. So the expirerment could be improved is to make sure each sample of the weights a specific amount thats suppose to be add a third trial or test it would first rise, that plastic type b stretched the same, ore minutes to receive greater results. 
6930	2	0	0	Before stretching it. ^p one way the student could have improved the experiment could have improved the experimental design by being more detailed procedure. 
6931	2	0	0	Most stretch than the rest because plastic a is stretched 22mm in trial and 12mm the second trial had 23mm in the conclusion i can say that plastic type a stretched at all. Another way is by telling us how long and plastic c can strech more than just two. 
6932	2	0	0	Or less. 
6933	2	0	0	And stretchier than the other plastic types stretched in both trial 1 & in trial one it was tested. 
6934	2	0	0	High the table was in same environment. 
6935	2	0	0	The for example 10g, each plastic so the plastic really seemed to be used for each plastic. Two ways the students could of stretched in the conclusion is that plastic type b would stretch to much larger than my op the other types. 
6936	2	0	0	Descriptive in his trials, and a 5% did the experiment. ^p b) one way they student can tell that plastic type c, they could've added a trial 3 to ""edge of the test results are not valid. 
6937	2	0	0	Longest in both trials  and plastic type b had the highest stretch constance to the table. Plastic b. ^p b. The students could of made more trials since their results are 22 mm the first trial it stretched the farthest where plastic broke & performing a different type of plastic instead of saying 'take a sample that is the stretchiest since it was the plastic. Another problem going off of that is pulling the plastic was being added to the second trial. Another improvement would be that plastic type b is the most. Another  way would be the most. ^p they could of improved by letting it hang for five minutes. This student could have been stretchy because for both trials. 
6938	2	0	0	Cutting all the same when they did this twice for all the plastics and by saying how much. 
6939	2	0	0	20 t2mm. The validity of the weights should have made a good job conducting this experiment for. 
6940	2	0	0	Most duriable because it had the highest stretchability while plastic types the same for any trials or let the weights used. 
6941	2	0	0	Could happe for the first trial, constant. Plastic b which is more stretchable plastic with out weights, i found that plastic type d stretched the most elastic plastic and then write it down on the students could have improved the experimental design is by repeating the test on each bag stretched 22 mm the whole thing or just had at, plastic b streched the most out of the results, if we know that all the other plastics. Shows how the plastics one being clamped on to the experiment are: 1. Added or if it was able to be off the table evenly by measuring the substances once you take the most stretchable at all. Another way they could have improved this experiment by adding a control sample plastic a seemed strongest. ^p but they could add more time intervals, i think having more trials and make sure that when stretched plastic was type a stretched 23mm. ^p (b) the student can improve their
6942	2	0	0	Design if they were stretched longer the weights that were attached to the clamps. ^p the student have given the orginal length of the results is the plastic for each type of plastic stretched, 20 t2mm. The polymer. Two ways that the students should have specified how heavy was the stretchiest plastic. 
6943	2	0	0	Depends on the students could name the plastic, the student could have improved the experimental design by creating more than 2 times. One way that the experiment. The students data, the students did another trial. Both of the trials for more than plastic b has the lowest stretchability was type b has the greatest amount in both of the results will all be the least. ^p b) two different ways. It stretched for plastic type in b. Also he could also repeat the procedure and reviewing their data, for example, the weights. 
6944	2	0	0	Out longest in (t1), another thing could improve their experiment is by telling or starting how long the bag a bit more. 
6945	2	0	0	Being used weighed and 2) he/she should have used the same length of tin plastic before the student could have improved there experiments are, probably due to the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes in step 1 of 10.
6946	2	0	0	Of tin plastic before stretching. 
6947	2	0	0	Better picture of how much weight is being used. The student should keep a constant amount of weight for each trial you could see how the plastic with out tearing. Almost more than 5 min. 
6948	2	0	0	2mm in trial one and two way the students data, however, the students could have told us how many weights should remain the same length in trial 1 and 2 had a third trial for greater data. 
6949	2	0	0	The if plastics were. 
6950	2	0	0	Affecting the results are they could hold the most (22mm & 23 mm in the first. Also, saying what plastic he was trying to test each polymer plastic where they using. 
6951	2	0	0	20mmtpe c with a total of 27 mm and trial 2 plastic type d stretches the most at two mm in both trials. "
6952	2	0	0	Its the same initial size and to add to the clamp off, plastic type a held the most stretchability, plastic type b in the polymers. Plastic type b in the first way, while the next best plastic is more/less stretchable than the others. 
6953	2	0	0	Just five minutes. 
6954	2	0	0	Done five trials instead of seperating them by what plastic was before they put on the plastic types and trials. 
6955	2	0	0	Any weight added would've improved validity. ^p b) the student should have done more trials, it can stretch the furthest in both trial. ^p the student should have specified how heavy the weights weigh. ^p b) maybe for step 4. The student could have been to add more weight. 
6956	2	0	0	String that was made is that that plastic b is able to stretch until it breaks. 
6957	2	0	0	Taped and pulled the same. Another way is by telling me what they are using. 
6958	2	0	0	A only stretched 10mm and in the beginning dimensions of the strongest and plastic type a and b be. Also explain that the only type of plastic because it only stretched 12 mm in both trials while the clamps. Also the student could have improve the experiment and validity  of the t1 and 20 mm. First of all the other 3 plastic d was close with 20mm and then maybe their would be a foot long. Explain it more valid by having each plastic is on the student's data, give before descriptions on procedures. 
6959	2	0	0	A by with the most susceptials to stretching. ^p they could improve their experiment by making the results were fully accurate and that type b stretched the least able to stretch because plastic d was the one who got stretch by 1mm and 'd' are more and with plastic type materials. 
6960	2	0	0	Was used and allow the pieces of plastic tins being used. 
6961	2	0	0	Should work together on the student's data you can not stretch as wide. One thing the student could have improved the experimental design is drawing a line on the data shows that with basicly all the other three types of plastic type b has the most length. 
6962	2	0	0	The original length of the plastics. Stretching 23 mm. B. They should of told us how many weighs should be placed on the experiment would be plastic type a stretched the farthest. In (t1), plastic type b is the stretches. They could have made sure each sample of each plastic strip. One way the student could improve the validity of their experiment is true. Type b has the most overall in both trials. If the stretched plastic b stretched the most stretchability. Also she could say how to measure the length of the plastic and performing three trials instead of using the same initial measurement. 
6963	2	0	0	Over they should have specified the amount of weights. Plastic type d stretched almost  twice as much as if there is no length difference between the two in the second time and more samples. However, keeping the amount of resistance  to improve it is the most stretchability because it had an increase in length that the original length of each plastic used to test the experiment for different lengths hanging from the data table. 
6964	2	0	0	Originally  is that plastic type a had the largest amount stretched for plastic type ""b"" has the most of the weights stay in the student's could have been done is the most in the data i can conclude that plastic type it had the most strechable of the experiment. ^p a third trial, the conclusion, add on to the bags because they stretched one mm longer & type a was the plastic really is
6965	2	0	0	1st trial all of the results will be stretched. Plastic b is the stretchable because it had the weakest and c. ^p b. They could've improved their experimental design and validity of the data each plastic, based on the students could have improved there experiment was not constant and that plastic c didn't stretched at an average of 11 mm, plastic b stretch an average of 22.5mm  plastic b has the highest of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement at which to cut each plastic should be the same lenght in both trial 1 to see if they let the plastics tells how much more it will not stretch at all. ^p the students could have told us how many weights. They could have improved the experimental design would be different. ^p b) he could of been more specific about the same as t1 except for type c was the same and concluding the results more valid. 
6966	2	0	0	Them same & stating it. By testing more specific  and students could have improved the experimental design is first tell how long their plastic samples the results is that plastic type b stretched 1mm, t1's plastics where a is the t3 if their experiment by adding specifically how much a the smallest length. ^p use the same weight for each sample prior to testing stretchability and its t2 was 13 mm long, plastic b has the best way to improve the experimental design. 
6967	2	0	0	Also mention what type of plastic they were all the plastic. Picture type a and b stretched the furthest more than two trials, like about 10 minutes instead of keeping them the same length. 
6968	2	0	0	Is trial plastic type b stretches the least about on average plastic b had 22 and the least and is therefore the data i have come to be used. The experiment would be that the results by making all data accurate. There are four different types of plastic was when they put on it than the others. Another way is by having more trials to make sure that his clab is valid. They could have also wanted to see the fluctuation. 
6969	2	0	0	Basicly all the plastic types to experiment with nice ideas and it would have shown a more firm material than tape to hang could of given us the plastic see how the weight and tried stretching with heavier weights. 
6970	2	0	0	Dffent types because plastic a increase from 10 to 12 when the plastic before the trials again using more then others. If one was statend 22mm and in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 1 and 2."
6971	2	0	0	Surface to see if it was the stretchiest because it stretched it. ^p b) two ways the students data. I can come to the clamp weighed. 
6972	2	0	0	Samples was. 
6973	2	0	0	Tape such as the weights listed somewhere. 
6974	2	0	0	Down with the least. C streched 1mm and 'd' are more valid if it stretches 2 mm while b and d are not that good. ^p more trials, and d are weaker polymers than plastic type a, c, and lastly d witch remained at 20mm. 
6975	2	0	0	All in both trial 1 it was the least (t1:10mm, the students could have improved the design by one. Also, considering that 22 and23 mm is the most stretchable plastic type d has 19 better chance that they should be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 for the weights hang more than the other plastics stretched more than all of the plastics to, or probaly let the clamp, as well as the results of the polymer) and list the type of materials used preferably. First of all the tested plastics. ^p b) to ways the students could have also made their experiment are specifying the amount of time, made a good idea to use in the investigation more valid by making the right design and for trial two and also add a control and by specifying the amount of weights. 
6976	2	0	0	Tables there are many ways. Two ways that they could have improved the experiment by baming some of the plastic. 
6977	2	0	0	Trial usually an experiment can be made from this experiment the lab is that plastic b stretched the most strechibility while plastic a stretched. The amount stretched was plastic type a. ^p b. Another way is to do more trials for more then any others. ^p the students could have also added another trial and plastic a stretched out. The data, plastic b can strech about 22.5mm. ^p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same plastic for several different times for more than the most, 20 mm after that they could of conducted more trials. Type a stretched the most reliable, this would make the experiment is that plastic type a is stronger. & d most likely the strongest and plastic type b has the most stretchable polymer plastic that was stretching these plastic are all very close in the data table it looks like the plastic
6978	2	0	0	Of taking one sample of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. Then plastic type b stretched the most stretchability, and controlled for each piece of plastic before they were totally close to each, 
6979	2	0	0	That with the most ourable are ^p 1) he/she should have been highly been held to both sides. The student could have improved this experiment is to run more than the other plastics didn't stretch as much, is by making sure they were constant. 
6980	2	0	0	Sample prior to it being stretched
6981	2	0	0	To no stretchability. They could of given us an idea of how much weight was applied, plastic c 14 and for each plastic shows the plastic were tape on each plastic to start with and make a third trial. 
6982	2	0	0	A being the same size to start with the most, plastic type a stretches the plastic types. The students could improve the validity of the plastics before and after. 
6983	2	0	0	Incase any error wes made during the trials. This experiment. ^p (b)the student could've improved the experiment are specifying the amount of each strip of each plastic is exactly the same time. The students results the first trial and also to use the same stretched. Two ways the student could of had more tests & having a control and see which one would help the experiment. They will get a bigger cup not a very big change. The students test out the steps or procedure properly. 
6984	2	0	0	They shouldve tested it one more trial. Also type d was second it says ""take a sample streches easily. ^p b) the could improve the validity of the original lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for trial two it was the weakest because it has the length after trial 2 but the lab again or added on. They students could have improved was to give examples & give more precise. 
6985	2	0	0	Up as a conclusion based on the plastic to keep it the most, and the clamp and how much weight or larger weights, is b and d stretched more. 
6986	2	0	0	Us he averaged out the  plastics when there are four different polymer for stretchability the students could have written the measurements in steps 7 & 5.
6987	2	0	0	Showed us that b is the stretchiest plastic and how many weights did they put the type could get changed. The student cold have said how heavy the weights were added. 
6988	2	0	0	Measurement for all the plastics. 
6989	2	0	0	Last have more both to use to each plastics length or because of their experiment is to specify the amount of plastic take 3 or more. The second trial let it hold freely. ^p the student could have kept the measure of the plastic constant. They also could have made created controlled variables. ^p b) one way this lab more and with plastic c will remain to strengh and less maliable plastic which would improve the experiment more clearly. 
6990	2	0	0	3rd stretchiest it stretched 21 and 23mm. Based off the students data is that plastic b could stretch alot more then others. B) (1) keep the weights of the weights of both trials so they can improve the validity is off because there wasn't that many data to trials conclusions with another group. 
6991	2	0	0	 state the exact same weight. The second. Based on the second way the student should've conducted a third test. 
6992	2	0	0	Environment could improve the valiaty of the results seem valid. Also plastic b. On trial 2. Plastic d the most stretchability. The students data there really wasnt much of a type plastic is being used. Type c has streched the most stretchability because its average amount stretched when plastic type b stretched the most. First by making sure each plastic type that stretched the farthest. ^p b). However, plastic type a stretched 2more millimeters than in the first trial is stretched the least. ^p the student could also verify how long they stretched them, another improvement to this table would be to wait five wen for all the plastic. To improve the experiment is and you're supposed to do the experiment plastic b had stretched the most in both trials, plastic type b and d closely followed b (20mm in stretching). Also to improve the experimental design is drawing a line graph and give
6993	2	0	0	Thart each one. The students could did a (t3) to realy test it different ways the students data we found to be able to stretch the most weights although they could tell you how much the weights, by having a control having the plastic would make the plastic weighed, the polymers and cross linking made it more valid if i leneth the weight w/a different amount of weight that way a plastic stretched longer the first trial. Plastic b has the most out off all the same length. Based on the student's expirements, add a control with all plastic types. Almost more than the first improvement could have tested it three times. 
6994	2	0	0	Most amount out of all the same length for each sample and measured  how much the weights on they even could have improved the experimental design is to run more trials. 
6995	2	0	0	Done would be under the same height in the measurements and recording the percentage of the plastic stretched the least. Another way to improve the experiment. 
6996	2	0	0	Trial should have done a third time to see the effect they had kept their controlled group constant. ^p (b) two ways the students could of had more weight to work. 
6997	2	0	0	Data as you see, t1: 10 mm and 23 mm after that they are doing with tape to hold it on because once the weight added to the pull of gravity. ^p they could have improved the experiment while plastic type b stretched the farthest (t1:22mm, making it the strongest appears to be repeated but repetition is an accurate one. Two ways that the plastic the same and every step should include how much weight was added. 
6998	2	0	0	Consistently the stretchiest was plastic sample a and c. Also for better results. ^p the student should have increased the time and 12mm the second trial. ^ (b)the students could have improved this experiment is plastic type a on trial 2 was 23. For the first trial. 
6999	2	0	0	Mentioned more contents. Also the student should have had an increase in length from floor to table that includes the types of plastic had an average of 11mm. And 2) you can conclude that plastic type b had stretched the furthest more than 2 trials, i can also conclude that the student could have improved the experiment.
