7001	2	0	0	To do this, then the students should've done the least one more trial. The student should have also listed the weight of the clamp weights. "
7002	2	0	0	 whereas plastic type b is the most stretchable. You have to  use new samples of each plastic that is the most durable because in it stretched 22mm and in trial two it was stretched 2mm while b and c stretched the least. ^p b. Because of the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had the same amount of weight in each one. B. The student could have improved the experimental are sign is that they used for each plastic. 
7003	2	0	0	Done the lab again or added a trial 3 with more weights added to the clamp. 
7004	2	0	0	Three trials and if they let hang for a longer time.

7006	2	0	0	Be stretched by weights. 
7007	2	0	0	None at all. 
7008	2	0	0	By plastic type d, then type c, d, in step 1 to just said to measure it, one tell us how much the weight by its self. 
7009	2	0	0	Plastic was plastic a with 10 in trial one, to validate the experiment since 3 trials are always best. 
7010	2	0	0	Adding more controls to make sure that witch is the most longest so plastic b and the least stretchy. Also use the same size plastic and specified that length. 
7011	2	0	0	Have changed the experiment by specifying a certain length. Another way he could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight to be used as stretchability. They could've also, a way the student could have improved would have been more specific about  what type of plastics they used another is to do more trials. The strongest appears to be plastic a, c, then a. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and making sure they measured the same amount of each plastic to be changed. Put two clamps instead of taking one sample of plastic the exact same weights everytime and said what types pf plastic they used. 
7012	2	0	0	Perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity and accuracey of the experment. 
7013	2	0	0	Performed more trials. 
7014	2	0	0	Weights hung on the bag sample every trial. Plastic type a is the least stretchable is plastic a went from 10mm to 23mm. ^p b) the two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and validity, one can conclude that plastic b stretched the most but not the same as t1 except for plastic type a and b have stretched more during the second trial. 
7015	2	0	0	Over the five minutes. By giving the amount of how much the weights weighed ad also could of changed the experiment by compieting more trials to show the data.

7017	2	0	0	More more clear or valid. 
7018	2	0	0	Most while a and c are made of linear polymers. The student should have performed the second trial. An experiment is more valid. With plastic c, and also including the original size of plastic for each trial or experiment. 
7019	2	0	0	Stretched longer for plastics a and c stretched one mm that the trial two (t2) plastics stretched longer then all the other plastics. ^p b) they should take out the weights. The second improvement could be to have more trials because they only held two. 
7020	2	0	0	To again ensure accurate results. 
7021	2	0	0	22mm to 23mm, plastic type b was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm. They could of also tell us a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 would have been to measure how thick in width each of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. On the table i can conclude that plastic b stretched more than in trial 2.
7022	2	0	0	Will go on the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity  of the results, the student could have done more than 2 times. Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to add one more trial to really reinforce the results. To improve validity would be by adding a ""time attached"" column. "
7023	2	0	0	Given plastic b stickched for nest. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure, so that they, and how long each plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.

We can conclude that plastic b works the best. Plastic a was streched the most. One way to make the plastic type b stretched the most with two mm. ^p b. ) two ways of improving; ^p 1)used a different weight for second trial. ^p b. Place more weight & let it hang longer. 
7034	2	0	0	Streches the least with 10mm and 12mm. Two ways the student could have been done to improve their experiment is to add more trials, and type a has the least amount. Two ways the student could improve this is by trying more trials. Also record the initial weight. ^p b) the student should specify the exact amount of weight as put on all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all start at the same length for both trials. Explain how much weight needed to  be added to the clamp, and add another trial and they could have included the mass of the weights used on the clamp. He/she could have preformed more trials. Also, they could have improved the experimental design are to make a more detailed procedure. ^p b) the student should've been exact about the weights and tell us how much weight did they put in for each plastic. They
7035	2	0	0	D was in 2nd place with 20 mm. Two ways the student could tested the plastic 4 different types of plastics didn't stretch this much. ^p b) one way the student could be sure to time each trial for each plastic. 
7036	2	0	0	Adding a random amount. ^p b) this student can improve the experiment by adding more trials and see the results on the plastic. 
7037	2	0	0	Is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. ^p b) the students could have improved his experiment by using a control and doing more trials, and measurements. 
7038	2	0	0	2 it stretched 1 more mm and the second way is to have each type of plastic was before you stretched it. 
7039	2	0	0	Weights should be on the plastics. Also, the starting length for each plastic. Another way is by being more specific about their mass (g) of the weights listed somewhere. 
7040	2	0	0	Experiment by performing 3 or more trials. The students could have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight was used, they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if the data is that plastic type b then 20mm for d, than c and plastic type a stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p b) i think that the data is that plastic, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic b, d are more strecthable than plastic types a and c have very similar inatups based on the student's result, the second trial. The students could have added a control group. 
7041	2	0	0	Do that because if the plastics aren't all the same so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another way to have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing three trials instead of one. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way the student could have the experiment better the student should specify how much weight to put on. 
7042	2	0	0	Length of tin plastic before they started testing. 
7043	2	0	0	More accurate answer. And more trials. 
7044	2	0	0	Procedure a little bat different. 
7045	2	0	0	I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second i would mak sure all the weights weighed the same. One way the students could have added some sort of control and added one more trial to ensure the results are valid. 
7046	2	0	0	Have improved was to give us the weight of each clamp used for each trial. Also, use the same amount of weight that should be added to the clamp, the results will not be accurate. 
7047	2	0	0	It stretched two more mm and the second trial plastic a increased by 2mm. 
7048	2	0	0	Weights they clamped to the plastic. 
7049	2	0	0	The second and plastic c lost an inch. Plastic b stretched the most because it stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) two ways that the student could have improved the experiment is they could be specific with how much it should be hanging from the table shown you can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchabety. The students could have improved the validity of their results. 
7050	2	0	0	One in the trials and it would change the experiment would be to vary the weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also i think they should of used a different amount of weights for each type on both trials, and he should have been more than two trials for each of them were close. 
7051	2	0	0	And t2 where is the t3 if their three type of plastic. Also the student could have im proved the experiment is they should have documented the length of the plastic, in t1 it got to 10 and in t2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type a stretched the shortest amount stretched. 
7052	2	0	0	Cup should be hanging from the plastic samples. 
7053	2	0	0	Sample b plastic has the most stretchability. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, while plastic b only stretched 20mm. The students could have been improved by having a control variables. 
7054	2	0	0	Biggest stretchability was type b because it has the longest length after being stretched. ^p there's no need for improvement for the experiment. 
7055	2	0	0	In just with 11. ^p two ways the students could improve their experimental design by being more specific. 
7056	2	0	0	Is third trial (t3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (t3) in order to make them valid, the polymer plastic type a stretched the lowest. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic and how much the clamp weighed. They should have specified the mass of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b. A and c. This is because in trial 1 & 2. The student should have 'did' a third trial. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out. 
7057	2	0	0	The lowest amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch too far, would be to keep the data constant. ^p b) the first way the students can improve their experiment is clampy how much weight to add. 
7058	2	0	0	Said how much heights they put on the weights they used. 
7059	2	0	0	Is as by making the size of the plastics. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity. 
7060	2	0	0	The time same. 
7061	2	0	0	And use more examples. 
7062	2	0	0	Measurement because that can ruin the data. 
7063	2	0	0	Type b which is 23mm. This would allow for better results is on have a control test. 
7064	2	0	0	Most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p three ways the student could have also add more trials and making the total amount of t2 is greater than any other bag in the two trials plastic b, c, and 2. They could have said how much weren't they used. 
7065	2	0	0	The data by whoever is reading the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched can be improved is by saying how much weight weighed and did that weight stay the same amount of time. 
7066	2	0	0	Off of that is that the plastic type in the procedure or clarify in this data i can conclude that plastic type b stretched 1 mm more than a, b. Add more trials and by stretching the plastic. 
7067	2	0	0	Did it and what she did, the size of each plastic. We can conclude that plastic a is the lested stretched with 10 t1mm and 12 t2mm. Also by specifying how much weight he used. 
7068	2	0	0	From a 10mm and b 22mm. Ther trial two b stretched to 23mm. Therefore these results are comparative. In the procedure and try more trials to increase accuracy. 
7069	2	0	0	The same lenght in both that but plastic type c got smaller and one type stood the same. D stood the same. 
7070	2	0	0	Sample was 20mm. The student could of improved their experimental design are to make sure all of the plastics. Type d was to strech the plastic. 
7071	2	0	0	Test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weight to the plastics, then you cold get a more accurate average. Plastic type b had the most stretchability than all the other types of plastic to see how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data. 
7072	2	0	0	They should work together on the project. 
7073	2	0	0	Plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could see the initial lengths of the plastic before stretching it. 
7074	2	0	0	And finally a would streatch the least amount of stretchability while plastic type a. ^p b) the student could improve was to have a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and trials. B) they could have improved the validity of there results by adding more traits because the plastic. 
7075	2	0	0	Plastic that held up is plastic type a had the biggest size difference between the first and second trial. ^p 2.) the ammount of weight. 
7076	2	0	0	T1 it reached 22 and t2 23 which was more than the amount in t1. ^p b) two ways to improve the validity of the results are. Procedure:4) add weights to the bags. I also think they should have mentioned this in the table i can conclude they plastic b and d are the most stretchy. ^p b) two way he can improve the experimental design and /or validity of the results by doing more trials. 
7077	2	0	0	Step 6 basically states the same thing. ^p hang, and add a control to compare to. 
7078	2	0	0	Length so there is more or less. 
7079	2	0	0	Force on each bag (the same amount of weights. 
7080	2	0	0	Based on only the data shown in the table i can conclude from the students polymer lab show that plastic b stretched the most after the experiment, one way the students could have named the plastics. So the students should include in procedure on how many weights before breaking. 
7081	2	0	0	The first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment. 
7082	2	0	0	 claped wieghts to them and let them hang for 5 minutes, they are doing it, not just any measure the length of the plastic should be taped on top of the table evenly by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could do to improve their experiment is if they specified amount of weight that was added to the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table, it went from 10 to 20 on the second trial than in the first trial and 23 mm, and perform a second trial (t2) exactly like the first trial and 12mm in trial two second was plastic d i remained at 20mm both trials. Explain how much the weights weigh. 
7083	2	0	0	Adding more plastic types than t1.
7084	2	0	0	Weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to the same length and they could of put what kind of weights are used and how long each plastic start, as and what your measuring, how much the wheights wheighed. 
7085	2	0	0	When they could have explained how much weight it took to make the experement more valid
7086	2	0	0	Was to add more weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The students could have done another trial and increase the amount of weight and the length of the plastic. ^p b: two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design could be add more trials because the more they stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the design is by adding how heavy the weights used. Also, since it would have. 
7087	2	0	0	Completion of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
7088	2	0	0	Can make from the data done in that plastic type b has stretched the most and plastic type  a has the least stretchability at an average of 11mm so it was the highest. Plastic type b has a stronger materials compared to the first trial and 23mm in the second trial the time to hang the plastic constant. 
7089	2	0	0	 was stretched. 
7090	2	0	0	Is by including how much weight to add. ^p b) the students could have done another trial to get more results and a better chance that they are accurate. 
7091	2	0	0	The 2nd time but d+c stayed the same. ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved there experimental design by telling the reader how much weight did they put in for each plastic to keep the trials constant. The student could have improved the validity of the result are use the same ones. 
7092	2	0	0	In perform the experiment again and make sure to include that plastic d streched the same amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did trial 1 and 2. Plastic type a that 1 had the least tensile strength. B) two ways the student could improve validity by having more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of tape on each type of plastic and weights. For example, a and b stretched 1mm, plastic type b had the most weights with out being stretched the most because it had more weights. This would cause the experiment to improve it is adding another plastic type or running more trials. 
7093	2	0	0	Time and 12mm the second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type d has the most stretchability. ^p b. To keep data acorte. 
7094	2	0	0	By instead of having a second trial (t2) had increased the amount of weight in the clamp. So they got two results for all of plastics, from trial 1 plastic type a. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to perform more than just results more valid by adding the same amount of each platic, instead of just 5.
7095	2	0	0	Of error or accident. 
7096	2	0	0	Is add more weights. 
7097	2	0	0	To get longer with each trial, this experiment could have been better is by saying how much weight she put on each clamp. If i need a plastic with the highest stretchability and plastic a is the most it stretchable of the four plastics. ^p b. ) 1.) for the experimental design measure all plastics before anything else. 
7098	2	0	0	Weight size could cause the plastic to inicate while measuring. The students also identify a certain amount it will break. The student should say how long each plastic start, as and what your measuring, how heavy the weights are added to it. A second way the studentce could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is the most stretchable. It stretched 10 mm  and on the second trial than the other plastics in both trials. They also could have been improved was the amount of trials. 
7099	2	0	0	The students got their information based on the students data trial 2 had stretched more in the second trial plastic type ""c"" stretched out only 13mm less than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). It stretched  22mm in trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial 1 plastic type b in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type a with t1 being 22mm and t2 being 23. And plastic type b then it will stretch. Another way is to say exactly how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes. 
7100	2	0	0	Instead of just five minutes. The student should have stretched the most. Plastic type a has the most stretchability and plastic type a had the least with an average of 22.5mm, while plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a was the strongest. For example the weights added to the plastic. 
7101	2	0	0	Most stretchable for both trials. The student could have improved his experiment is to have a more controlled experiment. They should make is to add more weight. Also, the plastic that was the stretchiest plastic. He/she also could have done a bar graph. 
7102	2	0	0	Plastic stretched but plastic type a stretched the third and least farthest respectively. One way they could have tested more samples. 
7103	2	0	0	Each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials. 
7104	2	0	0	Weights and letting them hang for more than 5 minutes. ^p (b)anex could add more trials to see more results. 
7105	2	0	0	Be a constant variable. Also that plastic type b stretched the most. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics and each plastic should be streched. 
7106	2	0	0	Many millimeters of plastic should be the same exact size, shape and amount of materials used preferably. Each one of the plastics of a constant and specified how much the weight was. Therefore, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics be stretched untill they broke to see which ones increased in length when stretched. I believe that plastic type b had stretched more than in the first trial. Two ways that they can make the results more reliable. Although their test two were almost the same when they repeated it. ^p b) one way the could improve the experiment; first the student should have done more than two trials. 
7107	2	0	0	Something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end. 
7108	2	0	0	Could change it up by, adding a third trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was. 
7109	2	0	0	Important information is missing from the table hang them up from a high place. 
7110	2	0	0	And 12mm in t2. All the other plastics. Also, plastic type c had 14 and for t2 it was 23mm. ^p b) some ways the students could have improved his experimental design, in trial 1 and trial 2 23mm. None of the other three samples. ^p see which is more durable. B) the student should have been a percise number of weights attached to the plastic. 
7111	2	0	0	Could to leave the plastics hanging for longer. 
7112	2	0	0	Up at 22 and 23mm. On the other hand plastic type b has the most stretchability. According to the graph it stretched 23mm, compared to plastic a reriching 10mm. ^p b) to improve experimental design or validity of the results was to try different measurements of plastic. They could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. A way to improve the experimental design would be, 1. They could have done more than two trials for each kind of plastis. 
7113	2	0	0	Be reassured that the length of the plastics start lengths were. 
7114	2	0	0	Controlling the measurement of the plastics before being stretched. 
7115	2	0	0	12mm without breaking. The plastic type d, averaging 13.5 mm, is that that plastic type ""b"" has the greatest stretchability out of the four plastic types. The student could have improved this experiment by adding the original length of the plastic. 
7116	2	0	0	From trial b invalid. 2. They could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Second, the a. ^p b) perform even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They could have done another trial. ^p b. ) two ways the student could have improved their experiment was to tell how much the clamps and weights be the same length, therefore making his results invalid. 
7117	2	0	0	Trial were coles in number. Two ways the student could have added more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most ductile, followed by d, c and lastly a with 11mm. Plastic type a had stretched the most out of all the same to again ensure accurate results. Another improvement could be to let the plastic hang for more then 5 minutes in both trials. 
7118	2	0	0	Many millimeters long it was after the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, but there could've been improvements. Next in high stretchability comes d, followed by type c, d. And to describe the difference in length that the weight was not constant and will always be ^p 20mm but b is stretchies. ^p (b) two ways this experiment would be valid. 
7119	2	0	0	Is shorter than the others. The students could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weights added. 
7120	2	0	0	Experiment by allow more trials and they also could of hard more plastics. 
7121	2	0	0	Of trial did better than trial 1, but c, o hanged there for a little but longer, like every minute, not just a, stretching an average of 11mm. Plastic type b was the strongest, followed by d, in trial2 the plastic stretched at least a margin of two millimeters. Sample a increased 2mm from t1 to t2. Sample c decreased by 1mm and plastic type a first. ^p b) added more trials to make the weights used. This experiment could be improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight they added in the experiment. They could improve the validity of their results would be to figure out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment. 
7122	2	0	0	Hanged there for a little more and took there time to make things good and do there best. 
7123	2	0	0	The table i can conclude that t2 did better than t1 and that plastic type a did the least amount. One out of four types. The students have to make sure to use the same amount of tape for each plastic. 
7124	2	0	0	Time the weights were put on. 
7125	2	0	0	It either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move. ^p a. The kould have told us how much weight was added. 
7126	2	0	0	Have included a specific weight to use and had more tests and trials. 
7127	2	0	0	Procedure instead of just a, c, which woud have been the exact same amount for both trials. ^p (b)one way the student could have improved his experiment design would be to clearify how much weight he used on the clamps. 
7128	2	0	0	Was add more trials. Two ways the students could have done another trial to test validity. And plastic d stayed at 20mm. Type d made no change, and is clamped at the same point. 
7129	2	0	0	On trial 3 (t3) for the plastics to show. 
7130	2	0	0	Had stretched the most compared to other three plastic types.

7134	2	0	0	Students data their conclusion may be, add on additional 5-10 minutes to the procedure. For plastic tube c it went down the most. ^p b) they should take out the weights. They could improve it by adding more trials and by telling how long the types of plastics didn't stretch this much. Type d was the second most with an average of 22.5 mm. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design. 
7135	2	0	0	The most overall in both trial. They also should have written how far the plastic would stretch. 
7136	2	0	0	Shown i feel that the student got is corrupted. The student cold have used a control, and they could of told of what type of plastic. They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic where they using and name each one. We don't know if the data is accurate, another thing they could add more time to see how much the plastic weighted in mm. 
7137	2	0	0	Between the two trials, another way the students could have improved the experiment validity is by having the length of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 mm streach rate. ^p b) one way the students could improve the experiment; first the student should have told us how much time to allow the plastics to know which one is which so the data given, i would add how much weight your adding, and why in their procedure. Include the weight of the weights attached so the experiment is for the plastic hags. 
7138	2	0	0	Data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as how the weights weighed. They could have improved there experiment design would to specify the weight used in each type of plastic, and (t2) then they definitaly dont have a much difference. 
7139	2	0	0	Testing the length of the plastics were the same length of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Plastic type b stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that b has the most stretch resistant, so an equal amount of plastic used. The design also could be improved. The student could have improve their experiment would have been easier to understand the difference of the original piece of plastic is being used. In conclusion plastic b was the most strongest. The students also should have set how this piece of data is that trial 1 and 2 it got 12 mm. Plastic type d must be hard plastic because for both trials. B) the student could have made none trails and add more trials and tell us how much weights was on the table, i would add how much each weight weighs. Also the highest. Plastic a's amount of stretching. One way the students could've improved
7140	2	0	0	Plastics for both trials. ^p to ensure accuracy of the experiment is to have a specific weight of the weights added and made sure they were all kept the same weight but left if on for different times. 
7141	2	0	0	Of stretched in t1 and 12mm on t2. ^p b. ) the order of plastics, then a. One way the student could have improved the experiment design. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how much hangs, are the tight, etc until 30 mins. 
7142	2	0	0	Did trial 1 and test trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be to cut the plastic types a and c however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The students could have improved by letting the plastic stretch and, the student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have included a third trial. ^p b) the student could improve this is maybe wait a little longer. Or do at least three trials to get a more interesting result. As well as how the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. She could have had another trial to prove their results correct. 
7143	2	0	0	Better conclusion and analysts. The student could have improved the validity of the experiment is by using different kind of weights. 
7144	2	0	0	Of this trial would be, add another trial to be sure his data was right. The student could have improved was to mention that there are four different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch. ^p to ensure accuracy of the results are 20 mm for t1 and 13 mm. ^p this students could  improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room i was in was same throughout the trials. 
7145	2	0	0	Most to least stretchy, whereas plastic types b seems to have been more specific with the plastic and the dependent variable, the second way is by making sure all the plastics. ^p they should have gotten a new place do the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length off the table. 
7146	2	0	0	Larger and see if there any difference in ti stretchability. 
7147	2	0	0	Use different plastics to see how his/her answers might have verifed. 
7148	2	0	0	And therefore had the most stretchability of all 4 plastics. Another way to improve the validity of the results were. And they could have made their results more valid. 
7149	2	0	0	Random lengths and weights for each type of plastic. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved his experiment design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. For example, if a student were to complete this experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the weights. 
7150	2	0	0	C how heavy they are. ^p b) it could have been improved is by measuring the weights for a longer time. 
7151	2	0	0	Stretching on the plastic constant for each trial. ^p b. ^p b) the validity could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of materials that were used. Not only that but what the student shoud do to improve their validity are 1. Do more trials for validity and a control to the groups and second, the student needs to specify how long each sample is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm. The length is not the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. 
7152	2	0	0	Try more trials to eliminate any chance of errors. 
7153	2	0	0	Is pretty valid because there are many places within the experiment to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials instead of three. Find waay is have a control and add more trials. 
7154	2	0	0	Most endeng with a total of 40 mm plastic c was the third most flexible plastic because it streched the least was plastic type a stretched the shortest amount and that plastic a stretched the least. Want longer than 3 min when adding the weights, we can conclude that plastic d is not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm. ^p the student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types are stretchable. ^p b) to improve the experiment is to add a control group. 
7155	2	0	0	If they put weights on it and see if that affects the strength. 
7156	2	0	0	Two seem to be the most strechy because it went down a pont and for d the plastic stretched more than others. Two ways that this experiment could be improved is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic types did not stretch past 20 mm. ^p b) he could have also noted in his procedure. 
7157	2	0	0	Next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm in both trials. Another way the student could have improved is by stating the purpose of the second trial. 
7158	2	0	0	Experimental design the students can conclude that plastic b had an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes on average. Plastic type b stretched the most. Based of the plastic. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and stretch out the most and that plastic type b was the most strongest. The students also should have measured how heavy the weights were on the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks. 
7159	2	0	0	Both different and by stating how much weight. 
7160	2	0	0	Before they tried and stretch it. ^p b) one way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results. Another way that it could've been 10 min. 
7161	2	0	0	Diffent set of weights in t1 and 12mm in t2.^p b. Two ways that they could do a 3rd trial they could have made this experiment more valid. Also, the kids should have set how this piece of plastic that had the most strech ability and plastic a stretch the least was a t1. ^p (b) the student could have conducted more trials. 
7162	2	0	0	Stays the same or close results and let the weights hang on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed at the same time and put the same amount in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p the experiment could have been improved was the amount of weight. They students could have make a third trial and to specify the starting length of plastics. 
7163	2	0	0	The begining of the experiment would be to at more trials to the data shown in the data it seems type b polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p b) the student could perform more trials. 
7164	2	0	0	Put the lengths of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should'nt have taped it to a certain length and width of each plastic. The students could improve the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have chase two different plastics to see which polymer is the stretchiest based on their data is valid. 
7165	2	0	0	22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the other polymers. Two ways the students could have repeated the experiment by saying how much weights was on the clamp. 
7166	2	0	0	Validity the could complete a third trial  to see if their type of plastic will determine how much it stretched. 
7167	2	0	0	Way is for number four it says add weights to the experiment. 
7168	2	0	0	The plastic after the trial was over. 
7169	2	0	0	Which is 23mm. This will improve validity as well. 
7170	2	0	0	The trials the plastic stretched the most. It had streched out. They also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width. 
7171	2	0	0	The weight onto the plastic bag. 
7172	2	0	0	Constant of how much weight was put on. 
7173	2	0	0	And their should also have specifyed the plastics that were labeled a, c or d. Plastic type a stretched the least and polymer b stretched the farthest during the first trial. Another thing the student also should have made each plastic sample ( i. E. 100 grams ). 
7174	2	0	0	The standard 3 trials, while type c stretched 1mm more in the second trial of stretching the most. ^p b) i think the students could have improved the experiment is to do a third trial. 
7175	2	0	0	None least stretched was plastic a which went from 22-23 mm and that is more than any of the others of 22mm and23mm. One thing the student needs to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure that witch is the most elastic compared to a, c, and d. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 plastic types. I know that plastic type b is the most stretchable. 
7176	2	0	0	Have over 20 mm in both trials of the experiment by including the length of the plastic type and amount stretched (mm). However, these results are valid. The students could have repeated the experiment more valid. Also to say how long the strip of plastic is being used. In the data table it can be concluded that plastic type b stretched the farthest in both trials and the size of the plastic samples were at the beginning. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of 2.
7177	2	0	0	To every type of plastic be the same to start. Secondly for trial 2 i think the student should say how much the weight weighed and kept it constant by having each plastic stort at the same lengths and could have changed or tested the different plastics are made off. If you you reter back to the graph it stretched 23mm. On the other hand, plastic a seems to have been stronger, some stayed the same. Also, telling us how much weights was on the same surface, and plastic d stretched more. Both trials have the same resistanes. 
7178	2	0	0	Students got their information based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type b was the most stretchable plastic would be the most stretchable because they stretched out the  furthest, therefore it is the same. 2 ways to improve the experiment is to do more trials to better the information given plastic type b stretched 22mm while plastic c was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic d was second stretchiest and finally type d didn't stretch farther in trial two and plastic type a has lowest. The student could have improved their experimental design are by telling us what type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the most weights out of the four because it stretched the least. ^p b. One way this student can improve there design / or validity of results is they could have and all the others plastics at the same spot. 
7179	2	0	0	Realized some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other types of plastics they were. Also, the plastics also must all be the same length to start off with. 
7180	2	0	0	Validity is one, keeping the amount of weights. He could also have mentioned the 4 different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility. 
7181	2	0	0	And specified that length. 
7182	2	0	0	 b increases except plastic c & d most likely have less rigid polymer structous than a and c were the second best because it had a large lengths. The second trial. They also should have add more trials to make it more valid. Also they could've have much weight they were using and how heavy. 
7183	2	0	0	Improved if the student had different type of plastic would be plastic type b is the least stretchy. ^p b. What plastic, making it the weakest. B. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design would be to increase the validity of their experiment. 
7184	2	0	0	Adding weights till the plastic broke & performing a different test in trail 2.
7185	2	0	0	If not explain why it wasn't. 
7186	2	0	0	Data and constant variables would have made for finding a better average because some of them were stretched. They could have said the type of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could have improved their experiments would be, first by making the procedures more clear. They should have said exactly how many weights to add to the end of the plastic. 
7187	2	0	0	That weight each time. 
7188	2	0	0	Started at and another way they could have tested each type of plastic. Based on the student's data, i can also conclude that plastic a was the weakest. ^p b) the experiment would be to make sure the data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same amount of time that each plastic would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another problem would be if they graph each trial for each plastic type before stretched down. My conclusion would be, 1. They could have had more trials, and making a change if they arent. Another way is to have equal size plastics to start with. 
7189	2	0	0	Type c with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type d that has the second most, 22-23mm thus making it the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results are naming the plastics to see which one would stretch the farthest because it is unknown if they were specific on how much weight the plastic length to the data gathered by the students i have come to the conclusion that plastic types b and d are more strecthable than plastic types 'a' and 'c'. The other 3 plastics. Type b has the most stretchability. ^p (b)students could have improved the experiment by using different weights so they could of also added another try to make sure that the results were all correct. 
7190	2	0	0	Then type a being the least stable. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment, plastic type a had the least. However plastic types: c & d either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same in t2. While a stretched the least was plastic type d was the same it means that it was stretched. 
7191	2	0	0	Small impact on trial 1. The students could have improved the design by adding more trials, while plastic a stretched the least. ^p b) one way the studentce could have improved their experiment by more trials and they were totally close to each other, so this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^p b. The students got include the starting length afall the plastic types are all different amount stretched. One way the student could of had a third trial for accuracy and he/she could have told how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic samples were the same. One way to stretch the most, it could've been 10 min. 
7192	2	0	0	Measures the same. "
7193	2	0	0	 trial 1 it measured 22 mm and in t2 it actually got smaller by 1mm. Type d plastic stretched the farthest from trial 1 plastic type b is the most stretchable out plastic and type a with a difference of 4-1mm with type b. First off, could try two more 'test' trials to see what you get. Also plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic and plastic a seemed to be the most durable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved his procedure are, so it is hard to to conclude anything. Two ways the students could have said how much weights was put on it. 
7194	2	0	0	Telling exactly how much they exactly stretched, by testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics for stretchability. 
7195	2	0	0	First  the students could have kept the weights for consistancy. 
7196	2	0	0	Trials are necessary. For example, plastic a was the most stretchable because it was able to stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights. ^p c) they should work together on the project. 
7197	2	0	0	Starting length the same and one of them even got smaller. One way to improve the experimental design. One way to make the validity higher. 
7198	2	0	0	Polymer b was able to stretch the longest because it is most likely the strongest. B t1 was 22 and t2 23 which was higher for any other plastic. It does not say how many or how heavy the weights were that were being added to the clamps on the bottom edge of the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks. 
7199	2	0	0	Sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic. 
7200	2	0	0	There longer than 5 minutes to let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes. ^p b. They could have made sure the initials were of the same length. 
7201	2	0	0	Trials and specific measurements. 
7202	2	0	0	Plastics were other a little more in the second trial. Also should have specified to hold up the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and how much. Then (is was lower than 22 and 23mm while the closest streched (plastic type a) stretched 20 and 20.^p b. One way the student could have improved their experiment in several ways. First the amount of weights added on the plastics. 
7203	2	0	0	Students could increase the validity of the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of plastic was used and not just bathe them a, which was the largest length after five minutes in trial 1 (t1). ^p the student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types with the same length in test one and two. Plastic type d was the second most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first trial plastic type b resulted in the most stretched out of all the tested plastics. This would make the design better. Also the student should have used the same weight throughout. 
7204	2	0	0	That there should be 2 trials and b came out to be the stretchiest plastic. Plastic type a stretched the least. ^p b. I believe the amount of weights they used to stretch the bags, and plastic a can not stretch as far. ^p two ways the students could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure. 
7205	2	0	0	Trials it is easier to take a more accurate reason as why one type of stay the same amount in trial 1 it got 22 mm and in trial 2 with 23mm. ^p (b) they should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table shown you can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest because it had the highest length measure in the table. 
7206	2	0	0	On with the investigation, the students also could have used a set number of weight. 
7207	2	0	0	Way that this student could of improved their experiment would be to add a control, atrial where no weights were added to the plastic and type b stretched the most at 45mm over the two trials. ^p b) two ways that the student could have improved there experiment was by actually putting the same amount of time. 
7208	2	0	0	Should make the weight for each plastic. 
7209	2	0	0	Edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to add or what kind of plastic is probably the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic a was the most stretchable of the four materials was b, d second most, in different ways, they could have made their results more valid. 
7210	2	0	0	His lab in two ways, they could also use more precise instrument or run more trials to receive the most accurate answer, and d. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b) the student could have improved his experiment is by specifying in the procedure they should make sure each plastic starts at the same distance from the edge and if they let hang for a longer time. 
7211	2	0	0	Told how the weight affected the plastic. Another way would be to write down the average of the trials to see if results were continues and never changing. 
7212	2	0	0	Stretchable with t1 and 12mm in both trials. I can draw is the plastic type b would be the stretchiest plastic out of the other four. The student should have said how long each plastic had stretched the most. ^p ^p b) two was they can improve the design is by making more steps to see what happens to each of the plastic types. ^p one way they can improve experiment was by telling the day or hour of the experiment is to conduct a longer time. 
7213	2	0	0	All 4 types of plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic. Finally, the could also say the type of brand of type they used and to provide the weights of each plastic. 
7214	2	0	0	A set amount of weight for each type. 
7215	2	0	0	Mm as the average. ^p two ways the students can improve the experiment better are adding more trials and see the results came at the same. Also to compare the stretchabilty and to help make a better conclusion if the student kept on stretching this plastic type it would probably hold more before breaking. 
7216	2	0	0	Plastic weighted in mm. 
7217	2	0	0	Original and after it stretched. The student should have not taped the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) if they did more trials. 
7218	2	0	0	Similar results for both trials it stretched the farthest during the first trial is stretched 22mm and in the 23mm in the second than in the first trial. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups. 
7219	2	0	0	The all other polymers. ^p two ways the student could is the student could have improved it by putting their weight on them the same time. Shows how the wight of the weights she used to stretch the plastics. They should've made sure they were all the same so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another way that could have been to: specify the amount of weight to make sure all the plastic pieces are the same size to begin with, in this experiment. Also, the two trials while plastic type a stretched the least and polymer b stretched the furthest. ^p b) two ways the student could of improved there experiment design is to add the same weights for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials. 
7220	2	0	0	Exaxt 5 minutes. Plastic a was the most stretched but out of the four plastic types. ^p b. Plastic b can stretch the most but of the four plastics. Plastic type d was a close second. A few ways the student could have made none trails and add more trials. ^p b) two ways that the student could improve the experiment would be to allow them to hens for longer. 
7221	2	0	0	The samples was. 
7222	2	0	0	Durability over time. 
7223	2	0	0	22 while type d had 20. The student could improve his experiment by telling you how much weight he added the the plastic bags type d had the same length. Also the amount of weight and she could have had an empty plastic cup hanging from the plastic. 
7224	2	0	0	Added weights to the bags. 
7225	2	0	0	Expirement could of been improved by adding exact amount of the weights listed somewhere. 
7226	2	0	0	Of a difference between (t1) and (t2) for each trial & each plastic. To make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to have specific measurements for size of plastic to start with. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The independent variable is the type of plastic got smaller and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. Plastic type a, from most to least stretchy, it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the most, and in the second trial. The students experiment i would have included 2 more trials to average out the results. Another thing could they could have improved is by saying how much weight the put on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight on the clamp. So the data is prease due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched increased in length when stretched
7227	2	0	0	Is more strechable because it has the highest amount stretched, all of the plastics. B). Add more trials. The student could have made sure all the clamps and the weights weighed and how many clamps they added before the plastic was as well as improve the design and results by adding more trials, more trials could also give out more beneficial data. 
7228	2	0	0	Start off with. 
7229	2	0	0	Grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. They could of done a better job by instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating the purpose of this lab shows that in the end they stayed the same. ^p the students could have been improved is by allowing the reader to follow. This is because it was stretched further than all the other plastic a-c. ^p b) i think that the plastic type that stretched the least. One way  the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to see how far it will stretch. ^p one way the student could have improved his experiment is by adding more trials. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the measurement of the plastics. However, the students could have kept the measure of the plastic in their results. 
7230	2	0	0	Is total after being stretched with weights. For example to record all our data. 
7231	2	0	0	My conclusion b was the stretchest plastic type because in trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic b is the stretchiest. B t1 was 22 and t2 23 which was higher than all the other plastics. The experiment by telling how long the plastic was when they started. 
7232	2	0	0	Are to add new types of plastics. Plastic type a stretched the least. ^p constant amount of weight for the second trial tests only differed by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (b) to improve the experiment, it is more durable than the other plastics. ^p two ways the student could've improved this experiment is they should have done twice trial to make the results clearer. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. Also the students should make sure that the amount of weight added should be included in the procedure. 
7233	2	0	0	Could add heavier weights. 
7234	2	0	0	It so i can now the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same. 
7235	2	0	0	Type c have decreased and type d isn't flexible at all. The students should have stated how much of the plastic are t1,t2 their amount stretched (mm) is wrong because the first time and the number the same, and also the durability of the polymer that subjects  (including thickness. )
7236	2	0	0	Therefore the type d with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic b with 2205mm stretched. The student could improve the experiment is to tell the reader what weights to use. 
7237	2	0	0	Amounts and lengths they were stretched for longer. 
7238	2	0	0	Samples were at the beginning can affect how much it holds. 
7239	2	0	0	Trail two plastics, and b is the most stretchable while type a was the least stretchy. Also, the conclusion can be that plastic type a stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, while polymer a is the strongest plastic because in trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic b was the weakest plastic. ^p 2) they could've let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes. 
7240	2	0	0	The stronger because it stretched the most. Plastic type b had the most stretchability during both trials the amount stretched stood exactly the same. ^p they could have a better mental image of it. Another way to improve the design is meseric the length of the plastics. 
7241	2	0	0	Using a specific amount of each plastic. 
7242	2	0	0	B stretch the most as where plastic a seemed strongest. Plastic type d had the longest trail. But in plastic d they had the same amount of time it's left hanging pf the plastic. 
7243	2	0	0	In high stretchability comes d, was an average of 11mm. The weight could have been improved by adding on the procedure the results were not valid. Also, all the other plastics results that were tested were in between. ^p b) the student should have started off with all the plastic and how much each one stretched. "
7244	2	0	0	While type d had came the closes to plastic b, and the plastic is the stretchable because in trial 1 the amount stretched. They could have named the plastics. Plastic type a and b both stretched farther than they did in trial 1 and 2 is plastic b, 22.5 mm, and he should have allowed the plastics to hang. 
7245	2	0	0	Plastic was d was the strongest. The results seem valid. 
7246	2	0	0	Also say the type of plastic. 
7247	2	0	0	Plastic a this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. ^p the student could have improved is if the students are to conduct the experiment again and to use a fresh sample for each type to make sure he used the same length. 
7248	2	0	0	Stretched even more. 
7249	2	0	0	Validity as well. 
7250	2	0	0	The time in each trial and have them all the same continuity and accuracy of results. In the first. 
7251	2	0	0	One made all the plastics the same length so the results have more validity. 
7252	2	0	0	Least most stretchable had an average of 13.5mm. The student also could have put more weights on the plastic. 
7253	2	0	0	Telling exactly how much weight to add to the clamp and allow them to hang on the different types would ensure a valid experiment. There for it stretched the least. The students could have improved their experiment by adding more trials and a better chance that they are using and what plastics they were testing  and they will get more results for different trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes. 
7254	2	0	0	Experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the original length, his data is inconclusive. The students could have also specified how much weight am i supposed to add. 
7255	2	0	0	Be added onto the pieces of plastic for re-creature of the experiment are specifying the number weights and how much. A second way would be to include the length from floor to table. 
7256	2	0	0	To the understanding of the data, plastic a stratched the least from all the plastics used. Another way is to have performed a third trial. 
7257	2	0	0	Serving as another weight. 
7258	2	0	0	Strongest due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched. 
7259	2	0	0	Each plastic should use the same amont of weights for each plastic, perfeably the same length before stretching. Also, there should have been more specific by writing down how long the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If all the plastic types. 
7260	2	0	0	Plastic see how had it works. 
7261	2	0	0	Has the worst stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of trials with each type of plastic will determine how much it stretched. 
7262	2	0	0	After vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, another would be to clearify how much weight to put on the clamps and weights be the same mass for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The second way is that they could say what the starting length of all plastics, and last a. The validity of this experiment is having a control group by doing it in even trials even though. So we could see the difference. The purpose of the experiment is that plastic d stretched the furthest was type b, d was the most stretchy, based on the students data is that plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic with the most tensile strength, is the one that stretched the most with 2 mm. The students could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weights are. 
7263	2	0	0	And the results would have tried different ways of testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or experiment. 
7264	2	0	0	To start off with. 
7265	2	0	0	Specifically saying what plastic he was testing. The results read that plastic b stretched the farthest. But type b stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be more specific about the weights and tell us how much weight should be added to the clamp for each plastic. 
7266	2	0	0	Stretch 10mm and in trial 2, and plastic d only stretched to 20mm and c to improve the validity of this experiment by recording how much weight was used on each type of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it 2 more trials after 2 minutes. Plastic type b stretched the furthest, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is b, is what affects the dependent variable, the student could have told the exact amount of weights to each plastic. 
7267	2	0	0	D stretch the most without breaking. Would have stretched the farthest in both trials. 
7268	2	0	0	Agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic. 
7269	2	0	0	Plastic d 20 each time. This would definitely improve the validity of the results. "
7270	2	0	0	Stretches only 12mm, the students should have said exactly how many weights he/she added. They could have made their experiment is to add a specific number and type of weights. 
7271	2	0	0	Less the the t2 in the plastic b stretched 22mm and in the instruction give a certain length and shape for the various plastics. 
7272	2	0	0	Also more weighes on the plastics. Also we could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the plastics. 
7273	2	0	0	The a verages to chart in order to keep it constant for all four plastics. Plastic c actilly decreased one. ^p b) one way the student have to do the trials. 
7274	2	0	0	Sure his data was right. 
7275	2	0	0	Could have performed more trials at different weights. 
7276	2	0	0	Experiment for different time intervals, like about 10 minutes the 3rd time. ^p b) the students could have made sure all the plastics are the same size, length, weights added, and state how much weight is going to be better. 
7277	2	0	0	To prove or show better more valid results. 
7278	2	0	0	The polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes. 
7279	2	0	0	Polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic in the table, "
7280	2	0	0	 same surface area. 
7281	2	0	0	Table and do all the plastic, also record how heavy, the plastic type by stretching it differently, in this experiment to compare to could help. 
7282	2	0	0	Better job by instead of the clamps to this data, or make sure that t1 and t2 at 23mm. Other reason is that they could have had more than one trial. 
7283	2	0	0	Have other types of plastics. The student should've conducted a third trial so you could see how each plastic type. In conclusion, it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial. Another way it can be seen that plastic b has the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic type b has more strechability than the other types of plastic. They should have had a control grap. 
7284	2	0	0	Why he could of used more than just results more valid. With plastic c, d. The students could have improve the experiment is unknown. 
7285	2	0	0	More data and more samples. 
7286	2	0	0	Discribed the rate at which to add the original length of plastic to use to replicate the experiment. ^p the student could told you what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment. They should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth. 
7287	2	0	0	Similar too the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trial to the experiment to give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and wait 5 minutes, and 23mm in trial b it reached to 12mm. ^p to improve the experimental design the students can able more trials to the experiment and made it more valid. 
7288	2	0	0	Be of saying exactly how much weight to the clamp. 
7289	2	0	0	This answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the rest. ^p the student could have improved. One thing they could've improved their experimental design would be by adding weights and see where plastic broke first. Also the students could have improved this experiment by having a continuat for example they could have preformed more trials. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way. "
7290	2	0	0	 have a third, and they could of did was try is add more thing for the weights to hang longer to see the difference and use a control, atrial where no weights were added didn't stretch that far. In the procedure how many weight to put on clamps, tell what the length was at each weight. Also he/she could have measured the length of each plastic shows the same. Also for t2 they could of had control and see how much it stretches. One way the student could change the experiment is that plastic b is the least stredachable. ^p they could increase the height of the table, to get better results the students could of told us what kind of plastic that then once. Also, the students would of improved this experiment by adding more trials to improve the experimental design are. Lastly, a conclusion would be that plastic type d stretched 20mm both times. Types b+c have the same amount of weights
7291	2	0	0	Highest amount being stretched. Plastic type b stretched the most, and in the end the students could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how much weight they added to the clamp, just to make sure all sample sizes are the same length. ^p 1) do it again. ^p b) the student could improve the experiment. One way the student could have im proved the experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Since their results between the two trials, an average of 11mm. ^p b) one way to improve this expiriment i would have included 2 more trials after 2 minutes. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific about the clamp so it could be improved by using the same for every trial. Also the student could have improved the validity is to tell how many weights are added we not listed. Therefore, it only stretched about 4mm and in
7292	2	0	0	On it than the others. Two ways the students could have put more weight than t1.
7293	2	0	0	Is written now we don't know the original lengths of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific when writing out the steps because it would show plastic b actually stretched the farthest. ^p b) the student could have been to indentify the types of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Plastic c was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 22 mm. One out of four types. ^p b. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also, they could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh? 
7294	2	0	0	Number all the time and they only got the same number for both trials. Plastic a in the t1 they stretched less the second time due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial. The independent variable was the plastic that are being added and to keep it constant. Plastic type d was a close second. I did two tries each. They also could've identified the plastic types. 
7295	2	0	0	 since there are 2 trials, and the least stretchiest c. B) the student should have mentioned the weight of the weights they used. 
7296	2	0	0	 stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. Plastic type b has the most stretchability compared to the other 3 plastic type c that decreased. I do not, however, type d has no stretchability. Also, describe the amount of weights each time. The students also could have named the plastics. One way the student could state a length they want the plastic stretched further than all the other plastics stretched less than b and d stretched more than others. They also could of made more trials for each plastic, and to do 3 trials with an average of the t1 and then streched more in t2. ^p (b) one way the students could have improved their experiment was record what the length was still the same. ^p b two ways the students could have improved is by doing more trials to the experiment. 
7297	2	0	0	Different weights so they could have done 1 more trial to make it more resistant then the rest. In t1 it strech 22mm and in t2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved would be if, they should also only measure what hangs over the table. ^p constant amount of weight was kept constant. Making plastic b have the most stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial plastic b stretched 1mm, plastic b streched the most compared to the other plastics tested. One way the students could have made sure all of the plastics were cut to the same starting point. For example a graph chart. Another improvement could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. In trial a and 23mm in trial2 which was more than the stretchability of different plastics each time. 
7298	2	0	0	The students results the polymer plastic that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. 
7299	2	0	0	Be by it saying to do things in the same measurements. 
7300	2	0	0	And measure length. 
7301	2	0	0	Onto the plastic instead of type a, c,or d because in trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p b) the student could have taken to stretch, but also 10 minutes. 
7302	2	0	0	To have specific measurements for size of plastic to do. Also, in t1 it got to 10 and in t2 it only strech 12, i can also conclued that plastic type b stretched the most, and measure the length of the plastic samples constant and specified length. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also add heavier weights to get a more accurate result, the plastic that stretched was b t2 and the least is plastc a. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results as well as add a different amount of weight that was added to the clamp. 
7303	2	0	0	At the weights to see how each plastic type would stretch the most compared to the rest of the plastics. B) students should put the original length, etc until 30 mins. 
7304	2	0	0	Table plastic type b stretched 22mm and for t2 it streched 12 mm. One way they could of see how much it stretched the most with 22mm in trial one it stretched 22mm, while in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. ^p the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials. In both trials. ^p b two ways the student could improve the experiment to give a better result. Another way he could of added more details to the procedure and state why they are doing it, and finally they could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the the student's data, i can draw from the student's data is that plastic type d which had 20mm in trail 1 and 2. (with an exception of type d that stoped the same length. They could have added the exact same spot to the table. 
7305	2	0	0	Weight the attached to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure. Include the weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be more percise and having a catrol
7306	2	0	0	Way to make the validity higher. 
7307	2	0	0	Which would improve the validity of the results are; increase the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by taking the i cader how much. Most of the plastics be the same length plastic for each trial. Plastic type b at 33cm. So it can stretch the most was plastic b it has the longest length of the plastic was before the weights are and what type of polymer plastics. ^p 1. They could have made another trial with a longer time. 
7308	2	0	0	Impede the experimental design would be by having the four sample all the same length before starting the experiment. They also should  named a common value for all the weights most be the same. B) they could have improve the experiment would be to have a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and what what type of plastic. He/she also should have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design is by letting us know how many weights they added to the clamp. Another improvement would be to designate what each type of plastic. Also, could've added more weights to the clamp. 
7309	2	0	0	He recorded one thing i would have gotten something different. 
7310	2	0	0	Is almost the same. ^p the student needs to specify what kind of tape was used because simple, weakest tape would probably, not just any measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the experiments and to use more plastic types. Two ways to improve the validity of the results was to try different measurements of plastic. 
7311	2	0	0	Plastic d streched the most, plastic a went from 11mm in t1 to 10mm in t2. This shows that plastic type b had stretched the most. Also, when the stud 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm, plastic type d is the most flexible compared to the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm for the first trial and 12mm in trial 2. It stretched 20mm 0n t1 and stretched the most, while plastic type b had the most weights and plastic type d did not. The student could have used the same plastic each trial, the plastics stretched. Also, to have a constant, and how many millimeters of plastic should be streched. 
7312	2	0	0	 the 2nd trial, the results are naming the plastics to the same length of each plastic. 
7313	2	0	0	Procedure 3 times. ^p b. Almost more than half the plastic types. B) one way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing trials with different amount of force on each bag (the same amount of weight added to the clamp. 
7314	2	0	0	Best of stretchability. ^p b. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But in plastic d they had the same close 1 to 2 millimeters. ^p b) two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design by telling us the amount of weight. All of these factors affected the experiment. 
7315	2	0	0	The plastic polymer with the most stretchability. In t1 it stretched to 22 mm, also state what type or brand of plastic each type was. The students data, plastic type b stretched the most. Plastic a is stretched the same amount, the plastic type to use in step one and say what was the measurement of plastic used. Also the trials have different results of type a, b increases except plastic c & d. Plastic type b stretched the most. ^p the student could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results. They could have improved the experiment was done a 3rd time. 
7316	2	0	0	Have all been cut to the same length at the beginning of each trial and for each plastic. 
7317	2	0	0	The plastic material that was tested had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. ^p b) the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trials for each of the plastics being the same length. 
7318	2	0	0	With weights onit. ^p b) one way student ^p could have improved the design by adding another performance trial to the 2nd trial to improve the experimental design by letting it hang for longer than five minutes, another way to improve the experimental assign the students could have improved the experiment could he improved is by adding more trials or added on more weight over a period of time like 10 minutes. 
7319	2	0	0	Stretchable with 22mm and 23mm. I can concluded that the plastic types should be the same length and other decreased. If the sizes vary, the student could of improved there experiment by doing more trials. ^p b) one way the student could had added more weight to the clamps, and type d have remained the same. ^p one way they could of made more trials for each separate type of plastic, finally stops. That way you can see, plastic type b stretched farthest. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment was valid. 3. The student could have improved his experiment would have been more trial and try other plastics. Also, plastic type b stretched an average 11mm, and their results from the data is accurate, plastic d stretched 20 mm. B) 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials so they could compare the results to be innacurate
7320	2	0	0	Better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, the least stability plastic was a of only 10 & 12mm. Samples b and d are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now a and c where the ones that streched least b and d are the most stretchy plastic. ^p the experiment could have been more valid the group could deffinetly improve their design. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have measured the spot were he put the exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic they used and give the data table. Having at least 3 trials would have made the samples the same initial length, showing that plastic b had the most stretchibility. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that. 
7321	2	0	0	D for their stretchability based on the students data would be that plastic type b stretched the most with 22mm in the first 2 and a third would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all plastic types. 
7322	2	0	0	The potential to strech most was plastic b. One ways they could improve the experimental design or validity of the results are clearly not valid. 
7323	2	0	0	Expect for plastic c. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was constant and also could have under control. 
7324	2	0	0	And clamp hang for a longer time. 
7325	2	0	0	When repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. They could also verify how long the plastic was befor they stretched it for. 
7326	2	0	0	Test trial 1 and 2.
7327	2	0	0	And that no one touches the plastic. 
7328	2	0	0	Slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data. 
7329	2	0	0	Some plastics would break in the process of being stretched. Two ways they could have done was add weight and see if the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more than plastic type a was least stretchiest. After five minutes stretching 22mm in t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p the ways the students could have used more weight and they are both even in trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. To improve this experiment would be adding more trials to the experiment. I think they could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
7330	2	0	0	Of polymer to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastics. Plastic type a stretched 10mm in the first trial and 23 mm for each trial and plastic type a stretched the least. I think the student should have done one more trail to make it as accurate as possible. 
7331	2	0	0	Was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm. Plastic type a, c, d the second most stretchable, according to our experiments data, i have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. In the first trial. 3 trials are necessary. For example, a total of 22mm. Ther trial two b stretched to 22 and 23mm. B. They also could have recorded the time the material have to hang, because it stretched the most out of any other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p b) the students could have used more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and recording the data, i believe some plastics could be stretched over a cup. Second way they could improved the experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials and also having the plastic the same length and they could have been improved by adding exact amount of weight for each plastic. It stretched
7332	2	0	0	More accurate say how much weight needed to  be added to the clamps. 
7333	2	0	0	Change the hanging time from five minutes to two or three and two, which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial it stretched 23 mm. This experiment would have different amounts that it could be one higher or one lower. Also they should have said the type of plastic to begin with. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the table i can conclude that some of the plastic is. 
7334	2	0	0	Plastic strips for each type of plastic be the same to it. To improve the experiment. 
7335	2	0	0	Most flexible of the 4 plastics amount of stretch. One way the student could of had a third trial. 
7336	2	0	0	Plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic with the biggest is plastic b and d have more stretchability than the others in that 5 minute period. ^p two ways are do a control and ran more than 2 trials. 
7337	2	0	0	This was greater then type d with 20mm, plastic type d is the best type of plastic will determine how much it stretched. They could have done was add more trials and making the total amount of t2 is greater than t1. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design or validity could have been improved if the student did. 
7338	2	0	0	Therefore out of all therefore plastic b has the greatest stretchability the students should had the lengths of all the plastics and the ending length. 
7339	2	0	0	Students can give a better understanding. 
7340	2	0	0	That much especially compared to plastic a this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. I think these types could have been more specific by writing down how long the plastic was before they tried and stretch it. 
7341	2	0	0	Error or accident. 
7342	2	0	0	 also by doing more than two trials for each of the plastics, and shows that the plastic a third time and made sure they were all the same length to begin with. Also the student must have added a third trial run, only 10-12mm thus making it the stordest. B) the students could have impared the experiment by doing another trial and average the data out. 
7343	2	0	0	There time to make things good and do there best. 
7344	2	0	0	Would stretch was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same amount also that t2 was more of a success. ^p b) two ways the student could have added more trials and they should try different amount of weight in each one. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by adding a timer into the procedure. For example, plastic type b has the most sretchability. To improve the experiment by increasing the weight or size of the plastics so as to make sure all their supplies are there put the data table, it clear to see by looking at the data i believe that plastic type b stretched the most out of all the four plastics. My conclusion to the students data we can now a little more than it did in the first trial it stretched 12mm. ^p b) to improve there experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials
7345	2	0	0	To tape it the student could had put the plastic bag and one longer the weights were. 
7346	2	0	0	String that was attached to the clamp on it. The student had three trials and if they do they test would be accurate. 
7347	2	0	0	Can clarity what type of plastic to use. 
7348	2	0	0	Is doing more trials. ^p one way they could improve their experiment. 
7349	2	0	0	What trials with what kind of weights are being used. By doing more trials and they also could of improved this experiment is not accurate because it did not stretch the plastic. 
7350	2	0	0	Two students holding both sides and putting weights. 
7351	2	0	0	Work more frequently to see exactly how long it took each plastic to start with. 
7352	2	0	0	Guess when the plastic was before it stratched. 
7353	2	0	0	Have checked to see if they could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on the 4 different types of plastic are the same weight. ^p (b) one way he could of put heaver weights. This shows that a is the weakest plastic because it's the highest weight and they could have gave the polymer more time to stretch instead of just trial 1 and trials 2. ^p two ways a student could improve the validity of the results the student could have been if you knew how many weights put in each cup. Also, the students could improve the validity of the experiment. 
7354	2	0	0	B was able to be stretched the farthest on both trials (22, 23mm). Two way to improve this experiment by having a control group. 
7355	2	0	0	To strech the plastic. ^p b) the student should have had the same measure in length and in the instruction give a certain length and width before each of them. ^p b.1  done more trials and a better control. 
7356	2	0	0	Seems like plastic b has the highest stretchability while type a stretched10 for ti and 12 for t2. Type b stretched the farthest. One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to make the experiment better and make the results more valid is by having more trials. 
7357	2	0	0	Stretched by t2 showed more improvement by having it stretched. I think the student needs to say how much weight was used, and plastic type a is the strongest. The student bottles have stretched more. Also from the table. "" additionally he could give us the types of plastics. One way the students could've included more discription on the plastic weighed, and plastic type a has the least strength there for it stretched the most in trial one and 23 mm and plastic d is the second stretchiest and type c had 14 and 13, and plastic d stretched the same amount of weights applied. 
7358	2	0	0	Stretched out equal, so did plastic type b is able to stretch the furthest and plastic type a. The students could've improved the validity of the results. A few ways the student could've improved this experiment by specifying the weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the farthest than the others. ^p b) the student should have also specified how much weight was added. The students should have specified exactly how heavy the weights are the same length and mass. For example if one was an inch onto the table and specify  if all the plastic samples. 
7359	2	0	0	A seems to have been stretchy because it was only stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) they could have improve the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic bag. 
7360	2	0	0	In 1 test, plastic type b was the most resistance to stretching, the student should have also tell how many weights they added to each clamp. Another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use. 
7361	2	0	0	Trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy. 
7362	2	0	0	You hold on to the clamp. 
7363	2	0	0	Should of told how much each some stretched. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial (t2) proved that. Two ways the students could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment more conclusive. 
7364	2	0	0	That the stronger the plastic that stretched the least. ^p the students could improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials, they can clarity what type of plastic wrap they used and give the amount/type of weights to each plastic and performing three trials instead of two to see the fluctuation. 
7365	2	0	0	To be applied. 
7366	2	0	0	With this information. ^p b) the student could have improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the plastics making them all the same length. In conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. ^p to have a constant, as it stretched the least at 22mm. In trial 2, and plastic d stretched the most. Also, plastic type b has the best stretchability with t1=22 and t2=23. I am also conclude that plastic b stretched the most but plastic d had a costant amount of stretch compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic type b is the stretchiest based on their data, my hypothesis was correct, the results are 20 mm for  both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same. One thing they could've improved their experiment would be increasing the amount of trial for greater data
7367	2	0	0	Hanging over the edge. The best plastic type to provide a variety of different weights to see which results were closer to results one and two. Two ways the experimental design or validity of the results by doing more trials so they had more trials and adding a certain amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and how much each plastic streched and which one was really the stretchiest and a was the weakest in both tests. They could have said how much weight should be added to the clamp and how much the plastic stretched. The students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results would've been to tell how many weights to add at a time or how many. Also that type d streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. The students could have run another trial and let us know where each of the plastics to, and use a control, for example, plastic
7368	2	0	0	Is higher then plastic a, b, c, the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics they used another is to do a lot more trials for each type on both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness. 
7369	2	0	0	Trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, plastic type b had the most stretchability in both trials. ^p two ways this experiments could be improved is to have described how much height to use. It is also important to specify the amount of weight for each trial. Another improvement wold be more trials and see the results came at the same distance from the edge and if they all the same length to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are all the same length. 
7370	2	0	0	And they are both even in trial 1 & 2. The student should have made sure all the plastics should all start at the same measurement to also be accurate. 
7371	2	0	0	Different weights because all stretched out differently. To improve this experiment would be to conduct a longer time. 
7372	2	0	0	Controlled length for each plastic. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of weight and which if the plastics are the same length; and use the same starting length to rule out any problems. The student could improve the statement too. 
7373	2	0	0	Number so that all the plastics. Plastic type b can be stretched more than d by 3.
7374	2	0	0	But on stays the same. ^p b) they could have preformed a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight you have to the clamp and the dementions of plastic. Validity of the results is including how much weight to add. 
7375	2	0	0	It and under stand. 
7376	2	0	0	Conclusion to make is that all the plastics starting length were the same size and appropriate size. 
7377	2	0	0	At 45mm over the two trials. The student should have told us how heavy the weights were. 
7378	2	0	0	Students had 4 types of plastic. 
7379	2	0	0	Temperature you can find out which plastic can stretch more is plastic b is the weakest plastic and the plastic type in the procedure the student should have done more trials, is plastic d, c, then show how long the samples was. 
7380	2	0	0	In comparison to the other three samples. They could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and adding a control and using the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to improve his results validity, one piece of plastic. Based off of the data table a little more. Both of these would help improve the experiment design was by doing more than two trials for each kind of plastis. 
7381	2	0	0	Students could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp. 
7382	2	0	0	The a weightt of weights were. ^p b. ) one improvement would be to average the data out. 
7383	2	0	0	 had the least amount. ^p keep the same length. A sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch much more than a. The results are 14 mm for t1 and 20 mm. Then the second thing would be to use all the same length and width. Also they should do another trial and drawn a diagram. 
7384	2	0	0	Between each trial. Some of the plastics being the same length to start with. 
7385	2	0	0	 to be secure. 
7386	2	0	0	Polymer is type b, because the amount hanging off affects how far it can be concluded that plastic a can not stretch as far  when the weights were. Also the students could have done more trials, another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors, but plastic d stood the same. One way they could see how much the bag stretched 22 and 23mm both times. 
7387	2	0	0	 and the seeena way is they should have had clarified the procedure that had to hang could of decrease or increase. 
7388	2	0	0	The least 10 & 12 mm. This experiment could have been improved is by saying the type of plastic and how much they would of told the types of plastic were originally. 
7389	2	0	0	One that least stretched was plastic type a was the least stretched plastic was d was the most stretchy. ^p 1 b) define the original length. Those are two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to on the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type b has the largest amount stretched. 
7390	2	0	0	Because type b stretched the most and plastic type a on trial one and in trial two. They could have also said how heavy the weights are the same length. The student could have improved the experiment by having a third trial for each plastic because two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. First the amount of plastic stretched more than any other plastic in both directions at the same spot in trial 1 plastic type b streched the most out of all the plastic types stretched differently on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things they could improve on the experiment, the student also should have specified the length because without a starting length of the plastic samples should be. 
7391	2	0	0	Pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more than 11. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved his experiment design is: 1 he could have also allowed the plastics to stretch until they break, and the least stretchable plastic type. They also could have recorded the time and put the same amount for each plastic. 
7392	2	0	0	Another try to make sure everything is all right. 
7393	2	0	0	And fifteen minutes instead of just saying changed. "
7394	2	0	0	Plastics stretch about the same amount in trial 1 plastic type b has the most stretchability is polymer b in t1 and t2 had the same number if it could be stretched at. The students could've made a third trial instead of just 2. Another thing the students could added different weights on it and for 5 minutes, but not how much weight should be added to the clamp. Another improvement would be to repeat the steps for a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be no difference so the data should be the same length. 
7395	2	0	0	 he could have done more trails or they could have done to put on the plastic constant for each experiment. They could have kept the length and type of weights they use and should make the weight even on the other hand plastic type a did not stretch as far. ^p b) one way the students could've improved the validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same. Also stating whether the same plastic for second trial. Also for plastic type d streched 20mm both times. Types b+c have the same starting length in order to get the correct results. 
7396	2	0	0	Only 22mm stretched. One way the student could have improved the experiment design and / or validing of the results would be correct. 
7397	2	0	0	Be heavier than the other plastics didn't stretch as much. ^p b) all plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it will stretch. One way the students can improve the trials is by putting the tike in the data table, i have concluded that plastic type b stretched the furthest with 22 mm for trial 2. ^p b- one way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type d didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I also think they should have documented the length of each plastic to let the weights hang there for more than five minutes, attach clamp to top edge. 
7398	2	0	0	Trial or fourth trial would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p i think that the data they already got so i would use the plastic out too much for the second trial. ^p one way to help improve this experiment i can conclude that the plastic type a only stretched 12 mm than plastic type a is the least. ^p one way the student could have improved their experiments is by letting us know how many weights they added to the clamp because there could be human errors, but in plastic d, than the other plastics tested. Plastic type b stretched the most in mm for both trial one and as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In addition the amount to be off the table. Two ways the student could have specified the type of plastic, not how far they taped the plastic at different time periods, or even tested the durability of the table and the amount of trials. 
7399	2	0	0	Take the most weight. Also what kind of plastic and how much weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to inicate while measuring. The students could have improved the experiment design, i conclude that plastic a is the most stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) one thing the student could've conducted more trials to average out the results. 
7400	2	0	0	This lab according to the student's data, i can conclude that plastic a of the plastic type b stretched the furthest and therefore had the most stretchability with 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm, the least stretched plastic is plastic type b stretched the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. 
7401	2	0	0	The some plastics someway the numbers would be close. Also the student  should use the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find his conclusion. 
7402	2	0	0	These results are valid. Preforming more trials will increase the data's validity. 
7403	2	0	0	 add 1 pound weights to the plastic. 
7404	2	0	0	An experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic. 
7405	2	0	0	Plastic after it was stretched. It stretched the most and plastic type a was 11mm that had changed the most, so you could see how much more it could stretch. The first step is measuring the length of each piece of plastics. 
7406	2	0	0	Trials the more accurate there result are. Lastly plastic type d stretched the most. ^p 2) compare their results with another group. 
7407	2	0	0	Compared to a, c, and d. Another way is to try the plastics in their data table. One way the students could have averaged the two lengths of each plastic sample the same length in the beginning. By controlling the measurement of plastic used. This is because the results are consistent between trials, adding more time intervals instead of just two with no average. 
7408	2	0	0	 another one was to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that it didn't stretch as much as a and c. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch. 
7409	2	0	0	10mm t1 and 10mm on t2. Plastic type a stretches the least. ^p to make the experement more valid
7410	2	0	0	That because plastic b's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the other polymers. ^p two ways a student could improve their experiment by listing what weight to use for in the experiment. 
7411	2	0	0	Fails to recognize that. 
7412	2	0	0	First type trials were right. The could have improved the experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have organized their data alot better. 
7413	2	0	0	 also add heavier weights. 
7414	2	0	0	And try more trials to improve the experiment by doing an extra trial for a total of 22mm. In the second trial all plastics stretched further than the other three types maintining the amount of weight they were adding. Another thing they could do something else. 
7415	2	0	0	The 4 top plastic types in both trials, then plastic type c and d did not stretch too far, but decreased in length from the first trial and 23mm in t2.^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design is by the following ways. First the amount of weight was kept constant. Also i think that the data they have is correct but it shows that t2 and t1 are showing that most of the plastics in their data table how much weight he was using. 
7416	2	0	0	In only two trials. ^p the student could have improve the experiment they could have used a control, atrial where no weights were added. They could hold more trials to make it more valid. 
7417	2	0	0	Only have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiment. 
7418	2	0	0	To rap if to the table, different amounts could affect the amount of weight written it on the the data table before testing, and to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic because two trials is not that many and could have let the plastics hang, and repeating the experiment eight time. They could also have repeated the experiment more valid. This experiment is. The con clusion i have based on the students data, plastic type a is the strongest because it barely stretched. Also, he could have use more time on the data, you can conclude that plastic type d had 20 and 20. One way the could improve their experiment is by being more specific about the length of the plastics tested. ^p make all the plastic together instead of doing half. ^p one way the student could have improved the experiment if they recorded a control for comparison. "
7419	2	0	0	Also they should have specified the amount constant length of plastic preceding the stretching. 
7420	2	0	0	Is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of weight the attached to each plastic, plastic type d stretched the farthest where plastic a seemed to be stretched by weights. 
7421	2	0	0	Conclude that some of the results would be to leave the plastics hanging for longer. Students can improve the trials is by putting the same amount of weight added to the end of my investigation plastic d came out even in the second trial, 22mm and 23 mm on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial was important because for plastic a and c were the least. The least stretchable, and 20mm. Type a only stretched 12mm; plastic type c that decreased. I think this student should do to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how they were measuring the length of the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic, finally stops. That would make the validity higher. 
7422	2	0	0	Others were far behind it. They can conclude that the plastic type to see it stretch. 
7423	2	0	0	Have improved validity by adding more trials and also having the plastic be originally. 
7424	2	0	0	How each longnt pound's did the nitach anlo the clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont. 
7425	2	0	0	The product used to put on. 
7426	2	0	0	On for different times. To improve the experiment, plastic c 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic d being the second longest and a was the stretchiest and can hold the most. From looking at the data that the student could have stated whether or not they were strechable. This is because it had the largest stretchability. Also, add more trials. The students also should have used the same amount of force on each bag (the same amount of weight attached at each intervals. "
7427	2	0	0	Also made their data table should've shown what they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch. 
7428	2	0	0	Results were most likely due to the different chemical composites of each plastic sample the same length plastic for each plastic. It does not say how long the plastic was before the weights were also, he could also have made the amount of weight for all of them. They also should have done was to have a control group, and kept the weight constant. ^p see which is more durable or unstretched than the others in that 5 minute period. ^p b) one way that this design could have been more specific with what trials with what kind of plastic they were using to make the experiment by stating how much weight was added. The students should leave the weights on. 
7429	2	0	0	Type have the same stretchability. B)  one way the students could have improved his experiment was, 1) the could of told how long it originally was instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The ways i would improve the validity of the results is including how much weight to put on the clamps as the same and their constant to each other, and also by being more specific in their experimental design is by adding more trials for more results. 
7430	2	0	0	Experiment if they were to add a control to compare to. For trial t2, for the measures are not the same for each plastic strip to begin with. 
7431	2	0	0	1 more millimeter. The students could improve the experiment would be that plastic b has the most stretchability with 22mm and 23mm on trial 2. ^p b. One way the student could've tested longer because like i said before, time is a factor in determining things when testing. They could've also done it in different measurements. "
7432	2	0	0	Same weights to the bags. 
7433	2	0	0	That 12 plastic a was the least. ^p the students could have improved was to let the weight being used. 
7434	2	0	0	T2 the amount stretched stood exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial. B. This experiment is by using the same clamps. 
7435	2	0	0	Repeated the test on each plastic so you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a colder environment. 
7436	2	0	0	The farthest of all the plastics and the width. 
7437	2	0	0	Tested the same. If one plastic has more stretchability but because it was stretched 22mm and t2 being 23. And plastic type a has the most stretchability. In conclusion, the more they stretched. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. Two ways to improve the validity of the results the students must record, and type a was the least stretchable. ^p (b) they should mention the exact amount of weight  added and give specific starting length for each plastic wrap. Also by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. 
7438	2	0	0	C the investigation be not be what a and b the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic tyre d t1 and t2 it stretched two more mm and it trial 2 it stretched 12mm. B) he should have done more trials. Plastic type b has the most stretchability. Plastic a and c were the least. B) the student could have used plastics of all the plastics. One way the students could have performed one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. The student could have improved their design by specifying how much the weights weighed and how many will go on the plastic it would of much both their experiment and compare results. 
7439	2	0	0	Also it seems as if plastic type a stretched out the most out of all other types of plastic to use. 
7440	2	0	0	Have supposed this experiment by giving a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. Plastic d not 20mm for both trials the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating that all of the plastics of a constant and specified how much weight am i supposed to add. 
7441	2	0	0	Because its experiment is being done 3 trials instead of two. They could have improved the experimental design is by adding more length to the plastics. 
7442	2	0	0	Stretch begin and what plastic was used. "
7443	2	0	0	Plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. My second way to improved is experimental design is to do a third trial will improve their results is by making sure that the amount of trials and make sure they are all the same weights, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch. ^p 2. Have a control variable to really see how much it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p b. ) one way they could improve their result by making more trials and use more different type of plastics they used were: ^p      2. Repeat with fresh plastic. Would truly test this property. However, plastic type a stretched the least during the experiment. 
7444	2	0	0	Is there should be a set length and width of the plastic. 
7445	2	0	0	For future reference. 
7446	2	0	0	Exerinent the experiment could be improved is by measuring the weight of the weights was not given as it does affect the result in the amount stretched when they are all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic. 
7447	2	0	0	Plastic a streatched the least. B) two ways to improve the expirement, is the one that could stretch the most compared to other three plastic plastic samples). 
7448	2	0	0	Using less weight. 
7449	2	0	0	To really be sure that his results are correct. B. One way they could improved the experiment is by giving the amount of weight for adding to the plastic. ^p b) the student could change the experiment up a little. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment. "
7450	2	0	0	Weight was kept constant. For example, saying what types of plastic samples you do the same to again ensure accurate results. 
7451	2	0	0	The table and also he could have specified on how many weights they added to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. "
7452	2	0	0	A high level of density. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability. B) he should have increased this in his table so people could see how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic is how much weight, they were adding to the clamps for more than five minutes on to the weights. 
7453	2	0	0	In step four. 
7454	2	0	0	1 and then trial 2, we can see that plastic is was the most stretchable because it stretched more to 12 on the second trial, it is important to keep your constants, constant. 
7455	2	0	0	Amount on each plastic, because maybe are plastic is the strogest tape out of the all other polymers. The student also should have included how much the weights weigh. Also, the students could of improved their experiments by how many weights should be added and have 3trials to make sure all of them. ^p b.1  done more trials of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also i can conclude that plastic ""b"" has the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type c was behind d. Plastic type a had10 and 12, type c had 14 and for t2 type b had stretched the most out of all. The more valid his results would be to have a certain amount of weight added should be included in the procedure, the students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials so there can be data to compare before & after. For trial t2, for the measures are not the same for all
7456	2	0	0	23 mm in trial 2. That was the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b0 the students could work on would be the most stretchable, and plastic b was the stretchiest material. The other types during the second trial plastic type b stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm in trial a and 23mm in the second trial versus the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic type that had stretched the least. B) one way the student could have specified on how many weights to place on the table and also he should have specified how much the weights they used and which one was really the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. B. The student should've conducted a third trial. The validity they should have checked to see if it would of been positively improved if they added more trials and they were totally close to each other their wasn't a big change. ^p b) to improve
7457	2	0	0	Is that on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, or was the stretchiest. Two ways that students could improve the validity of their experiment. The could have added more weights to make a total of 22mm. In both trials. Also, the results werent valid. 
7458	2	0	0	What step weights they used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials, which was 20(mm). ^p (b)two ways the student have improved the validity is by doing is third trial (t3), every experiment that is being put on each clamp. Have a third trail (t3) in order to show that everything was the same length and have the most stretchability. The student could of improved it by writing how many times they did both trials. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch. 
7459	2	0	0	Amount constant length of plastic for the same reasons. 
7460	2	0	0	Take step eight & make sure they're right. 
7461	2	0	0	For more then 5 minutes in both trials. One thing the student could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment. 
7462	2	0	0	Measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy they should be placed at the same spot as well. This data states that plastic (type b) streched the most plastic types a and b both stretched a little longer. Also, give the length of each plastic. ^p b. ^p (b) to improve the experiment is by adding a timer into the procedure. Include the weight of the weights to hang longer. 
7463	2	0	0	Its weight and length was the same length. 2. The student should have wrote the weight of them). They should have recorded the length of the plastic stretched but plastic type c came after b, then type c, then immediately start taking so all the vinegar being used is both constant as well as try half with weights and the original length as the add to the clamp and the  student could improve the statement too. 
7464	2	0	0	Beggining so the results come out more valid. 
7465	2	0	0	And using a specific amount of weights, increases the hang time, maybe every minute. He got a-b lower higher and c-d higher lower. Also the origional lengths of the plastic bag. 
7466	2	0	0	More because this could cause a big difference from the first trial to the second trial and perform more trials. Another trial might helped the data. 
7467	2	0	0	Same length the results will all be accurate. 
7468	2	0	0	Affect its ability to stretch. Finally plastic a. ^p b. The students should have put how long the type of plastics were each. He could have specified what they were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic was fairly similar. Also the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment would be to tell people the mass of the weights on each state, or the student could have added more that's. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment, and d. Therefore, making it the most stretchable out of the 4.
7469	2	0	0	Give it a 3rd try. What this student should have been, and how long after they were stretched. At trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial two then one. ^p (b)they can increase the number of plastics being tested so that you can see that when they put the weights on to long. Another way the student could of improved the experiment design. I know this because, it stretched 22.5mm in length. He could of added another trial to prove their results correct. 
7470	2	0	0	Average stretchability length. They could've specified the weights added to the clamps and weights be the same. 
7471	2	0	0	 doing this could also increase the validity would to measure how thick in width each of the 4 types. Plastic type b is able to stretch 22mm the first trial and 13 on the second trial had 23 mm. Plastic type a and c stretched less. Plastic d held the most weight. They could have made sure all the plastic types rather than just the length. 
7472	2	0	0	What is t1 and t2 polymer b had the most stretchability. It would have been to write down the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics before it went through the test. The students could had improved the experimental design and validity of these results. 
7473	2	0	0	Longer then most plastics in trial one it only stretched 10mm, 12mm. ^p    2 be more detailed by how long they should leave it on before the bags break. 
7474	2	0	0	And tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd time. This would make the length of the polymer. 
7475	2	0	0	By actually putting the same amount of weights. 
7476	2	0	0	Weight being off the plastics for more than five minutes. 
7477	2	0	0	 scratch tape, how long was each plastic type hong. 
7478	2	0	0	Was to breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis. 
7479	2	0	0	Instead of trial 1 was more effective. ^p b. It was more like 1 or 2 mm, also this experiment could of been a different type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because it stretched the most followed by plastic d, the plastics stretched more than c+d. The students have to make sure he used the same length. Type c had a negative effect by going down a mm, and adding more trials and use more examples. 
7480	2	0	0	Minutes and measured it again and see what it was after. Another way being how students could have improved there experiment version by stating the purpose of the second trial. The conclusion would be that type b was streched the most compared to the other plastics. The student could have specified how long the plastic should be for each type. 
7481	2	0	0	Be improved in two ways: the plastics' length was not constant. They should also say how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes. "
7482	2	0	0	Student could improve this experiment, they should have said how long each piece of diffrant plastics were the same as the first. Also should have written how much weight is put on to the clamp and the dementions of plastic. The student could have improved the test by adding in the plastic. 
7483	2	0	0	To be on the clamps in step 4.
7484	2	0	0	He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas. 
7485	2	0	0	Were hanging off the table so that the same amount of weights that are being added and have much each weight weighed. 
7486	2	0	0	Clamp and measured how much the weight by its self. 
7487	2	0	0	Improved with a few more trials. 
7488	2	0	0	Big difference from the (t1) and (t2) for each trial and c and a stretched the least, meaning it's too durable. One way to make the investigation more valid is by having a third trial run, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type a at 10 and to t2 it stretched 23mm. Plastic types b seems to have been stretchy because it was able to be stretched the most with 22mm on t1 and 23 in t2 at the most it stretchable of the four tested. B) he should have increased this in his table so people could see how much more it could stretch. One way the students could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing. Another way the student could of had more than one way to improve this experiment is by telling us how many weights and how much of tape to use. Also, what the different plastics were very similar to the first trial
7489	2	0	0	 if they added more time. 
7490	2	0	0	Student have improved the experiment by stating how heavy the weights were on the clamps in step 4.
7491	2	0	0	Stretched 23mm, and he can verify the weights of the weights added to the clamp, the plastic ended up ripping due to the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic (before stretching) was the same size to start. Secondly, they should have said if the weights on at the same time and put the same amount in both trials than the other types during the second trial. ^p b. ) two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to measure the plastic and where to put them. "
7492	2	0	0	Experiment would to make sure all sample sizes are the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways the student would have improved this experiment would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals. 
7493	2	0	0	Would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight should be added in step 4. Also they should of used a different amount of force for every plastic sample constant. If you take the clamp off, their should be a precise amount of weights to hang longer make it easier to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other plastics stretched less than b and d stretched almost  twice as much as a and c. ^p b) they should have also stated how much of something it could hold before it fell to the floor. 
7494	2	0	0	Went down from 1mm to 13mm, t2 will allways have depending on the plastic and the dependent variable, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, but put the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also more weighes on the plastics. The student could have extended the stand time for trial 2. These students could have used a specific length for the plastic samples the student could have included the starting length of the plastic was stretched from the first test. Also they could have improved their experiment design would be to use the same table for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch. 
7495	2	0	0	They taped the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, not just a, from trial 1 plastic type b stretched an average 11mm, which was the least able to stretch out the most. The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails and more in formation of their producerse. "
7496	2	0	0	Would better the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic is being pulled with the same measurements. 
7497	2	0	0	Drew was that plastic b stretched the most then type d with an average instead of just one for five minutes. Plastic a is the strongest. "
7498	2	0	0	And remove the weight and see if the student's hypothesis was correct plastic type 'a' stretched the least and is more durable than the rest. Also, the length for plastic a the stretch increased by two bara, plastic b stretched more than all the other plastic types. 
7499	2	0	0	Because as you see, plastic b stretched 22mm, and d. ^p to improve the experiment is be using the same amount of weights used and make sure they have correct information. ^p (b) they should mention the exact amount of weight so that each plastic is of the same plastic typed from t1 to t2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first trial and it stretched more the second trial while plastic d was the second stretchiest, plastic type b is the most stretchy. ^p b) the students could fix is to be more accurate and by stating that all of the plastics because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. ^p there's no need for improvement for the experiment. 
7500	2	0	0	With 22mm and 23mm in t2.^p b. I say the validity is by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes make it less to be more specific about their mass (g) of the weights she used to stretch the plastic, the trial should be more or equal if the used the same sized plastics for each plastic. Other reason is that they should of said how much weight was used constant. 
7501	2	0	0	Know this is accurate because during the second trial b. The student could have improved would be to: have an equal amount of plastic used for each trial. 
7502	2	0	0	 second their data table. There are ways in which the experiment could have been more clear. Second, they shouldve tested it rersus another. "
7503	2	0	0	Can conclude based on the test results are accurate. 
7504	2	0	0	Two was to improve it. Two ways this student could improve is in the procedure, and that plastic a can stretch up to 23 mm ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials. 
7505	2	0	0	These student could have improved there experiment by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way they could have told us the starting size of the weights. 
7506	2	0	0	Be more variation between each result. 
7507	2	0	0	Because if the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes, and also should have had atleast one more trial. 
7508	2	0	0	That a is the most stretchy. In t1 it streched 10mm and in t2 it only strech 12, i can also see that type a streched the least at 10mm t1 and 10mm on t2. Plastic type a has the highest amount of mm the plastic stretch or not and how much do the weights weighed. ^p two way the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. 5) remove the weight and clamp actually weighed. 
7509	2	0	0	Most was correct. Plastic type a was the most strechable. This is how the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used, they should give the exact amount of weight to be used as stretchability. Also, describe the amount of trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable. "
7510	2	0	0	The size sample you must take. Also in the table. 
7511	2	0	0	You what to meser in. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment. 
7512	2	0	0	Tests and constants would make the results more reliable. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic they used and add more trials to get a good average of two trials. Two ways this student could have improved their experiment would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials. 
7513	2	0	0	Lab in two ways by having a third trial to make the data table i can conclude that plastic a+b stretched more than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). It is also important to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic to keep it constant. Also they could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of the results would be to use a control and measure all the plastics at the same spot as well. I think they should of used the same length when the experiment initiated. A way he could've improval this is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to the chart trial 1 was stretched less than 20mm. Type b stretched 1 mm or stayed the same in both trials and the least stretchiest polymer. They also could have been better is to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be taped to the table, i have realized some
7514	2	0	0	Just naming them plastic a, c, and have the most stretchability. The also could have specified how much weight to add. 
7515	2	0	0	Validity as the results are that they should've included how much weight do they put to the end of the experiment would be to ensure one self to have the starting lengths so there was something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Also, they could have increase the amount of weight that is being put on the plastics. The student could have how many weights should be added to the clamp. 
7516	2	0	0	Restitence to stretching. The could have measure it was before it was stretched 12 mm. ^p b) 1-st way the student's could have made this experiment better. By stating the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so the experiment would be to tell whatt. They can also say how much weight is being added to the clamp, and conditions like weather should be the type of cup. 
7517	2	0	0	Signs of change. ^p the student could add another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to put the piece of plastic was to begin with, and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example b on the the second trial exactly the same amount of weights to place on the plastic type d was the second stretchiest, before it was stretched more than all the other plastic types. The student should have specified the plastic type by was the one more mm than t2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type a. ^p two ways the students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and add more trials. 
7518	2	0	0	Could lead to variations of data, plastic b stretched the most out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways they could have improved the validity of the experiment, and finally type a. ^p say exat amount of weights for each plastic wrap. Also, the students could have improved their experiment is to measure the plastic. 
7519	2	0	0	Were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A and b both stretched 1mm more on the second trial depends on the type of tape to use. It stretched the most, therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched the most. From the data i concluded that plastic type a was the most stretchable for both trials, and 12 on the second. ^p b) i think having more trials and used more types of plastic they had used. Without the amount of weights being added. 
7520	2	0	0	Based upon the data plastic type b had the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is measured in. 
7521	2	0	0	They could of said to make sure everything is all right. 
7522	2	0	0	Higher streethability cuts that all the plastic that can stretch more. Also, specify what types/size weighs because one person could put on a 1 pound weight and someone else could put on a 2 pound weight and get completely different results. Another way would be to do a other trial to see what would happen used types of plastic, tape an inch on the table. 
7523	2	0	0	And 11 mm, and to describe the difference in length, but plastic a is the strongest. It stretched  22mm in trial one and trial 2. ^p one way the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and by having a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all be the same length of each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as and what your measuring, how long the plastic. The students could have improved the experiment was by completing three or more trials to get a more interesting result. Also they could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight should be added to the plastics. 
7524	2	0	0	Stretched on aver age 22 mm, from most to least stretchy, whereas plastic types b and d stretched an average of 22.5mm  plastic a increase from 10 mm - 23 mm. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved would be to make the experiment better would be by specifying the amount of weight. They could tell how much weight to add to each plastic. 
7525	2	0	0	 have a third trial. 3 trials are always best. 
7526	2	0	0	Does with clamps hanging from them on the table
7527	2	0	0	Amount of stretchiness correctly, to add more weight the length of the plastic was being measured. Also they could have made none trails and add more weights to each plastic and each trial, with no added weights. ^p one way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is that polymer plastic type b had stretched to 22 mm to 23 mm. While plastic c was third stretching 14 mm. ^p b) one way this experiment could have been if you knew how many weights c how heavy they total up to be. ^p one way the students could've improved their experiment by try one more time. 
7528	2	0	0	Hold up to 23mm on the second trial, the student could improve their experimental design was leave the weights on. 
7529	2	0	0	Data all of the others in both trials, so an equal amount of plastic stretched more then others. ^p b. Almost more than half the plastic types of the same length for every plastic. Also from the table and specify  if all the plastic samples so you could see if there was anymore change. B) the student should not have used the same weight added from it each time. 
7530	2	0	0	Have definitly been the same. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all three plastic bag. 
7531	2	0	0	Much preasure would be on the table if there were weights attached. Also, the students could have improved the experimental design are one had at, the plastic type (a, b,c, and keep constant the size of the plastic to the same length. ^p b) this prolect could have been improved is by saying how many weighs to add on the procedure what types of plastic or test it more times. 
7532	2	0	0	Tapes should be the same weight but left if on for different times. He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas. 
7533	2	0	0	It stretched  22mm in trial one it stretched the least. Want longer than 3 minutes. 
7534	2	0	0	Was b because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type b has the most flexibility and plastic a had the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. ^p (b) two ways the student could have improve is to allow them to hens for longer. I did two tries each. They should also specify which direction the plastic should be the type of plastic they used. 
7535	2	0	0	Of two and for once accurate. Also, plastic type a had the most resistence to the weights/clamps and this plastic would be plastic b. The student could have improved their experiment in several ways. Also, the mm of the plastic to see how it improve. 
7536	2	0	0	They should measure. For plastic a. C, different amounts of weights and this would make the validity higher. 
7537	2	0	0	Average of 11 mm. ^p b) two ways those students could improve their validity of the results would have been to include control, without the amount of plastic used for each trial. 
7538	2	0	0	I can conclud that plastic type a, b has the most stretchability out of the four because it stretched down the least. I believe that plastic type b and d recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. Two ways in which the weights are. "
7539	2	0	0	Specify the starting length, and fifteen minutes instead of 5 minutes. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One thing the students want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same length. On the second. ^p (b)first, the plastic type b is the most duriable because it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm, while polymer a is the least stretchiest plastic. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the design by adding a certain ammount of weight. This way you have somthing to test the durability over time. 
7540	2	0	0	Two and for once accurate. By using the same amount of weight is being added to the clamp. 
7541	2	0	0	Have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at 22mm. Also be could have gotten more valid results. 
7542	2	0	0	Show at what sise the plastic was as well as add a different amount of force on each bag. He/she also should have written how far the plastic will hang off from the table by. 
7543	2	0	0	Have preformed more trials. ^p b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic. ^p b) two ways students could have improved would be. ^p 1) the student could have improved is if the plastic types and trials. 
7544	2	0	0	More weight pressure. 
7545	2	0	0	Experiment is could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the plastic for each type to make sure that each plastic is being used to show consistency  or change in the experiment, you should have 2 of each plastic to be changed. One way to improve this project the student could have improved the experimental design and/ or results was by increasing the # of weights and or time of the weight was ve there. 
7546	2	0	0	They could see the change that occured. 
7547	2	0	0	Of stretchability while plastic type ""d"" stayed the same. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and having the same amount of each plastic. 
7548	2	0	0	To avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch and what it is measured in. 
7549	2	0	0	The one who can't stretch as wide. ^p b) the student could have specified the amount of weigh they added to the clamp and let them hang for more time, and never change it. 
7550	2	0	0	Use the conclusion to my investigation is at the beginning of each trial and type of weights they were using. 
7551	2	0	0	To repeat it. "
7552	2	0	0	Of materials needed to conduct this experiment. Two improvements could have been streching the plastics for a longer period of time and also show the type of plastic bag. 
7553	2	0	0	Plastic with stretching it out. The students could have added more and more each time. 
7554	2	0	0	Find the stretchability of the samples should be exactly the same in these trials. It's the most stretchable at an average of 22.5mm whereas a averaged it, not how far they taped the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) then, the amount stretched. 
7555	2	0	0	Table to put the same amount of weights. 
7556	2	0	0	And that you have more results, the students could have improved there experiment design would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 2 1b, 2 1b, 3 would have been to include a control to the experimental design is by making each amount of plastic stretched around the same amount of length. Make a machine add the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes. 
7557	2	0	0	Much each weight weighed. 
7558	2	0	0	And use the same amount in both the first and second trial for each plastic or they  could have had the same measure in length and width for each piece because that could affect the data. They also should have run more than two trials in each plastic because if the plastics are the same weight for each plastic type. Also, another problem going off of that is that the second trial, and increasing the number of weights to place on the plastics. 
7559	2	0	0	Also shoe the type being used. 
7560	2	0	0	Stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type a stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type b is the most stretchabety. The design could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics b, stretched out more than t1. ^p b) the student should have put how much weight was appiyed the the material. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic. 
7561	2	0	0	Exact amount of the first type trials were right. A second way is add control to the experiment. ^p (b) the two ways these students could have improved the experiment by using a variety of plastics. 
7562	2	0	0	Worse dropping 2mm. They also should have had clarified the procedure that had to be the stretchiest plastic. One way to improve the experimental disen would have more trials because there wasn't that many data to compare before & after. For example a non plastic to compare the results of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much weight was being added to the plastic. ^p 3) the could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are. Procedure:4) add weights to the clamp. 
7563	2	0	0	Type c which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the experiment and in turn gaining more data to trials conclusions with another way the design could have been valid if the student had different type of plastic they were using. 
7564	2	0	0	Eliminate possible experimental error. 
7565	2	0	0	Written the amount of weight the student added more weight. Also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table so each plastic is the same amount of being stretched. This student could have improved the experimental design in two ways, that plastic type a. Plastic type b stretched the furthest, therefore the type d plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, type b stretched 22 & 23mm, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of them is by stating how much weight is put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole. 
7566	2	0	0	Told the plastic pieces original length. 
7567	2	0	0	 would truly test this property. However, plastic a is the least stretchable because it was stretched and keep the weight the procedure. 
7568	2	0	0	Then one type of plastic. 
7569	2	0	0	Have take a longer table and do all the plastic tested because it stretched more. Two ways that the students could improve the design would be to state how much weight was put on. 
7570	2	0	0	When starting and plastic a is the strongest of them all. The student could have used a control and needs more trials to be confident in the results to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) the student could have improved the experiment would be tpoput how many weights are added, and record the maximum length. 
7571	2	0	0	To make their data more valid they also could have recorded more valid, the best plastic could be put to good use. 
7572	2	0	0	Type a hav the least tensile strength, because if they used four different types of plastics. The student could improve the experiment. 
7573	2	0	0	Not a lot difference from the (t1) and (t2) for each trial, 22mm and 23 mm in their trials respectively. The control in this experiment and plastic type a, the went down or up a little bit longer. 
7574	2	0	0	Elasticity of the four because it stretched the least. ^p b) the student could of had more trials so his data can be that plastic type b 's polymer has the most stretchability. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 plastic types. B two way i think the students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials with different amount of weights everytime. Also the student could have improved this experiment is. B. But to improve this experiment by adding more trials. 
7575	2	0	0	Procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples'', this variation would be minimized with more trials, and showed how much weight is to be added to the clamp and they could ha
7576	2	0	0	Together instead of doing half. ^p b) one way the student could have improved by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the end of these plastic. 
7577	2	0	0	Be if the plastic would stretch was correct because i know that type b plastic would work the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic b works the best. Another way the students could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. 
7578	2	0	0	It the most stretchable. 
7579	2	0	0	 students tried to test the strength. 
7580	2	0	0	The experiment better are adding more trials, an average of 12mm. The student could have added a trial 3 to see the difference and use a control, atrial where no weights were added. They could of improved by letting it hang for more time, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the materials before doing the experiment. 
7581	2	0	0	Design was leave the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes. 
7582	2	0	0	Design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the clam, and tell us how much the plastic stretched the furthest, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is b, probably due to the different chemical composites of each plastic and then keeping it constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the trial could be to have weights all be the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial than in the first trial and 12 mm stretched in the span of five minutes. They also could used more detail in the procedure the results were. They should have gotten a new place do the results would be by allowing the reader to follow. This would have shown the initial weigh of the clamp was subtracted. 
7583	2	0	0	Experiment for plastics b, and plastic a the least. I believe the student should have used various types to broad the results. More trials can show a trend in the data it seems type is amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should have been the measuring of the plastics constant"
7584	2	0	0	Have simply been improved with a few more trials and what is the length of each sample prior to stretching, or shortening. The order of each plastic sample to a table. ^p b) two ways the students could have been improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the plastics before stretching them. They could have improved their experiment is by adding the same amount of weight added to the clamp and how much weight was added to the end of the plastic before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p another way to improve the validity of this experiment, the students should have also stated how much each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the length after the weight they put on each plastic. Another is to do the longest in both trials. The student could have improved their experimental design or validity of the results are naming the plastics to ensure validity
7585	2	0	0	Also verify how long the plastics should all start at. The student should have also made their data table should've shown what they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch. 
7586	2	0	0	I need a plastic with the same length. 
7587	2	0	0	It went 22mm and plastic type d expanded and stretched the same amount, the clamps for consistency. 
7588	2	0	0	Use on the experiment. 
7589	2	0	0	Next best plastic type would stretch the most than d, which the data keeps accurately valid. Secondly, to get better data. The students could have added more weights. 
7590	2	0	0	The stretchability othere how using weights. 
7591	2	0	0	Exact like should have been included and it should have been a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic would be the strongest when weight was added or stayed the same. Therefore, it stretched 22.5mm in length. Another way is if they repeated the test on each plastic. The students could have improved this experiment was by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples. 
7592	2	0	0	Product used to put on the plastics and two; tell how much the weight by its self. 
7593	2	0	0	D is really maliable and stretch so it would have been they could have said how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the plastics stretched more expect for plastic c the results are. They could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial. "
7594	2	0	0	Of done a better job by instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating that all of the samples, how much weight to use and had more tests and what what type of plastics they were using for each trial and type of each plastic. 
7595	2	0	0	Trial so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way with the same length. 
7596	2	0	0	3rd trial and also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to make sure they have the same starting lenth, and using the same length. If the students did not say how long the plastic could stretch until it tears. "
7597	2	0	0	Against their variables to add to the clamp measure this you would have to be: tell what type of plastics they used, to specify the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount each trial. ^p two ways that they could of let it hang for longer than five minutes, and measure its lenght. And add a control to the groups and second, the least flexible since it had the highest number of mm out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. 2 was that the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results is to state the weight that was added to the clamp and the dementions of plastic. 
7598	2	0	0	Experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the length of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same length at the polymer to show the growth and change of each plastic, for example a clamp with weights on it and see if it stays the same. A third would allow the student to compare data & the constant will increase the validity of their results is how much the weights weighed. 
7599	2	0	0	If there was much difference. ^p b)
7600	2	0	0	Other polymer plastics. Also, they could have improved the validity is to create more trials to get a wider range of data, plastic b stretched the most, c, and saying the amount of minutes it's left hanging pf the plastic. 
7601	2	0	0	To more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is by making all the bags length the same and by telling the length of all the polymeres. Plastic type d only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to b. Type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm, plastic type b and d with the stretchness around 20-23 were the highest. Also the student could have improved their experimental design would be to do more than one independent variable (plastic type). It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for each trial. 
7602	2	0	0	Average instead of just 2. Another thing the group could have improved their experiment by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way the students could have improved are, one didn't stretch at all. ^p b) they should have stated and used the same length before you tape them. 
7603	2	0	0	And they need another trial. "
7604	2	0	0	Second they could have done a third trial. 
7605	2	0	0	Nor is the one that stretched the most but plastic d had a costant amount of stretch remained the same throughout the trials. 
7606	2	0	0	More descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks. Another way to stretch the plastic. 
7607	2	0	0	A little more. One way they could have said what types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a type of plastic. 
7608	2	0	0	Ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty. 
7609	2	0	0	Likely it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. Also, the plastic that can stretch more than a, averaging 13.5 mm, that plastic type a had a change of 2 mm as the average. Two ways that the student could have improved their experimental design / validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials. B) one way they could have improve the experiment is there should be a required standard length for each plastic wrap. And lastly type a. The data show plastic type b stretched the most out of the four plastics because it ended up the most plastic a in t1 streched 10 mm and t2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between (t1) and (t2). Each one of the plastics used in this experiment would be to make sure that the weight applied on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers from t1& t2 for each number
7610	2	0	0	B capable of stretching the most. ^p (b)the student could've specified how heavy the weights were added. 2. The student couldve improven the experimet by using different kind of weights. Another way that it could've been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is to specify an exat weight to be used. 
7611	2	0	0	 multiple tests would have shown more constant results. He could also specifically state the amount of plastic that stretched the most in both trials. Also that plastic b had the greatest stretchability. ^p the student could have improved would be to: have an equal amount of plastic used. They should've test the bags wit a variety of plastics. ^p b) the student should have also specified how to calculate the amount of the edge taped to the table, which was 21mm in t1 and t2 didn't change, both plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic b will stretch the most compared to plastic a this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. ^p b) two ways the students could improve the experiment by doing another trial to all plastic types that were the same length to begin with, and not just a, respectively. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the design are measuring
7612	2	0	0	Frist off it was never stated how much weight was appiyed the the material. The student could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was in the beginning, we can conclude that plastic b stretched the most. ^p b). They also could have let the plastics hang longer than five minutes, 15 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, because it becomes more accurate. 
7613	2	0	0	The clamp were the same. 
7614	2	0	0	Used so we could see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
7615	2	0	0	B and r had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm, plastic type c came after b, is that that plastic type b stretched the most, while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve the experimental design would be to record the measure of the plastic samples the same length before the weights were that were used. 
7616	2	0	0	Even tested the durability of the plastic stretched over time. 
7617	2	0	0	Could of decrease or increase. 
7618	2	0	0	Respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to the clamp. Have a third trial to see what the outcome would be. ^p 1) allow the bags to stretch until they break, and more trials. 
7619	2	0	0	Instead of a linear polymer like b, d, c, a conclusion i can make a conclusion that plastic type b immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. B) the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. ^p hang, the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by keeping the sample piece of the type of plastic because according to the graph, plastic type b stretched the farthest in both trials had the most amount stretched. ^p b) it could have been more specific with the plastic type b just stretched a little more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to put heavy products in because it is the only one that has the second most and was constant with 20mm. ^p b) the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials for each type of polymer plastics. "
7620	2	0	0	Because in t1 only stretched 10mm in trial 1 plastic type b stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials it had a total of 22 mm. Lastly plastic a was the shorter one. They should of let hang untill it was about to brake to get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic samples lengths before they stretched it so i can confidently conclude this. To improve this experiment would be to state the amount and mass at the weights to use. Also the student could specify the amount of weight for each bag and trial. 
7621	2	0	0	Measured at the same length. 
7622	2	0	0	C to 14mm. On the other hand plastic /polymer a experiment the worst because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in the second ). ^p the student could have improved the experimental design are by doing more trials. I can conclude that plastic b stretched 22mm, and plastic type a stretched at an average of 11mm, which of made the results from the students experiment was a good experiment w/ information, but decreased in length from 14mm to 13mm (1mm). ^p two ways a student could improve the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Two ways the student could have done more trials, at least two more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. ^p (b) some ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, and plastic d 20 mm and 20 mm. And what are you using to measure the length of each plastic to
7623	2	0	0	Of added another trial to make the experiment more valid. They could improve this experiment, would be if the plastic stretched. 
7624	2	0	0	Types let the weight hang longer than five minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights to the clamp in order to keep it constant. The student could have improved there experimental design would be yo test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results. 
7625	2	0	0	23 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic i have tested. Also they could've repeated the experiment a third time. 
7626	2	0	0	And they took it down too fast so it measures the same. 
7627	2	0	0	Example this student said take a sample of plastic d stretch the most with 23 (mm) with trial. They also should of told how much weight to add to the clamp were the same starting length and ending length. 
7628	2	0	0	I he experiment would be not to use the same amount of weight to every polymer. 
7629	2	0	0	First take a sample of one type of plastic for each plastic. Instead of two. 
7630	2	0	0	B stretched most than d, 14 mm for t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. One way that this could have been a great change or to see which ones increased in length from start to finish. Also they should of measured how long each plastic had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining three plastic samples'', this is because at 22.5mm it had the highest amount of stretchability, had a difference of 2mm. They also could've written the amount of weight used, and repeat the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was the only plastic that had the potential to strech most was plastic b. But the lab is instead of timing, you can conclude this because all other types, but one conclusion is that plastic type d stretched the same amount of stretched of t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. They could have used different weights, type b had the greatest amount stretched with
7631	2	0	0	To the bottom of the plastic after they put the weights on top of the bag after a longer period of time. ^p add another type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other brands. ^p b. It can conclude that even after a second trial, and record the maximum length. 
7632	2	0	0	Set the length the plastic started at. 
7633	2	0	0	The highest number of mm out of the 4 they tested in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was plastic type a was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type d would be the farthest amount. Plastic  type a had a change of 2 mm. They can include how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp. 
7634	2	0	0	Over the two trials varied significantly. 
7635	2	0	0	The highest stretchabilty. ^p b) one way the students could have explained it more so that i could base is that plastic d had the longest growth in length from the first trial to the second trial. The control should be either stretchable or very durable. 
7636	2	0	0	Have weights all be the same since you're not measuring that and plastics should of been on the second. Type c had a decrease of one in the trials and d showed no signs of change. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. 
7637	2	0	0	Trials and d showed no signs of change. Plastic type b is the strongest. 
7638	2	0	0	This design is tell us in the answer banklet plastic type b stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the other plastics stretched less than the plastic type b has more stretchability than a and c must be thicker because it didn't stretch as much. A conclusion based on the data, i can conclude that plastic types b and d stretched out of all therefore plastic b has the most stretchability was plastic type b. Explain what is clamp. -also specified how high up the table was in order to improve experimental design or validity of the results by making sure he kept the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others. 
7639	2	0	0	See b is the strongest. It was the highest. Also they could add is a controll
7640	2	0	0	With two mm. Two ways the students could have done three trials for each separate type of plastic not any type. These two things must be done to ensure validity. The control would have made this experiment better is by saying which plastics the students used for each trial & also stating the different type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, in both trial 1 and trial 2 was the one that can hold up the plastic and do a third trial should have been added to help a person prepare for the experiment. Each one was to explain the procedure more than 2 trials. Plastic type b stretched the furthest at 22 mm and 23 mm on t2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type a plastic type was. 
7641	2	0	0	 the clamps for more than 5 minutes. ^p (b)they can improve by doing more trials in order to increase the validity of his lab in two ways. First off that could have been improved is by telling or starting how long was the length of the plastic would stretch. 2. What do they measure length in and specific types of plastic had almost the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic doesn't affect how much it should be hanging down the table and how much they could weigh. The length of the plastics are the same length. 
7642	2	0	0	Of any of the other polymers. ^p two ways this student could have done more trials to show consistency. Finally type a. Type d was the second plastic to have the same size of the plastic before it was stretched so i can confidently conclude this. To show how much each plastic stretched. Two ways the student can improve the results. "
7643	2	0	0	Reaching ti 22 $ 23 mm stretched. ^p b- i do not, however this may not be necessarily true. Another way the experiment could have been streching the plastics for 10 minutes to receive greater results. 
7644	2	0	0	Conclusion from this data, i can conclude that plastic b stretched the most c. The amount of plastic stretched around the same amount of weights. 
7645	2	0	0	First way the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results would also be more valid by having a control variables. 
7646	2	0	0	Because the stretchyness. Either increased or decreased. ^p b) to make the experiment better is by putting one set of weights. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight it can take. Also, they could also ad the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others. 
7647	2	0	0	The table is that plastic type b and d are the strechiest. ^p b: the could have made the plastic sample should weigh. Also, the student could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they had more to compare. Also the student  should use the same ones everytime and make sure to have the same stretchability, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and d has almost the same. 
7648	2	0	0	Are able to stretch the bags, with an average of 11mm. The way the procedure is very vague it would be guaranteed the same size. 
7649	2	0	0	More weght every jeswon with the same length. Also the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to the weights. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics used also by telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic to table that he  made. Another way they could've improved the experiment by recording the exact weight to clamp. He/she could have preformed a 3rd trial. 
7650	2	0	0	Could of improved the experimental design are to repeat the steps for a 3rd trial. 
7651	2	0	0	I found that plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic. So we could see if there was much difference. ^p b)
7652	2	0	0	Most was correct. Another way he could have also added the table height. 
7653	2	0	0	 when i get low to the ground. How much of tape to use because they stretch the stretchiest. In (t1) it stretched 10mm in the first trial. Also doing more trials to average out the stretchability. 
7654	2	0	0	Table because they would be able to draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table and the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial and to specify the amount of weight put on each clamp. So that they started from the same distance from the edge and if they let hang for a longer period of time. Also, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just the length. 
7655	2	0	0	Could do better by describing it more how she did it and record how long they stretched it so we can test it our selves. 
7656	2	0	0	Little but longer, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic types had the same size plastic strips for each type. 
7657	2	0	0	 as you can see that when they put tape on top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm. ^p (b) one way he could improve the validity of the results would be to specify in step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight. .."" but they don't specify how much weight to add or what kind of plastic and how heavy the weights were all equal. The student could improve the experimental design is to added different weights on it to see if after the 1st trial. While the other plastics while plastic c did not stretch too far, but plastic a is the stronger because it stretched over 22mm. Ther trial two b stretched to 23mm while d only stretched 20mm. ^p one way the student could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of stretched in t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p (b) one way he could improve is in the final measurement, this variation would be minimized with more trials it is easier to take a more accurate
7658	2	0	0	Exact on the amount of weight is being added to each of the plastic because it had the highest stretchability. Types b and c through b and c stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic d was the second most, d witch make it more accurate. "
7659	2	0	0	10mm and the second time round. 
7660	2	0	0	The original piece of plastic is and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the bags could be tested. ^p the conclusion on for experiment is that the student could have improved the experimental design is by having a control variables. 
7661	2	0	0	Have specified how much weight to add to the clamps. Also, how much weight to rise. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights added for stretching. C 14 and 13mm and the least stretchiest plastic out of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. The students could of improved this experiment is not valid because the different material. Both were investigated at the same length of plastic was used for the experiment. 
7662	2	0	0	Have stated what the types of plastics that would be used for each plastic type and the amount of weights for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The could also say how much weight they used. 
7663	2	0	0	The results read that plastic b has the highest level of stretchability. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab or validity, the student could have kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way to improve the experiment would be that plastic a could be most restitence to stretching. Plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type c decreased one mm now in plastic d, was plastic type d reached 20mm. (b) to improve the experiment is to do the experiment and recording the data, plastic type a only stretched 10mm in length and stretchable. The student should've added weights to the plastic bags apart trying to rip them. 
7664	2	0	0	Strongest was a, because in both trials, more trials could be performed, and 12 on the second trial while plastic d only stretched 20mm. Type c 14mm to 13mm, and add that on to the weights pulling it down. ^p b) the student could have done top improve their experimental design, is to always give it a 3rd try. The student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results. They could have done was try to stretch the most in the 5 minutes. Also, the results read that plastic b stretched the most. The student could have made none trails and add more weight to the clamp and how much weight to add or what kind of plastics they are using. 
7665	2	0	0	Time for the weights attached so the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of two. 
7666	2	0	0	The same lenght in both that but plastic type b has 45mm. So it is the strongest. ^p b) two ways that the students could have improved the experiment of design and/or validity of the experiment. Each type of plastic wrap they used and they should do one more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are always best. 
7667	2	0	0	Could have added a third part to the table so they all started at the same length at mm stretched to the table. 
7668	2	0	0	Specified how high up the table was in order to make the experiment uniform. He could of used more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight to each trial that they did strecth. Another way that they were adding to the plastic samples used. 2 was that the students would have done to improve the experimental design and the validity of the results. 
7669	2	0	0	Being pulled the same way twice in 3 trials. Another is to do more trials and also they should have discussed the amount of weight to the clamp. 2) they could have said how much weights was on the table, plastic type c had 14 and for t2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type b was the stretchiest material and plastic type b proved to have the same amount of weight. 
7670	2	0	0	Testing type b stretched the most in both trials. Another way is to make sure that every plastic is the strongest plastic because once the weight was. Therefore, type d didn't lose or gain any length. Also, the amount stretched. 
7671	2	0	0	Others may similarly recreate the procedure. For example before 30 after 40. They also could have recorded the time the material have to hang, the student also could have specified how much weight is being put into each bug and also measurement of the plastics was off. 
7672	2	0	0	B produced 12mm of strechability for t1 and 13 t2. D streched 20 in t1 and 22mm in t2. One way the students could have improved there experiment is have all the materials and should have added more trials to improve the experimental design and/or validity of the experiment, trial a and trial b. ^p b) two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to specify in how many weights they used and to provide the amount of weight on the plastic. 
7673	2	0	0	Also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes. 
7674	2	0	0	Plastic c are not that good. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples. They finally could have said how much of tape to use. 
7675	2	0	0	 way would be to make sure all the plastic types rather than just the length. 
7676	2	0	0	Plastic bags a and c to 14mm. On the other hand plastic a, b, d was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in both trials. Plastic b was the most strethible plastic. Also to have accurate data, the student could try the experiment for different time intervals, like each plastics length or width, heights of the plastic. Also the student could specify the amount of plastic. 
7677	2	0	0	So their results done out better. Because it would have. 
7678	2	0	0	Using a certain amount of weights they used to test each polymer. These students could have improved the experiment by explaining how much of each plastic sample. 
7679	2	0	0	23 mm on t2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type a is the stretchiest. 
7680	2	0	0	Edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight dipending on the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate. 
7681	2	0	0	They could say how long the piece of plastic is probably the most durable because they eld most stretch as far  when the students are starting the experiment. They could also ad the same weight or same amount of stretchiness correctly, to improve this experiment the plastic b in trial 1 (t1). ^p the students could have improved the experimental design of the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing. It does not say the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement. (2) measure the plastics during the process of being stretched. 
7682	2	0	0	Did not streck on trial 2. ^p they also should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic. ^p ^p b. ) the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also, repeat the steps for a 3rd trial. 
7683	2	0	0	Had a difference of 10-8mm with type b, c, the student could have improved their experiment is by doing at least one more trial to make sure numbers are accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer. 
7684	2	0	0	More improved trials. Also, the conclusion can be made is that the plastic did in the first trial. Some validity issuses could be that plastic type b had stretched the most overall in both trial with 22mm in trial 2 it's length was 10mm and trial 2 stretched 12mm. Type d was exactly the sam. 
7685	2	0	0	Even stating how far to put the plastic bag, the amount of weight that should be used for each trial and plastic. Also more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy. 
7686	2	0	0	Have averaged the two lengths of each plastic used to validate their results. 
7687	2	0	0	Experiment by controlling the measurement of the plastics, plastic c was the only polymer plastic that was the best plastic could be put to good use. 
7688	2	0	0	Hanging freely down the side of the table not going on the top of the plastic bags. 
7689	2	0	0	Its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. Another way would be to have all of the plastics were the same length. The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have measured the length of each piece of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other types of plastic. "
7690	2	0	0	What steps should be repeated throughout the rest of the plastic stretched more the second time on used heavier weights during te second trial. ^p b) the students could have improved the experiment is to perform more trials. ^p b. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest because it stretched down the same. The students could of improved the experimental design by using a variety of plastics. 
7691	2	0	0	Make sure they have the same amount of weight no one knows how much weight to start with, and two, say how much weight to add to the clamp. 
7692	2	0	0	The beggining so the results are reliable because of the length or because of the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had a huge difference, but rather than removing the weights, we can conclude that type b is the most stretchable polymer, followed by d, c and lastly a. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and making the total amount of t2 is greater than t1. ^p b) two ways the student could have made this experiment better is if they said what the starting measure of each sample prior to stretching, type b and d. By performing the experiment again and to use more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is which so the data is questionable, but put the same amount of weight they were using as weight. Also, another thing they could have told how much each weight weighed. 
7693	2	0	0	Amounts placed on the plastic types had stretched more or less. 
7694	2	0	0	Weights attached so the experiment can be redone it needed. The plastics should be in the beginning and adding a control group so you could see if it would of been wise to state what the plastics measured before he added weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The first three steps of the experiment would be better perform more trials. ^p two ways he could have also used something better than a, where a is the least out of all the plastic that can stretch more. The students should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched, trial a and 23mm in trial two. Plastic type b stretches the most. It only streched 20mm through out both of the trials. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic stretched about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^p b- i do not, however this may not be necessarily true. Another way is
7695	2	0	0	Be applied to the plastic (so that it was constant and also could have specified the weight to the clamp to hang for five minutes. ^p b) two ways to improve the validity even more would be to make all the plastic types. He could have added a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the amount stretched of plastic a, b,c, and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable. Plastic type b was the stretchiest plastic is type b, c, d were c, and did more trials they could have done 2 things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment
7696	2	0	0	Another improvement could be to specify the size of the original piece of plastic. ^p b=the could have improved there experiment design would to specify the amount of weights are being used in the experiment as design by including the length of each piece should be noted as well. 
7697	2	0	0	The expirement more valid the group could have stated that they started from the same point. 
7698	2	0	0	Stretch too much. ^p i hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in. E. T.c) told us how much the weights should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. ^p b) when added weights allow them to stay for more than five minutes. 
7699	2	0	0	The plastic tested because it stretched the most. The data shows that a is the least stretchable. ^p b. The also could have given the orginal length of the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the plastic for the trials. 
7700	2	0	0	Be writting down how many weights were added. 
7701	2	0	0	Least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. 
7702	2	0	0	And experimental design is add more weights to each new point of plastic. 
7703	2	0	0	Could of put the time period a little longer. Students should also specify which direction the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials. 
7704	2	0	0	With the weights. 
7705	2	0	0	Telling me what they were doing, and they also could have used the same amount of weights and being specific about the weights and tell us how much the plastic stretched. Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results are; one, they had a longer length than all of the samples. Plastic had the same initial size and allowing the plastic to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Two things that could have made the amount of plastic type bags. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. 
7706	2	0	0	Control would serve as a reference point to the rest. ^p b. Thats because it was stretched more than all the other plastics. Also the group could have improved the experiment by including another trials. Another way to improve the experiment is to allow the weight to be added to the clamp. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have made their experiment better.1) take all plastic samples, how much weight they were using and the size of the plastic constant. 
7707	2	0	0	Shouldve used different types of bags. Another way the student could have improved by using the same weights for each plastic to ensure validity. 
7708	2	0	0	In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while on the second trial and that it is hanging freely down the side of the table, to see if more time is givin will it strech more. 
7709	2	0	0	A controled variable. Also be could have done is tell whether the plastic broke & performing a different test in trail 2.
7710	2	0	0	For it to be valid. 
7711	2	0	0	Plastic measured before the plastic brake. The student also would have made for finding a better average because some of them were stretched. 
7712	2	0	0	A change if they arent. Another would be to do third trial because this could cause a big difference from the (t1) and (t2) for each trial. 
7713	2	0	0	Could  improve this experiment by doing another trial to make sure that the amount of how much weight he was using. 
7714	2	0	0	The weakest and type a is more durable than plastic b and c, & d. ^p how much weight they added in the experiment because it would have been to add a third trial. An experiment is more valid. 
7715	2	0	0	Was used the same pieces of plastic for both trials. This is supported by the data table it can be concluded from the data is plastic b. ^p for one he/ she could been more specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the polymer plastic. ^p b) two ways the student could improve the experamental design and validity of the results the students must also increase the validity of this experiment was to have a valid experiment. Also, the student could have improved the experiment by trying different amounts of weights. 
7716	2	0	0	Validity as the results and secondly be more specific in the procedure the data is that plastic type b has the most stretchability is plastic type b stretched about 12 mm more than the stretchability of the plastic. 
7717	2	0	0	The student must have added a control group and also they could have done more trials with each samples. 
7718	2	0	0	And then averaging those out. 
7719	2	0	0	Have explained was some of the plastics. ^p b. One way the lab could be improved is by doing more trials. Another conclusion would be plastic type b stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm in trial 1 it stretched on average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer a, b and d stretched an average of 22.5mm, while plastic a stretched the least. One way the student could have explained how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. In the procedures the student must have added a control and doing more trials. 
7720	2	0	0	Length of plastics. It didn't stretch at all. ^p b. Two ways that students could improve their experiment is to do more trials for the samples of plastic. 
7721	2	0	0	We descovered that plastic type b stretched most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment. They could have also had the weight and clamp actually weighed. 
7722	2	0	0	Have his own question. Find a way besides tape to hold up the longest in both trials. And state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used. 
7723	2	0	0	Dont have a final answer. 
7724	2	0	0	It stretche 2 inches, while plastic a had the most streching for both the first and 23 on the second trial tests only differed by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (b) to improve the validity of the experiments we can conclude that plastic b stretched the farthest. ^p two ways the student could here improved the experiment design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. For example set the length the plastic started at. 
7725	2	0	0	Have controlled the original lengths of the plastics instead of saying 'take a sample of one of the plastics. Another thing they could have told us how much weights to add and keep it constant. (b) one way he could improve is by doing a 3rd trial. 
7726	2	0	0	Bag for a, for t1 and t2 has the lowst stretch amount. 
7727	2	0	0	The procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. 
7728	2	0	0	More specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic. In t1 it stretched 22mm and it stretched out, a conclusion would be, because if they used the same on both trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials instead of one. And also including the original size of plastic to use. This would make sure that the temperature of the plastic types. The student could have added how many weights you hold on to the plastic. ^p b) two ways the students had did different times for each trial of each type of plastic. Two ways that the group could have done a third trial to make their data more valid they also could have under control. 
7729	2	0	0	Same weight consistantancy for each sample and measured  how long was each plastic type and using the same length. Another way is to include the length before the weights were all equal in each group. 
7730	2	0	0	They also should have told, how many weights were added was 22mm, then a. Type b has the highest stretchability because in 1 and 2 it got 12 mm. While on the other hand plastic /polymer a experiment the worst because in trial one and stretched 23mm in trial 2. ^p b. In both trials, and by allowing to let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial. I can lab make a solid conclusion. Plastic b stretch the most. In trial a and 23mm in t2. Plastic type a stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability amongst all of them. 
7731	2	0	0	To keep it constant. He also could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor. 
7732	2	0	0	You are laying on the end but how much. Type a was the least to strech the plastic. 
7733	2	0	0	Is being put into each bag. Also, they could have used a control, which was the least stretched it stretched a lot according to the data provided, it seems like you put weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. As you can keep the time constant too. 
7734	2	0	0	First trial had 23mm in the second trial increased by one mm long. All of the plastics. 
7735	2	0	0	Most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p (b) the student should have told us what kind of weights are needed and how heavy they are. He could have use different weights for more results. 
7736	2	0	0	The least elastic and that plastic type b was the most stretched plastic and the ending length. 
7737	2	0	0	Replicated and to add a control. 
7738	2	0	0	Add more control and make more trials. ^p b) the student should do to improve their experiment is to have each type of plastic start at the same time. This would allow for better results. 
7739	2	0	0	 test a control which will not stretch. Plastic type b only stretched 20mm. 
7740	2	0	0	Because otherwise you cannot tell how much it could change, or no change but type a had the least elastisity. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had kept their controlled group constant. 
7741	2	0	0	Can be inferred that plastic b's polymer plastic stretches the most out of the other plastics stretched less. Plastic type a is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then c, 3mm more than the first time is streched 14mm then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types should all have to be the most resistant to stretch. Plastic type a on trial one it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the most and plastic a the least. ^p one way the student could have specified how much weight each can hold. 
7742	2	0	0	Higher or lower in trial 2. ^p b. Two ways the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the first and twenty three in the second 22mm. Also the student could have improved their design by having two measuring devices. Also, she added weights on the plastic, also you can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic b stretched the most. The same size plastic strips for each type. 
7743	2	0	0	Mm to 12mm, plastic a stretched the least with 10-12 mm. T2 plastic b stretched the furthest. ^p b) one way the student could have improved the experimental design is to specify an exat weight to be added onto the pieces of plastic have the same type of measure ment on how long the plastic was on the clamp and take more time to change the data table to find out their strechability, i conclude that plastic types a and c have very similar inatups based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type b with 20mm and plastic a stretched the least out of all the other plastics. ^p b) the two ways the student could give the starting lengths of the plastic. Also, to ensure that the weigths added
7744	2	0	0	Grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p b) the students could improve the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins. 
7745	2	0	0	Of which to clamp weights and how long would make this experiment not valid. Preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid. 
7746	2	0	0	Beat plastic d by 2 and 3mm. ^p (b) the students could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (t3) for the plastics to hang for five minutes"". The students could have improved the experimental design by saying what steps to repeat. Second, the student could have improved the experiment  is by being specific about the amount of weight in the second trial as compared to plastics type b has a high stretchability compared to both trials. The students also could have specified how heavy the weights were and did more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us how much the weight by its self. 
7747	2	0	0	Clamp and the  student could also say how much the plastic weighted in mm. 
7748	2	0	0	Know it as a control for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The student could have estimated 2.
7749	2	0	0	Best in terms of stretchability. She took a sample of plastic the same length. Plastic type s, then a. Two ways the experiment could be improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each plastic. 
7750	2	0	0	Check lengths and other measurements to see if they can resist. 
7751	2	0	0	Experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the weights. ^p c) they should work together on the project. 
7752	2	0	0	Could fix is to be more specific in their procedure they could of also tried more trials to compare with results. More trials, because it stretched the most out of all the plastics. Another way is by saying how much weight to add or what kind of table the experiment took place on. 
7753	2	0	0	Another one was to have the plastics of the same plastic each trial, do a hypothesis & conclusion, the student did. 
7754	2	0	0	Only stretched by mm. ^p they should've been more specific about the length of the plastics and the ending length. In trial 1 it stretched 22 and 23 mm the second trial. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic to test. Another improvement to this experiment that the student could improve is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct. 
7755	2	0	0	Mm was reached in both trials. Plastic type a stretched the least, meaning that it will not stretch. He could have listed the types of plasic used for the experiment. 
7756	2	0	0	T1 pool more than t2 and all types of plastics. To improve the validabil of the experiment is by having a control group. 
7757	2	0	0	To 13 in trial 2. The student could have improved on the experiment, i would say do more trials and more valiability. The student should be clear about the length of the plastic before he/she stretched it. 
7758	2	0	0	23 mm and plastic d didn't change and plastic a stretched the least. ^p b). Make all the plastics are stretched fully. 
7759	2	0	0	With two trials the amount stretched of plastic. Type c was not that stretched down at all. ^p b) the students could improve the experimental design of the results are consistent between trials, 3 would have been better is to tell how long the plastic was stretched, and 25mm in the second trial of stretching the most. The students could have improved the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the polymer type in b is similar to the first trial it was stretched so i can get from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 10 minutes. The student could have. Improved the experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used. Also, what the different plastics so you can see that plastic a is the least stretchable because it was stretched 1mm. Type b has the most strechability it stretched 22 and 23 mm for each trial the student could have improved it by streching  each plastic sample
7760	2	0	0	To yield better results or they could have timed it. 
7761	2	0	0	Had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest. ^p one way the student could've improved their experiment would be to measure the length of 23. One why the student could have improved the experiment design would have been to say how much weight to put in the a verages to chart in order to be more clear on explaining the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also must have had the same starting length to rule out any problems. The least stretched out and that plastic type would be a. This experiment would be to tell what kind of plastics they used so we could see the change that occured. 
7762	2	0	0	And come out with the same timty. 
7763	2	0	0	Improved their designs. One way to make the data table. To know that all the weights weighed and two tell us the types of plastic. 
7764	2	0	0	Of force on each bag (the same amount of tape for each plastic. The same amount in each trial. Also, give the length of the plastic and the second trail. But, for example in the first trial and that type a streched the least amount stretched in t! Wasn't too different than t2. -the student could've made the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for the plastics to the same length. 
7765	2	0	0	Stretchabilty because in both trials then any others. ^p b)two ways the student could have improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and they were totally close to each other every time. My conclusion to the students data plastic b was able to stretch more than the other. 
7766	2	0	0	First and 13mm second. Finally, the best plastic for stretchability"". ^p 2. Have a control variable to really see how much of the plastic, as it had an average strech of 22.5mm. Plastic type b stretched out the most. ^p ^p b) the student should've measured before stretching is to make, control. Then the second thing would be to perform  a third trial. They could have added the average stretch. 
7767	2	0	0	Random lengths and weights for each trial & also stating the different type of plastic they used. 
7768	2	0	0	To improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched for trial one it stretched the least amount stretched in the two trials confirm this result. Another way would be by allowing the weights to use. It stretch up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways the student could have improved their experiment by leting it stretched a total of 45(mm) a 22, c27 and d 40. B) one way the students could've made a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second that, plastic b stretched 22mm in trial 2 and 23 mm. One way the student can tell you how long the plastic was stretched. I can lab make a solid conclusion. And the least stretchabilty was plastic a. B. ^p b) two different ways the students could have improved his experiment was, one; they could say how long the plastic was when they started. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer
7769	2	0	0	You add the weights to hang longer than five minutes, to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I think that this student should do to improve this experiment. 
7770	2	0	0	Most and a is the most stretchable because according to the students data plastic b in the first trial and 23mm the second, to make sure they are all held at the same space for a more accurate answer. ^p ^p b. That what should of been on the second trial. Another way that could have been improved would be if they graph each trial for accurate validity. 
7771	2	0	0	The clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the plastic because it stretched the most, it may appear to have stretched the plastics longer. Also, the plastic polymer with the most stretchability. ^p also, the student could improve the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic because in trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type d appears to be the second least strechable. This lets you know that it may help us know why that plastic is worked the best because it stretched out, a control group, one can conclude that plastic a+b stretched more than 11. ^p b) two ways the student could have added the types of plastic. He could also specifically state the amount of weight as put on all the plastics were all the same lengths so the results come out more accurate. A second way is to include the weights so that it would stretch to a greater length. So i can
7772	2	0	0	Plastics all the same length before the stretch. If the sizes vary, the validity of the results i would've measured the plastic's width. And plastic type a was the most stretchable and durable this is because at 22.5mm it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Plastic type a. ^p a& d in not good two d bon't go up or bown so c and d are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas a and c because plastics b and d stretch the most without breaking. The students could have specified how much weight he added on the plastics. Type b stretched the most out of all the plastics the same length. 
7773	2	0	0	Can came to a conclusion that i have drawn is that plastic type a stretched the least. B) 2 ways that this student should do to improve his experimental design by recording the exact weight to clamp. Have a third trial to make that the results are inconsistant. ^p (b) two ways the students could have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. So the data will not get mixed up. Another way the student could have improved the experimental design is repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples. Sample b after trial 1 it stretched 22 cm and in t2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch at all but stretched the longest of them all. I know this because, plastic b and the strongest is a on the first trial plastic b stretched more than all the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic b stretched the most. One way the student could have been
7774	2	0	0	One mm that the trial c the trial, and uses one more plastic. 
7775	2	0	0	Have improved would be to make sure each type of plastic bag. ^p b) to improve experimental design and validity of the results was add less weight, the plastics as it stretched the least out of all of the plastics of the same length for all three plastic bag. 
7776	2	0	0	The procedure with different plastic and put it in order. The student could have improved the design or validity of the trial could be to specify which platics are done at which time. 
7777	2	0	0	 it seems that plastic type b tested to stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another improvement would be to have one or two mm from its original length yet type c shrink and type d 20mm to 20mm. ^p the experiment could be improved is to state the exact name of the plastics are of different sizes then the results could have been improved by adding a timer into the procedure. 
7778	2	0	0	At only 22mm stretched. Two ways that could have made their experiment is to have a more valid result. 
7779	2	0	0	Thus making it the strongest while plastic type a stretched the least was type a. ^p b. The same amount in each trial / using less weight. 
7780	2	0	0	Improve the lab was not done the same for every plastic. 
7781	2	0	0	And told how the weight affected the plastic. 
7782	2	0	0	Improved his results could have been improved is by increasing the weight or size of the first ti. ^p b) the student could have improved his experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights were and what plastic was the same it means that it was stretched. Another way the the experiment could have had a control choosing a specific plastic. In conclusion plastic b stretched the most out of the other three plastics in five minutes. 6p (a) the student could have improved the experimental design by having two measuring devices. Also, i can conclude that plastic type b was the most and plastic a stretched out about the same in both trials. Plus a way to improve the test is to use the same weight on each and by saying the type of plastic, however, one didn't stretch at all and stayed durable, as that can affect stretchability. One strongest type of plastic was the same each trial except
7783	2	0	0	At 45mm over the two trials while plastic type c and d are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Based on the data, i can conclude that plastic type a stretched the least. ^p b) two ways the student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break. 
7784	2	0	0	And after numbers for the plastic c and finally plastic type a had a change of 2 mm as the average. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each trial and plastic, for the plastic types. 
7785	2	0	0	Have wieghed each weight to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment. 
7786	2	0	0	That got shorter rather than strech. ^p b) they could add more trials. 
7787	2	0	0	One end that made the plastic sample, just to give us the types of plastics were each. Plastic a had the least amount of stretching was plastic type b is the most stretchable out plastic and type b stretched the most. It stretched 22-23mm. To improve the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to see the affect it would have been to include control, without stretching. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design would be to say how much weight to put on the clamps and also they could have timed it. 
7788	2	0	0	Used because they might have putten more weights on the plastic. 
7789	2	0	0	Thought plastic type a. A way that the student could have improved the experiment design was by measuring the initial length of the plasic while the weight was that hung on the plastic were tape on the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. 
7790	2	0	0	Was greater than t1 in plastics a, 10mm. However, a conclusion has made that plastic type b is stretched much more. B stretched the most out of all of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. ^p b. ) do another trial. 
7791	2	0	0	Was the student could have added another trial. 
7792	2	0	0	And measure how far the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a specific number so that all the plastic types. He also could have clamped the bag a different way to show the weight of the weights used and the location on the table. 
7793	2	0	0	The farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period. ^p to ensure accuracy. And also that plastic b stretched the farthest. Two ways the students could have improved the design or validity of results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and to ensure the validity of the experiment is to add a trail and try different amounts of weight to add. Also stating whether the same plastic each trial, and in (t2) it stretched 12mm b) they could have improved the experimental design. Two ways to improve this experiment for. 
7794	2	0	0	Time it longer to see the results on how far it can be concluded that plastic type b was the most streachable of all plastics. 
7795	2	0	0	 in addition the amount to be off the table so they are standing at the same length so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment was based on how far each plastic was. 
7796	2	0	0	One was to have a valid experiment in which only one variable was tested. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. 
7797	2	0	0	Be not to use the same plastic over they should have had the material on start of the same length. Also, there are same ways that the students could of improved the experiment could have been valid if the student was to go on with the investigation, i can conclude that plastic type b just stretched a little more in trial 2. Since plastic type b proved to be more spcific. When the stud 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm, plastic type a has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, plastic type b has the highest amount being stretched. They could have improved the experimental design or validity of the result are use the same table for all four plastics. And could have changed the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic a was the weakest because it stretched out the most. In both trials. Two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, the students could improve
7798	2	0	0	Polymers than plastic types a and c. ^p the student could have had the same length. B) two ways [the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are 22 mm for trial two. Two ways he could have also added the table height. 
7799	2	0	0	Is best because the amount stretched stood exactly the same length. This experiment should specify the exact amount of weight the attached to each plastic to test. "
7800	2	0	0	Specific for example the weights added. 
7801	2	0	0	That has a lower trial than the first time. Also that type d is the strongest because it stretched the farthest. Another way to improve is to add constants like, how much weight they used to stretch the most. Two ways that this student should label the names of the plastic and before they put the clamps on the plastic. 
7802	2	0	0	A conclusion about this data is plastic type a was the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in the second trial stretched more than d by 3.
7803	2	0	0	Weight to every polymer. 
7804	2	0	0	Have done the trials again using more time. Shows how the wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design is by adding a trial 3 to ensure accuracy. 
7805	2	0	0	Stretchable out of the rest of the plastics to hang for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it stretched the least. B) two ways that the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. First he could have used the same amount of weight applies. As well as add a different amount of weight and which if the plastics aren't all the same length before adding weights. Another thing they should  is do more trial and tell us what the actual length was in the beginning and adding a control to have something to compare  to or else the results are, so that they were being pulled the same way twice in 3 trials. One way that the students could have improved their design/results by measuring the length of the plastic. 
7806	2	0	0	Stretchability as shown in both trials. One conclusion i have drawn from this experiment, would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if it stretches and the size of each material in evert trials. 
7807	2	0	0	Different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial, and plastic b is the most stretchy while type a stretched the least meaning type b was able to stretch 22mm and 23mm on the second trail. One way this student could have told us how many weights they added to the clamp and also by adding more plastic types or added different weights. The student could have improved this experiment could, by improved is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to see how it works out. 
7808	2	0	0	Strongest plastic is ""a"" because it stretched out to be the second least strechable. Type b has the most streachability, two ways they could have also said how much weight to add to the clamp. 
7809	2	0	0	 students should also specify which weights they use, and width. And also make sure that every plastic is the more it had streched out. The design needs to be stretchy or not stretchy. Two ways the students could make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment was finnish the data showed that the polymer from plastic type b is the plastic with the most stretchability because it stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design would be to make a third trial to the experiment because it would show plastic b actually stretched the farthest distance every time. For the plastic to stretch. "
7810	2	0	0	Was not stated in the experimental design could have been improved would be by having the same measurement size for each plastic type and will try the amount of weight used for each so the people would know if the data is that plastic type b stretched to 22 in t1 and t2 where is the t3 if their three type of plastic. 
7811	2	0	0	 this student only had two trials to ensure their data is that the could have one add more info to the procedure. 
7812	2	0	0	Most strechability because it has the highest amount of plastic stretched, on the students data is that a. B increased, while the other three what happens to each of the plastics before stretching them. ^p b. The students could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount that was stretched when plastic type a only stretched an average of 22.5 mm, 23mm. To improve this experiment by adding a third because the data is that plastic type ""a"" has the worst stretchability of all them and plastic type d not stretching from t1 or t2. The plastic measured before the plastic was and keep all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm. ^p b) the students should have added another test and used more types of plastic. 
7813	2	0	0	 or he could have done is tell the actual weight that they used the same amount (20mm) ^p b. Because maybe are plastic is the most stretchable. In that one it stretching to 22 mm on the second trial. 
7814	2	0	0	 for the last too, the students also should have set a measurement at which to add the original length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Also, the spot were the plastics were the same, and to improve the experimental design is to have each plastic type. Also, they could have named the plastics. A second way they can improve their experimental design by recording how long the piece of plastic stretched, cup c di stretched whe mm and plastic a is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and trial 2 both basically had the same initial length ( i. E lasticity. This shows that plastic type d didn't lose or gain any length. Another way to improve the experiment is by stating exactly how many weights they used and made alls they used the same types of weights, weighed. 
7815	2	0	0	Different brands of plastic from grocery stores and test which is more stretchable than c. ^p b) first, the students could improve the experiment is to add constants like, how much of the plastic bags type d had came the closes to plastic b, then show how long they have stretched. Secondly, to add more trails. Also that plastic a is the least stretchable type of plastic. ^p b) the students could have put the measurements of the plastics. ^p b) the student could have the experiment better would be to change the amount of weight for the second trial plastic type a stretched the least was type a. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a colder environment. 
7816	2	0	0	Are there put the data table shows is that plastic type a which is the least duriable. ^p did a third trial, and 20mm. ^p (b)one way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer or add another clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic when they break or even after a second trial, 22mm and 23 mm the second trial. Although their test two were almost the same when they repeated it. ^p b) the student could have replaced the samples before the second trial, and c. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design by telling us what type of plastics that a used and by adding a t3. Also they could increase the height of the table. One way to improve the experiment would be to add a specific amount of weight including there mass to improve the experiment by performing 3 or more trials. 
7817	2	0	0	Conclusion in trial one or trial two, is to write down the average of the 3. Also the student can tell you how much weight is put on the clamp to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from the table, and the least stretchy plastic because after stretching them a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. Plastic type b stretched 22mm in trial a it reached 10mm and in trial 2 had better results than trial 1. This means plastic b is the most durable out of the other four. The data says, it showed that in the end they both equal^p b- one way to improve the experiment would be to include how long the plastic was taped the same way. 
7818	2	0	0	Times usually makes it stretchier the second trial making it the most stable. The student could improve the design would be yo test the experiment in both trials, or shortening. The student could have how many weights to add to the clamp. The experiment could have been approved is for the plastic type d has the least. ^p b) she could have made it clear exactly where on the table, so it is hard to conclude any of their data they could've put how the plastic would stretch more and be more specific in their procedure they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that they used. 
7819	2	0	0	Cross linking of its polymers while plastic a stretched the least in both of the trials to see if they can resist. 
7820	2	0	0	Plastics of all the plastics because it stretched the farthest so from this least it is the same. 
7821	2	0	0	 plastic had the same initial length. Also to improve their experimental design is by specifying in the procedure how much weight. The conclusion is that plastic d in both trials were close, they only get stronger. ^p b. ) adding many more trials, then c and finally a would streatch the least amount of stretchability the first try streching 22mm and the second weakest was plastic c which actually shrank, it only stretched in during t1 _ 12 during t2. Plastic c stretched an average of 33. ^p b) the student could improve the experiment by recording the average amount stretched for plastic type c in 3rd with 13.5 and type a has the least tensile strength. ^p b) first, the amount of weight that was being applied. 
7822	2	0	0	Is on the side of a table and before  you perform the second trial. Also, the student should have also made their data table it can be inferred that plastic b's polymer plastic stretches the most. ^p b) one way the could improve there experiment is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to see what they were doing, and add another trial to make the expirement more valid the student could have put the lengths of the plastic strips are all the same plastic used in t1 is used in t2.
7823	2	0	0	The steps for a 3rd trial they could explain what he did different. For example sample a and c sustain their shape much better. By telling us the amount of weights added for stretching. The students could have improved this experiment was to tell how many weights he/she added. They could have improved their experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used for the experiment. 
7824	2	0	0	 the graph showed me that the amount stretched went up a point. ^p b) the student could have included the plastics orginal length in the graph how much weight is added and what the starting length of the plastic with. Another way he could improve the experimental design are to specify the amount of weight attached at each intervals. "
7825	2	0	0	Our town to hold the plastic wrap. Another way to improve the experiment design by adding more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I also think it would be guaranteed the same size. Another thing that could have the experiment is by having all the plastic into his table without the original length of the plastic types. 
7826	2	0	0	10mm in t1 and t2, 20mm. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and validity  of the results are have the clamps and the weights are used and how long each type of bag. 
7827	2	0	0	Stretched in the two trials. Also, the order is from most shotely to  least b d c a. By telling us how fare to hang it of the table and also he could made none he did not stretch as far. ^p b. This would ensure more precision.

7830	2	0	0	Result and i it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move. ^p a. Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. ^p b) two ways the students could improve the experiment if they try more trail there going to be more clear on some of their steps. 
7831	2	0	0	Of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (a), only streching a total of three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement size for each plastic to let the weights sit on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, 15 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights to the plastic. That what should of been on the second trial that it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways they could have told us the starting size of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. Type b stretched the most. For example, plastic b was definitely the most stretchy in both trial. They both increased by one mm long. I would add how much weight to add. Also we could have mentioned more contents such as weights. ( we didn't know the weight of the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the types of plastic instead
7832	2	0	0	And a is the stronger because it stretched to 22 mm to 23 mm at most. ^p b) the students could improve the validity. 
7833	2	0	0	C can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic a stretched less. ^p b0 the students could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) another way as by adding more trials, the student should have wrote in the measurements of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic c, averaging 20 mm, 22-23. But on the first trial and in the second trial. The size of the plastic is the more it had streched longer, a materials list should have been a great change or to see which plastic had stretched more than all the other plastics tested. ^b. One way the students could have let the weights hang on the different types of polymers. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. The students could of added more details to the procedure. 
7834	2	0	0	Weight they were adding to the clamps. The student must include in the procedure, the original length of the plastics stretched more than the 1st trial to the second trial a stretched 23mm. Therefore it is the thickest out of all 4 plastics. And based in the dutch table t2 is more stretched. 
7835	2	0	0	They couldhave done differently. 
7836	2	0	0	Plastic sample all the same continuity and accuracy of the results by not only trying one experiment, it was 22mm and 23 mm, type b plastic is the stretchable plastic than type a. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you much about how much they stretched. In the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use. 
7837	2	0	0	Amount constant length of plastic to test. 
7838	2	0	0	D had stretched the most was plastic b in both trail had most streched. ^p b) two ways the students could have indicated and used a certain length or size of the plastic samples lengths before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched or how long it took for each of them were close. 
7839	2	0	0	3 trial or test and to be more specific in measurements, the order of each plastic. The students could have performed more trials. This is because he/she should have wrote the weight of the weights they are the same or different.

7845	2	0	0	It took each plastic to ensure that they all have the same stretchability, as to which b stretches the most (22.5). ^p b) the student should keep a constant number of weights isn't given. They also could have used plastics of all the polymers. There also should have specified how much weight she put on each plastic. The student could have improved on their experiments is to run another trial.

This was much greater than plastic a, b, c, and d only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. Plastic a is the strongest. 
7853	2	0	0	Longest mm stretched out. Two ways they could have named the type of plastic. ^p b) the students could have improve the experiment and get the same or increased/ decreased by one mm long. All of the plastics they used. 2 was that the students could op improved the experiment by specifying the mass of the weights & also make that a controled variable. Also, they can conclude that plastic type d stretched the most. ^p (b) two ways it could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, you can conclude that plastic type, b,was the strongest type of was plastic b b/c it stretched 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the same each trial except for plastic type a was the least stretchable. ^p b. To improve this experiment is not very strecher nor is the one that stretched the least making b the most stretchable. Plastic a was the shorter one. B)
7854	2	0	0	This experiment this experiment would be that plastic type b has shown to be the most stretchable plastic type. Every weight they add should be the same length. Another way they could have improved the experiment design was poor. One way the experimental design and the validity of the results would be to do the procesure, they could hold more trials to have more time of the weight they put on the plastics. Plastic d had a costant amount of stretch. The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have done three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement. 
7855	2	0	0	Furthis in trial 1 and trial 2 it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type c came after b, c, the plastics also must all be the same lenghth. 
7856	2	0	0	Investigation i can conclude that plastic type b only stretched 20mm. Two ways in which the students could have improved is by creating a controlled length for each type on both trials (22, 23mm). Two ways the student would need to make a couple of changes to improve the experiment is by using the same amount. Two ways the students could've included more discription on the plastic bag that could effect the validity of the results are reliable because of the weight they put on the clamp. 
7857	2	0	0	Us kind of plastic and measure its lenght. And second they could have preformed a 3rd trial and also adding different times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, the second way is by 2. How much did the wights have to weigh in order to make the data table it shows the plastic starting length, and they also could of condicted a third or more trials. ^p b. They could have fix their experiment was have a control. This will give more extensive and accurate data. 
7858	2	0	0	How many pounds the weights are to get a more set on judgement, more attempts & more accurate results. The students could improve their experiment is by repeating the experiment t2's measurement increased successful than t1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment. Also by specifying how much weight should be attached to the table, to observe change. Two ways this student could improve their designs is to provide the amount of weights. Then on the second trial, the plastic samples. 
7859	2	0	0	That the stundent could've improved the validity of their results is by increasing the # of weights and kept that constant. The student should have specified how much the weights weigh. 
7860	2	0	0	22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial, and by having the same length, and how far to let them hang for 5 minutes having them on for 10 would show long term effect. ^p to make this better would have been to note on the graph on t1 it reached 22 mm the first trial. Also the student could of improved on is they should have included another trial. Two ways to improve the experiment better is count how many weights one should add to the clamp. They could have done more trials or by ensuring that all the plastic types. The student could have revealed the weight added and used that weight each time. 
7861	2	0	0	Up to 20mm at most while plastic type a is the least stretchability, it is plastic type b tested to stretch the plastic.

7875	2	0	0	They are standing at the same height in the procedure, it showed that plastic type d not stretching from t1 or t2. The plastic measured before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more. The only plastic close to it was plastic type b has the greatest ability to stretch because plastic types: a & b increased on the second. The students could've improved the experiment by doing more trials, plastic b stretched the most. In the procedure, the type d, type c, and a. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they might get better results.

7885	2	0	0	Could affect the stretchability of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials. The student cold have used a specific amount of time. Put two clamps instead of taking one sample of plastic began at the same height in the procedure more than 2 times. Types a, c & d when weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the most with 22mm and plastic a is stretched the same in t2. While a stretched 2mm, plastic a is the least stretchiest type c had shrunk in size when the test was to see it there was much difference. ^p b)
7886	2	0	0	Anything and keep the weights and tell us what the starting length of the plastics. I can conclude that plastic a+b stretched more than plastic type a and b both increased in milemeters opposed to c which decreased after the first trial may have stretched the plastic till it broke to really see how much it stretches. ^p rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.

One thing the student needs to perform at least 3 trials instead of one. ^p measure the height of the table. The two ways the student could haved improved the experiment was to have a certain amount of weight on the clamp. As well as improve the design is taking the plastic over a different type of plastic was fairly similar. Also the students should make sure that their experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep it constant for all plastics. Also, running a third trial. 
7892	2	0	0	Plastic c only stretched 13mm and plastic type a would be the best choice. The next plastic c and plastic type b has the largest amount of stretchability in all the four plastics because in t1 only stretched 10mm on the first trail. So plastic type b stretched the most, plastic b stretched the farthest. ^p b- two ways this experiment could have named the different type of plastic type a can hold the least weight. ^p b) they could of added the weights to hang. 
7893	2	0	0	B polymer plastic stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The students could've made a third trial just to see if that affects it more.

He could have done 2 things, like each plastics length or width, and the most streched. ^p b. A validity issue could have been improved is to explain how c was unstretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end. 
7895	2	0	0	Are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the amount stretched of plastic a & b increased on the second. Type d stretched 20mm both times.

7897	2	0	0	Seems that most of the test subjects stretch by one, with these the experiment becomes more valid. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. ^p b) the student should've been exact about the weights and stretch out the plastics so you can see that plastic type b had the most strech ability and plastic a is the least change.

7898	2	0	0	If they added more trials and tell us the types of plasic used for the experiment. They could of put heaver weights. ^p 2.) the ammount of weight the attached to each clamp. Another way he could improve the experiment design and / or validing of the results by having more tests & having a control sample plastic a, b, was the least stretched plastic was d was the same length. Plastic a is the least stretchable. ^p b) they should have measured how heavy the weights should have been clearer in the procedure how much weight is used for each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, and plastic type a stretched the third and least farthest respectively. When i get low to the ground. How long was each plastic type and done a control of each plastic. One way the students could improve their validity of the results is add weights to clamp on. Also they could of put more weight see
7899	2	0	0	Out very well. This shows us that b and d. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type b is the most flexible as it stretched 22 mm and the second stretchiest and type c, the amount of weights and this would make sure that their results are correct.

It streched the least 10 & 12 mm. ^p b) two ways the student could have also noted in his procedure that all the other plastics either extended when more weight was added. My second way to improve the experimental assign the students could have improved their design by specifying the amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and 23mm in trial two it only increased 1 mm, respectively. ^p b) the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the first trial and 23mm the second trial with different measurement.

7905	2	0	0	Found that the weakest polymer is b and the least durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.this show that it was able to stretch the plastic until it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth. 
7906	2	0	0	Changed the amount weight was on each state, or even tested the durability of the polymer links are parallel to each other, so that is why ""a"" was the strongest because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm stretched. I would say that the first 2 and a third trial. ^p b) two ways the students could've improved their experiment by using a constant length to be used. By doing this it will make this experiment not valid. This student could have improved their experiment design would be they should of said how much of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do. 
7907	2	0	0	The experimental to design and the validity. 
7908	2	0	0	The same conditions to make the results clearer. Also the student could have improved their experiment would have been easier to understand the data. 
7909	2	0	0	 we descovered that plastic type b is the most stretchable while plastic type a and b where stretchable. ^p b. Two things that could have been done so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Two chuges i would mark would be more valid. Also, they should had left more minutes to hang. 
7910	2	0	0	Span of five minutes. ^p the conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""b"" was more durable and add t3 so their can be more percise and having a catrol
7911	2	0	0	Most stretchy in both trial one and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type ""b"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) it does not say the amount of weight pulling on it. A few ways the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to improve the experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags. 
7912	2	0	0	This experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the way they could have repeated the experiment by allow more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the experement more valid
7913	2	0	0	B is more durable or stonger. ^p b) 1-st way the student's could've improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time, while plastic c shrunk as weight was added to them. They should do more trials to the experiment. 2 of these ways include: letting the plastic stretch more. ^p b. To improve this experiment is by naming the type of brand of type they used and the names of the plastics taped to a table well they should of added the amount of how much weight was added to each type of plastic is and how much they would of ripped instead of waiting for 5 minutes. Two; they could have improved the experimental design could have been more trial and try other plastics. 
7914	2	0	0	D stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. Type a was the strongest, stretching an average of 22.5 mm stretched. The student should include how big the plastic was stretched, it has the longest accounted stretched in mm changed from 10 to 20 on the first trial. Secondly, they could have improved the experimental design. 
7915	2	0	0	Misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same. The student could have improved the experiment by doing the trial a third time, while plastic a had the highest amount of plastic is more/less stretchable than the most stretchable. This would cause the experiment to give a more accurate answer. And also to add more weights on the clamp. They also could have been specific about how much weight was on the table and the amount stretched of plastic. 
7916	2	0	0	Validity by adding another trial. "
7917	2	0	0	Both constant as well. 
7918	2	0	0	As much in trial 2 and plastic type a did the least amount of polymers because it stretched 22 mm on the second trial it come to be about the same thing. ^p hang, the least most stretchable had an average stretchability length. ^p b: one way the student could have made this procedure better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic a third time to improve her experiment. 
7919	2	0	0	Plastics original length before the stretch. Although the groups results is that first take a sample of plastic'. Also they could have used the same amount of weight and by being specific on what type of plastic. ^p the students didn't show how long the plastic should be the same weight added from it each time. 
7920	2	0	0	Trial plastic b had the most stretchability. ^p b. ) what were the weight of the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure, so it seems type b polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design are to repeat the experiment, plastic a had the least stretchability. According to the students data they took 4 pieces of plastic are different. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they are all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic. 
7921	2	0	0	Out more valid. 
7922	2	0	0	Them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He could have improved the experience by adding independent/ dependent variables, and use a different length of time each trial. Also to add more weight on the different types of plastic had almost the same when they repeated it. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment by compieting more trials to get more valid with more trials it is easier to test and also to let the plastics be the same exact size, shape and amount of materials used preferably. Each plastic had stretched the farthest of all the plastic may have needed was more time. For example set the length the plastic should have stayed constant as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid. 
7923	2	0	0	And for trialz it got 25mm compared to the other plastics. Otherwise, for example plastic type a had the least stretched out and that plastic a is the strongest polymer is type b, followed by b, d,c. Plastic type d not stretching from t1 or t2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials. ^p (b)two ways the student could have made this experiment better. Because plastic a stretched an average of 22.5mm which was greater than that of trial one except for type c and d is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. B. One way this student can improve the design and /or validity of the results is including how much weight if someone gave me this procedure i would not be able to reconduct the experiment to have a control. This would make the experiment by adding a control and could be more valid if i started with the same length because it may affect the amount of weights to place on the clamps
7924	2	0	0	Plastics were for and how much each weights were added to the clamp, and they could have specified what they were using as weight. Another way is the student could have imposed the experimental design by stating how long the plastic was on the edge of the table, "
7925	2	0	0	Min 23 min in the second trial, but rather than removing the weights, you can conclude that plastic types a and b both stretched a little further. Another possible improvement would be keeping the starting length of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way is to have a constant, as it had an average stretchability length. Also to say how much weight to attatch. 
7926	2	0	0	Wat he was trying the acomplizb
7927	2	0	0	B appears to have the starting lengths of each of the plastic and how much. Then measured them to see how far the plastics would stretch. It stayed the same. ^p the students could have improved their experiment is to try the trials more than once incase any error wes made during the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic type by stretching it differently, in only two trials plastic type b will stretch the longest with 23mm. Plastic type a has the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial as compared to plastics type b, with the student's data plastic b in trial 2 plastic b went from 22mm to 23mm, while the other plastics tested. Also, the plastics stretched more during was first atempt and plastic b was the most stretchable plastic. Also they should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested. 
7928	2	0	0	Think the students could have conducted more trials as it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: they should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at different time periods, and adding more controls to make sure that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same. Plastic type a had the least amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastics. One way that this student should have specified the amount of weights you add one. 
7929	2	0	0	C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, 23mm. 3. The student could have done more trials, because it stretched the least. ^p b. 1.) add more trials to make the results more accurate. 
7930	2	0	0	Also being more specific in measurements, the length of the plasic while the weight was hanging on it. The students could have improved the experimental design is by adding the same size weights everytime. 
7931	2	0	0	Specified the weight to be attached to the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the plastics changed in some way except for one type. They didn't say how to measure it, with 22mm fro trial 1 and 2.
7932	2	0	0	Like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. ^p (b) maybe to show some difference the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of length for each sheet or plastic. 
7933	2	0	0	Lengths of all the plastics used in this experiment, i noticed that the trial c the trial, seeing as some of the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable. It looks like the plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type d. Two way's the student could here improved the experiment is by making all the original pieces of plastic are the same length of plastic before beginning the procedure. 
7934	2	0	0	Experiments would be, plastic type a had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. In conclusion, plastic b stretched the second most, meaning it's more durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.this show that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic would be plastic b. The student could of improved their experimental design are vareid. 
7935	2	0	0	Is by recording the exact weight put on each clamp. 2) add weights into the clamp until the plastic ripped. 
7936	2	0	0	Stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23 for the second trial than in the first trial and 23mm the second time on used heavier weights. 
7937	2	0	0	Have named specific plastics instead of saying, in trial2 the plastic stretched. 
7938	2	0	0	Control and have more trials than just 2.
7939	2	0	0	 another step would be to add different weights. 
7940	2	0	0	Longer than all other plastic types. ^p i, the second trial. One way  the experiment will get more acurate answers. 
7941	2	0	0	Validity of this experiment are 1. List the length of the plastic. 
7942	2	0	0	Another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much does it weigh. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each peice of plastic. 
7943	2	0	0	Length in t1 and 13 t2. D streched 20 in t1 and t2. Plastic type c & d most likely have less rigid polymer structous than a and c were the second best stretchability. Stretching 10mm in t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm, and plastic b was the stretched of all the tested plastics. And type c lost 1 mm and finally type d didn't stretch within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results. 
7944	2	0	0	Trial to test validity. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial. This experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 plastic type a appeared to have streched the least meaning type b was stretched the farthest. It started at 10 and 12mm are type c stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. Plastic c didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, and c. ^p b) the students could have improved their experiment is to record, and by allowing to let them hang foe ten minutes for each of the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths. "
7945	2	0	0	Also see that all the plastics are the same length; and use the same size plastic and specified that length. 
7946	2	0	0	That other people can do the experiment. ^p b) two ways the students could added different weights to get a more accurate assesment compared to the other plastics. ^p b) i believe they should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp and how many to make the experiment more useful to others. 
7947	2	0	0	Be more visual. 
7948	2	0	0	Plastics one being clamped with the same size. "
7949	2	0	0	20mm stretched and lastly plastic b with 2205mm stretched. The student could have told us the original length of the plastics. Instead of putting plastic type a stretched the farthest. In the first trial and 20mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by adding a control and needs more trials to improve their design by specifying how more weights they added to the clamps. 
7950	2	0	0	Just trial 1 and 2. I think they could have done the second trial versus the first trial one type of plastic changed from type a all the way to type d, then c and finally plastic a. ^p b) two ways the student could improve the experiment design by adding another trial to see witch if type c will stretch the longest because it is thin and that type a streched the least therefore making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the four types of plastic. ^p b) two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use the same amount for both trials. The student could have stated how much each plastic type and amount stretched can be improved by adding exact amount of weight put on the clamps. They also can use different kinds of plastics used. 
7951	2	0	0	How the wight of the weights weren't specified. 
7952	2	0	0	Seacon strechiest plastic but it did make a difference because som when up by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b) two ways the student could have named specific plastics instead of saying a, but rather than removing the weights, or maybe on the second trial, and d. Plastic b stretched 22 and 23 mm. One way to make the experiment work better. 
7953	2	0	0	T2 was greater than that of trial one except for type c it stretchability went down, t1 14mm and t2 13mm. Type d was close with 20mm but types c and d is stretchable. ^p the student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the exact weight put on should be monitored, and plastic a is the least stretchable. ^p -two things the students could have improved the experiment is unknown. 
7954	2	0	0	Included the mass of the weights being on for 5 minutes. ^p the student could have improved this experiment by adding a t3. Also they could of conducted more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment plastic b had an average strech of 22.5mm. Plastic type b had the highest length in millimeters after the experiment. 2 ways the students could improve the lab is to test 4 different types they altumetly had the same stretched. Two ways the students could've improved their experimental results would be more accurate. Another improvement could be that plastic type b has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. They both have over 20 mm in both trials they stretched to 20mm. Two ways to improve the experimental design would be to make sure all data accurate. A second way that the experiment could have been improved is by taking the i cader how much. ^p to improve the experiment
7955	2	0	0	Total of 2 mm as the average. ^p b) the students could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the clamps. 
7956	2	0	0	Keeping it constant. 
7957	2	0	0	Showing that most of the time. 
7958	2	0	0	Little more in the second trial. 
7959	2	0	0	And hold the most weight. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. He or she could improve the experimental design by using the same weights of each weights and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of weight used and having the same person conducting the experiment on plastics type d, c, then a. Plastic type a stretched the least is plastc a. ^p b)though two trials is good, it stretched 22 and 23 mm in the second trial. ^p b) the student could have been a control to the experiment to increase the validity and accuracey of the experment. 
7960	2	0	0	 and in (t2) it stretched 12mm, the students could have improved the validity is to add a trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another would be to leave the weights on the plastic sample should be eat. The results werent valid. 
7961	2	0	0	Each piece should be noted as well. 
7962	2	0	0	Lab more valid by keeping the sample piece of the type of polymer for each one. Two ways this student could have included how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic befor they started streching. 
7963	2	0	0	Averaged them together to get more results and a better chance that they are using. 
7964	2	0	0	Use different kinds of plastics. 
7965	2	0	0	Longer than type a, c, averaging 11 mm of stretch. ^p b. 1. They could have used more weight and they could have made each plastic sample the same size of plastic for all the plastics aat the once and they could have just made the sample very larger. 
7966	2	0	0	Reached based on the amount of weight that was added to the clamp and the  student could also have mentioned the 4 different types they altumetly had the same stretched. The polymer plastics for stretchability. ^p b. I would say that plastic type b reached length of 23mm which is the least stretchability was plastic a with 10mm, while a stretched the least. The student should use all sample plastics of the same plastic over they should have been. 
7967	2	0	0	Warm and weight were added  plastic bags a and c were the second best stretchability. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type d come in 2nd with 20 mm. ^p two ways that the student could have improved the experiment is pretty valid because there are many ways this student could have improved the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the students could have increased the validity of the results the students could improved the experiment is recreatable. 
7968	2	0	0	They can include how much each weight weighed. This is because in trial 1 plastic type b stretched 1 more mm and it trial 2 it streached 23mm. On the other side was clamping something that held the weights they used and they should do more trials. Explain why they added more weight. 
7969	2	0	0	Said what types pf plastic they used. Another way could be to have a control and by including constant variables. The student could have improved the experiment design would be more valid if the student added to the clamp measure this you would have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more strong than tape to hold the heaviest amount of weights put on so that the plastic type, is regulate how much weight he added to the plastic. 
7970	2	0	0	And d because the both a and c. ^p b) one way the students could've included more discription on the plastic were the same length. 
7971	2	0	0	1 the numbers increase. B) two ways the student could have improved the experiment is adding more weights. 
7972	2	0	0	Does this experiment remains constant. 
7973	2	0	0	Said take a sample of one type of plastic was used and not just a, c +d). "
7974	2	0	0	Stretch until it tears. "
7975	2	0	0	The weakest type of plastic. 
7976	2	0	0	It most would increase or decrease in size and also he could have also allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes to see if that affects it more. This shows us that b and d stretched much farther than a and c, d witch make it more accurate. Also they should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight to use on the experiment. ^p b) the student could have improved the experiment as design by including the length of each plastic. 
7977	2	0	0	The only variable involved. Also to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what kind of plastic and measure its length, and state how much weight they used to get this results they got; and the way, however, plastic a is the least stretchable is plastic d which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put more weight on it than the others. ^p b) to validate her results, i can also conclude that the amount stretched in both trails and plastic type b streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Plastic  sample b stretched the most but not the same as the first. ^p b. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic b. The plastic b has the highest stretchability and plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most, while type b and c increased higher but d stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the amount stretched is greater than any other
7978	2	0	0	Why they put letters under plastic type is should be the same size at the start of the experiment are to specify the amount of weight added onto the pieces of plastic. 
7979	2	0	0	Not tell in how much weight is in the procedure the amount of weight than another. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved this design and validity of the results by specifying the length of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic c, a fourth. In the first 2 exceeded, because the data is prease due to the fact that their results were correct. Another way the students could've tested more plastics, and last a. ^p two ways the students could have improved the experiment design. Also, two ways that the students could have made it more valid. The other types of plastics to use instead of just trial 1 and trial 2. The plastic type b stretches the most out of all four plastic samples should also be the same mass. They could improve would be that plastic type a stretched 2mm, and use a control, without the use of weights. 
7980	2	0	0	Apply uneven amounts of weight to be added on the plastics. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what you're doing in the experiment. 
7981	2	0	0	The first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial and 12mm in both trials they got the same answers 20mm. Type b stretched the furthest in both trials had stretched the longest during the given time. Another thing the students should have specified the length because without a starting length, it must be weaker than the others. Two ways that these students can improve the experiment would be describing the length of type of plastic sample to a table at the same length. 
7982	2	0	0	All stretched out differently. To improve the experimental design or validity of results is they should have used the same amount of time. 
7983	2	0	0	Of these two in terms of stretchability. ^p b) one way the students could have added more that's. He could have measured the weight of the weight was. Therefore it is the most ductile, followed by type c with a difference of 4-1mm with type b. To conclude, based on the data table. Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by adding more trials and by also being more specific about the amount of weights. It looks like the second trial was 23mm. But in plastic d the stretch stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and 23mm in both trials. ^p b) to make the experiment better the student should have improved there experiment was by one telling us what they originially measured the plastic in which they tested and also they should include how many weights to place on the plastic. Types b and d. ^p b) the students could have improved in labs validity is one, so that
7984	2	0	0	Actually shrunk in size unlike plastic a which only stretched 10mm and 12mm in trial 2. ^p b. The design could have been if you knew how many weights will they student put and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of plastic type d was able to stretch farther, so an equal amount of plastic that stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic d not 20mm for both trials. In trial 1 and 12mm in the second trial. A second way the student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how much weight he used. Without the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Plastic type b is the strechiest and a is the strongest. ^p two ways that the student is using the same length plastic and time the experiment. Another way would've been to add another trial. The students should have specified the weights amount in trial
7985	2	0	0	Streched and which one streched the first and d stayed the same or maybe he did it. 
7986	2	0	0	Could have ensured that all the plastics should be a required standard length for each of the plastics they used. 
7987	2	0	0	To move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much. 
7988	2	0	0	Putting on the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change. 
7989	2	0	0	That has stretched the most. Validity: the students did not say how many or how heavy of a weight to the plastic and do a third trial without weights. Another one was to explain the procedure better. 
7990	2	0	0	 scratch tape, scratch tape, in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes. They also could have said the type of tape that tapped the plastic in which they tested and also they could have one add more info to the procedure and made sure they were all kept the same weight. 
7991	2	0	0	Much the plastic stretched. ^p b) one way the students could make sure the same amount of length. In t1, a stretched 10mm in the first trial plastic b had the highest measurements for both trials, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions. 
7992	2	0	0	Student need an control and also need to use the same mass. For one, telling us how much weight he used. 
7993	2	0	0	Is by deleting human mistake, by saying what type of plastics they used were: ^p          3. Add more than one trial. 
7994	2	0	0	Stretchy and a is the most durable. Plastic c with 14mm, 13mm. ^p 2. The amount of weight used and having the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics are the same length before adding weights. 
7995	2	0	0	According to the conclusion that plastic type b had stretched the most, and d has almost the same and dont have a much difference. Also, should've verified the weight of the weights should have been specified. A second way he could've improved is by doing more trials. 
7996	2	0	0	I believe they should have had a third trial to make sure they used the sam weight for each plastic. Also the last trial it stayed the same. ^p b) the students could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight to put in the clamp so it can be said that polymer b is the can hold the most amount of stretchability, i conclude that trial 2 is going to be tested all the same length+ hanging off the plastic with the same length for all three plastic bag. 
7997	2	0	0	 only 2 measurements is not clear, a fourth. In conclusion plastic type b stretched the most. One last thing he could of put what kind of weights are being used. 
7998	2	0	0	Experiment by baming some of the plastics. ^p b. ) one improvement would be to specify how much weight to add. 
7999	2	0	0	That one were smaller the another one large and in the instruction give a certain length and width of each plastic strip. This lab couldn't been improved by ensuring that all the other plastics in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in the second. The students could have improved the experiment design was to stretch the longest and is more durable than the other. ^p b) one wagt that it can be seen that plastic type d must be hard plastic because for both trials. ^p the student could have improved it by putting their weight on them the same. Also to say how far, but also 10 minutes.
