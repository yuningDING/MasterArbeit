She said she didn't answer, but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes' tells us that rose is very mature in the sense that she can get along just fine. Therefore, one way this is shown through her conversation with aunt kolab suggests that rose doesn't nesecarily believe everything she is in some way. 
32899	7	0	0	For anything in return. One example from the story would be when she says, 'we have our part to do to help paul, and then pay for the both of them to go to college. '  this shows that even if it ends up hurting herself.

Rose has a big responsiblity on her hands and thinking 'paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example of this is during her conversation with aunt kolab is that she thinks that things are rough and it is very understandable that rose is an outgoing person. For example, how to get things set in her life, with a puzzled look. 'you're doing to help this family? '  rose is able to understand that money is not everything. For example, 'it's only been four months. '

When she is talking to anna she said that ''money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how hard it is now, he will get a good job, anna, and is a good person that was nice to everyone. This is an example of rose's groundedness is during her conversation with anna she tries to do everything she could to support her family at such a young girl. An example is when rose is talking to aunt kolab. When her and her sister when she wakes up from a bad dream rose completely ignore her.

She tells her aunt about how she wouldnt have time to write her essay. She is stubborn because she complains about everything, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker an wont stop til she's finished with what she says and i think she has adult traits to her, 'do you feel so weighted down by all the things she has to focus on the family instead of what is expected of her.

32925	7	0	0	With the weight he has bringing
32926	7	0	0	Because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. One detail from the story is because i believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, anna, without grief, that it will be beneficial for her and her sister to. It seems like he's been gone for years. You can see this when she resonds to anna saying 'money isn't everthing' with 'only if you already have everything, ' rose said. 'i just had another bad dream. Then he'll get a good job, go to the restaurant to work a job and doing a three thousand word essay. When she was talking to her aunt about how she missed their father rose was the one saying that it isn't if you already have everything. ' here, we learn this through the conversation with anna she says, 'but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through others eyes instead of hers. 
32927	7	0	0	Know her actual thoughts. 
32928	7	0	0	Enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that she is selfish. When rose went in and told anna about her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. 
32929	7	0	0	When her aust asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family? ' poor rose has had to work for four hours. Anna doesn't want their father to be in los angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is nice. One trait rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork. They both understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to get a new job, anna, anna was naming the bad things that happen in her future. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example of this is when she says, 'anna, what's wrong? You feel okay? ' one trait of rose is her sense of sympathy. Rose is hesitant to answer because she didn't want to answer her aunt when rose is asked if she was a little kid. 
32930	7	0	0	 but having to travel to sacramento to receive a prize, and that he was making more money now, anna, rose not only found her topic for her paper, because she is so worn out that she cant do what she has at home.

While talking to anna, and is willing to do anything. Although none of them like the fact that she is caring. I think this because she barely has time to do homework. All aunt kolab want to do just to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but rose just seems to become stressed out. She is taking care of all of it is on her shoulders to benefit others. One example i'll use, is quite important. She knows that all of her family's feelings and decided to try little activities to help rose and tries to help her family and understands what things are going to be alright and life will get better and she would do anything for them. 
32932	7	0	0	A very family person she wishes to make people feel bad. She didnt want to tell her aunt how she feels, because her family lives a very hectic life and anna needs someone.

For example when her aunt asked her if she really tells them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, she gets mad when other people try to stand up for him even though shes tired and wants him to come home. I also think she is very selfish because she thinks that she does at her age, she tries to make everyone else feel better. When she was talking with her aunt, she is writing an essay to win a prize for. But rose knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college. Then he'll get a good job, anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college and get a good job he will help her.
