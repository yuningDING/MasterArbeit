8000	2	0	0	Certain lengths for all the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also. 
8001	2	0	0	The data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics. 
8002	2	0	0	That tore the plastic. 
8003	2	0	0	 second the student should have done is stated how much weight they put on each clamp. Another way they could've improved their experiment is by having more trials. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial. ^p b. That student could of done more trials. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial. ^p b. ) one way the student could have improved the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice. 
8004	2	0	0	A table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how far it would on. 
8005	2	0	0	All in both trials. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable. 
8006	2	0	0	 i can make a conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. 2 ways to improve the experiment the students could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. Also they could have created a graph to show the results after 5, 10, or 15 minutes to see the fluctuation. 
8007	2	0	0	 also it seems as if plastic type a was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type d would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data collected. To improve this expiriment i would have included 2 more trials to make it more reliable would be to make all the plastics the same length when the experiment initiated. A control will allow the student to compare data & the constant will increase the data's validity. 
8008	2	0	0	To prevent breakage of a bag would be type d. By having more improved trials. They also should have specified which samples they were using. 
8009	2	0	0	Have specified how many weights to add into each clamp. Another way to improve validity would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch with the added weights on it. In the second trial it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type a stretched the least. ^p b) they could have told how much weight to attatch. 
8010	2	0	0	Might get better results. 
8011	2	0	0	Large the weights should be. 
8012	2	0	0	The least while plastic d was the second most stretchable, than d, than c, & d. Plastic type a has streched the least therefore making it the most stretchable. "
8013	2	0	0	That they can make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on top of plastic. 
8014	2	0	0	Is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. 
8015	2	0	0	When added and when to add them to the clamp. This experiment is not accurate because it did not stretch at all. ^p name the plastic being used. Then the students should've done the least one more trial. Another conclusion would be that the plastic type a was the lowest. One way to improve their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot. 
8016	2	0	0	To which b stretches the best. Another way the students could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips. To improve this experiment is clarify what the plastics is tested for and if it needs to be stretchy or not stretchy. Also to compare the results to. This experiment would be to have done only one trial instead of two. 
8017	2	0	0	Both to use their by. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, the students should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastics were the same length before they begin the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. They also could have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table. 
8018	2	0	0	Of t1 to t2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials. 
8019	2	0	0	And allow them hang. 
8020	2	0	0	Conclude from the groups results is that polymer b has the most stretchability, whilepolyme a has the least stretchability and plastic type b type b stretched the most. Plastic a in the t1 they stretched less the the t2 in the plastic b in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial stretched more than d by 3.
8021	2	0	0	Stretched in t1 and t2 nie was a little different, t2 was greater than t1 in plastics a, b and c, but in plastic d they had the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to be secure. 
8022	2	0	0	Also to could at told us how much weight to add to the clamp and how much each weight weighs. Also, for the second trial, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic. One thing they could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The student bottles have stretched more during was first atempt and plastic b was the stretchiest. Two things the students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific and also measured the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples'', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure. "
8023	2	0	0	Adding more trial and measure the amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic /polymer a experiment the worst because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the plastics being the same length before starting the experiment. 
8024	2	0	0	Conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except d. The students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length. 
8025	2	0	0	Test another trial which would make the design better. Because plastic d stretched the same amount in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types did not stretch much. Type d stayed the same. For example, if b was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, in step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate. 
8026	2	0	0	B had the weakest. ^p the students could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of the plastic in the table. Also the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also have started out with the same length. 
8027	2	0	0	Weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. ^p 3) the could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different. 
8028	2	0	0	No indication that after the first trial. One way that the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only "" measuring the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"". Also, they could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min. 
8029	2	0	0	That sample b is the most ductile, followed by type a. ^p b. Two ways in which the experiment could have had more weight on it than the others. 
8030	2	0	0	Stretchability is good except d. The students should have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic to use to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. ^p b) the student should have 'did' a third trial. Another conclusion would be that sample b is the the most elastic plastic and type a is the most stretchy, at 22.5mm average. ^p b) the students could have done another trial for more accurate results. 
8031	2	0	0	That i have drawn from the students data is that the sample that was used wasn't the correct form of solution, and i think that he could have done more trials. Another way it could be improved is that the students could have done was add weight and see which one would stretch the most. ^p the student could have improved their experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. They could have told how much weight to attatch. 
8032	2	0	0	Is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too. 
8033	2	0	0	Data clearly shows that the more you data plastics a and b where stretchable. While c actually decrease in size and d did not stretch at all, and the strongest was a, because it might leave longer stretch much. 
8034	2	0	0	Tell what type of plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second they could have performed another trial for each plastic. 
8035	2	0	0	 so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their data. 
8036	2	0	0	Saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5.
8037	2	0	0	Say do more trials and 2. Use more types of plastics. 
8038	2	0	0	Student should include how big each plastic sample should be eat. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were used. 
8039	2	0	0	Could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, they could have done so, by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Also their results of the amount stretched. ^p two ways the student could of had a control group. 
8040	2	0	0	Plastic and how heavy the weights were and how many did he put. 
8041	2	0	0	Drew a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type b is the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^p they could have made sure that each plastic (before stretching) was the same length and mass. For example, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom. 
8042	2	0	0	Can draw a conclusion that at the end of both trials. The second way would be to cut the same length of each plastic without othey are constant. Also the student  should use the same amount of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the design by adding a t3. Also they could of done a better job by instead of the data table plastic b had the more affect for its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic were and do a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as b and d, are much more stretchable than polymers such as a and c. The students could have improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) do it again. ^p b, two ways the students could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, adding will help other understant
8043	2	0	0	Trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic. 
8044	2	0	0	Is if they were specific on how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic before and after. 
8045	2	0	0	They could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment. 
8046	2	0	0	Think the student have to add weight to the clamp. 
8047	2	0	0	It went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. ^p b. ) adding many more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to each plastics. And to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate. 
8048	2	0	0	It tape the plastics so as to make sure their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results. 
8049	2	0	0	Probly a sample streches easily. ^p b) two ways the students can improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also, for the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, the student should also have the exact amount of weight to each polymer. 
8050	2	0	0	How much of each plastic they should measure. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic. 
8051	2	0	0	The most with t1 being 22mm and t2 being 23. And plastic type a had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second, while plastic type b stretched the most but plastic d was constant. He could of also told how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were constant. 
8052	2	0	0	Used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used. 
8053	2	0	0	Would not affect the stretching of the material. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights were. 
8054	2	0	0	Measuring the same side of bag for a, b,c, and d, they are inbetween and c is close to a. The student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights. 
8055	2	0	0	On this experiment is to specify how much weight should be put on the clamp. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity. 
8056	2	0	0	Listing the starting measures of each plastic and performing three trials instead of 2 trials. 
8057	2	0	0	Be equal to the others. ^p b) the student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. 
8058	2	0	0	Plastic and should have done a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment. 
8059	2	0	0	Cut of the 4 plastic types. B) one way this student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics. 
8060	2	0	0	Added should be included in the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand. 
8061	2	0	0	Plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters. ^p b) two ways that the student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. Two ways the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weights for each plastic. 
8062	2	0	0	A stratched less because it was better than plastic b. ^p b) the student could have put the table what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic a, 11mm, plastic c 14 and 13, and plastic d 20 each time. The student also could have specified how heavy the weights are. 
8063	2	0	0	And say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic type b had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type c, and a stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The student did not specify how much weight should be put on the clamp. 
8064	2	0	0	Independent variable can be clearly stated/seen. 
8065	2	0	0	On the student data plastic type b was the most stretchable. "
8066	2	0	0	Trial and let us know where each of the plastics original length before the trials. ^p b) they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more. ^p b) he could told us how much the weights attached to the clamp. 2) to include what the starting length of the plastic was before it was stretched. 
8067	2	0	0	10mm on the first trial it streched out to 22mm in trial a and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type d with 20mm in both trials, them plastic type c stretched less. Plastic type a only stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type a stretched 2mm more in the second trial plastic type a stretched at an average of 11mm while type b stretched an average of 7.3 units longer in t1 and 8 units in t3.^p (b)in their procedure they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that they used. Also the students should have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic they used in this investigation. It held the same while streching the most. ^p b) they should take out the weights. ^p c) they should work together on the project. 
8068	2	0	0	The least stability plastic was a of only 10 & 12mm. B) two ways would have to be ) add a certain amount of weights to the plastic. 
8069	2	0	0	Was able to withstand such stretching. ^p the students could have included a third trial to see witch if type c will remain to strengh and less. 
8070	2	0	0	If they include what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have done another trial to make the experiment uniform. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate. 
8071	2	0	0	Plastics in the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial to the second trial. They could have made none trails and add more weights on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results. 
8072	2	0	0	And all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p b) this student should've identified the length which all four plastic samples should be. 
8073	2	0	0	Made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them. 
8074	2	0	0	 the weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of the experiment. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control. 
8075	2	0	0	Differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same. 
8076	2	0	0	Have let the plastics hang longer than 5 min. 2. They could of had a third trial. 
8077	2	0	0	Plastic was the same size to begin with. Also the students should have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic tins being used. 
8078	2	0	0	Draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. Also the same length of plastic for each type because this may affect the results. The plastics should be the same to start. Secondly, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. ^p the student could have put the initial length of the plastic in the table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had 23 mm. The students could have improved the design or validity of the results. 
8079	2	0	0	Plastics instead of using letters. 
8080	2	0	0	Could also use more precise instrument or run more trials. 
8081	2	0	0	Trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams. 
8082	2	0	0	Another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much space was the weight and plastic from each other. 
8083	2	0	0	Each type to make sure findings were acurate, and to do 3 trails each. 
8084	2	0	0	Two ways this design could have been better is by saying how much weight was added to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure. 
8085	2	0	0	Millameter greater in the second trial (t2) had increased the amount of time the weights were on the plastic bag, the more they stretched. This would have improved the experiment design would be to have a specific amount of weights in the clamp and having the average of both trials. Type d stayed the same during both trials. Type c and d are in the midle. ^p b) the students could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was being added to the plastic types. 
8086	2	0	0	A different way to show the data. I can conclude that plastic b stretched the most out of both of the trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment. 
8087	2	0	0	Andon the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first. 
8088	2	0	0	 in t1 it  stretched 22 mm, and type d remained the same. ^p a third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were. 
8089	2	0	0	After the second trial while plastic type c and d which did not change. Two ways the student's could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment, the students never told us what the starting length should be. 
8090	2	0	0	2 stretched more then plactic type a, c and d. Two ways that the students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 5 minutes. The table also shows that plastic type b has the highest amount being stretched. In trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The plastic that was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 12 mm in trial 2. Plastic type c & d  obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch. Plastic type b stretched the most because it is thin and that type a streched the least meaning it is the least flexible. The first way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the bag. ^p b) one way this student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and specific measurements. 
8091	2	0	0	And that how i do it? 
8092	2	0	0	Or add another clamp to the plastic sample. 
8093	2	0	0	Type d was at type 20mm for t1 and t2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability followed by type a, c, and lastly type a. Plastic d was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic type c and d which did not change. Two ways that the student could have improved this experiment is  by naming the plastic in which they tested and also they should have mentioned this in the table. 
8094	2	0	0	Sample without any weight added. They could also repeat the experiment. The student could of improved the design by adding a t3. Also they could of used heavier weights. 
8095	2	0	0	Different trials could also give out more beneficial data. 
8096	2	0	0	It was stretched and keep the amount of weight. And also have started out with the same amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant. Plastic type d stretched the furthest and plastic type a was the least stretchy. ^p b) one way this experiment could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed, and also to add more weight to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial. ^p b. The least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial in the second trial. Plastic type b proved to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p b) the student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break. 
8097	2	0	0	Would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes. 
8098	2	0	0	Most durable when stretched, and how many weights to add at a time, so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their data. 
8099	2	0	0	Didnt stretch at all. ^p 1 way) student could have changed or tested the different plastics at different times. For example, if b was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. A) the student could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics. However, a was the least stretched out and that plastic type a is the strongest and plastic type a stretched the least. B) in there data table they could have given how much weight was added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. ^p b). Add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials would have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial. "
8100	2	0	0	Good experiment has at least 3 trials. I also think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp. So youwill know how many weights put in each cup. Also the student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight should be added to the clamp for each plastic. Also, i think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial plastic b had 22 mm and the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p the student could specify the amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out. 
8101	2	0	0	Been to write down the initial length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. State how much the weights weigh. The students also could have used a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters. ^p b) two ways to improve this experiment is to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic. 
8102	2	0	0	One was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results. 
8103	2	0	0	Strogest type of plastic they used. 
8104	2	0	0	They added weight b. A second way is to name why they are doing it, and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing. 
8105	2	0	0	We can say that plastic type c can stretch the most. The students could have done more trials. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are two ways to improve this experiment is one, adding a third trial for increased accuracy, and to specify the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. For example, plastic b stretched the most amount  therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched the most. 
8106	2	0	0	How much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging. 
8107	2	0	0	Validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clam, and the plastic type b of trial 1, from a 10mm and b 22mm. Also the student could have put the table what kind of plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment doesn't show the starting size of each plastic sample. 
8108	2	0	0	Mide of the least amount of millimeters. ^p b) one way the students could have done another trial for more accurate results. 
8109	2	0	0	Plastic b had an average strech of 22.5mm. Plastic c though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic a which went from 10 to 12 and b which went from 22-23 mm and lastly d witch remained at 20 mm for the second trial. 
8110	2	0	0	Bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way this student can improve the design and validity at the results is to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise. 
8111	2	0	0	Another way is how heavy was the clamp. 
8112	2	0	0	All to a certain length. Another thing could they could have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic to put the clamp on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. I did two tries each. Two things that could be improved in two ways: the plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The student also could have made sure each plastic was the same length. 
8113	2	0	0	Keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability. 
8114	2	0	0	Plastic or test it more than two times. 
8115	2	0	0	The procedure how many weight to put on to the clamps. For all i know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so that the results would be inaccurate. 2. They could have performed another trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design by using the same length of each plastic to test. The students could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic. 
8116	2	0	0	Had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic b, probably due to the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have specified a single starting length for each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p 2. The student should have used the same length of the plastics and the width. 
8117	2	0	0	Types b and c fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; b was more stretchable than c. ^p b) 1.they could of easily measured for more time. 
8118	2	0	0	To see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data. 
8119	2	0	0	Plastic is the strongest. (b) one way the student could have estimated 2.
8120	2	0	0	Show consistency  or change in the experiment. 
8121	2	0	0	Was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved this experiment by adding a control to the experiment to improve the experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight he added on the clamp. 
8122	2	0	0	Longest length of the plastic at that time. 
8123	2	0	0	For all plastic types. 
8124	2	0	0	Data plastic b stretched the farthest on both trials. ^p b) one way to make the investigation more valid is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length. Also must have had the same starting length and added the same amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight they added the the clamps. 
8125	2	0	0	20 mm was reached in both trials. The students should make sure that the weight applied to each plastic was the same length and that the same amount of weights for each plastic. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm). 
8126	2	0	0	Begin with and the plastic is unknown. 
8127	2	0	0	Tube c it went down a pont and for d the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^p b) two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics. "
8128	2	0	0	Out differently depending on how much weight was more used and if they were the same length. 
8129	2	0	0	Trials to get a more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were. 
8130	2	0	0	Add on the procedure instead of just saying changed. "
8131	2	0	0	A stretched from 10mm to 12mm. It had 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2. None of the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have also mentioned the name of the polymers to make the data table more specific and efficient. 
8132	2	0	0	So type b had the most stretchability. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate. 
8133	2	0	0	Been a different type of plastic sample to measure. 
8134	2	0	0	The longest in five minutes. Plastic type a can hold the least weight. ^p (b) two ways the student could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, an average of 22.5mm, while type b and c were all longer than t1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights in the clamp and having the average of both trials. Also, describe how long the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. I also noticed that the most stretchable was b and the least is plastc a. ^p b) they could have improved was to show how many weights they used. 
8135	2	0	0	The same for both trials with amount of 20. B) two ways the student could have improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they were adding to the clamp. Also, the student could have used the same amount of weights for different times. 
8136	2	0	0	Of plastics being tested so that you have more results, and by adding the new much the weights were. ^p 2) to have improved the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample. 
8137	2	0	0	Decreased and the amount stretched for plastic d remained the same. ^p b) one way to make it more valid. 
8138	2	0	0	Can do is add one more trial. Another way would be to cut the same length of different plastics each time. 
8139	2	0	0	Most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most durable. I think that this student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type d stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^p b) i believe they should have identify the different plastics. 
8140	2	0	0	To be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic a seemed strongest. ^p b. The students could improve their experiment would be to add more trials, adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly. "
8141	2	0	0	Most in both trial 1 and trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p b) the first way the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control
8142	2	0	0	This lab better is that all the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm. 
8143	2	0	0	Long they have stretched. They did this twice for all four types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. The students could have improved the experiment would be that plastic type a has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p b) to improve there experimental design and validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more. Two ways the student could have recorded the time the plastic brake at. 
8144	2	0	0	Stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial (t1). Two ways the students could have added how much were the weights he used. Also be could have done another trial and drawn a diagram. 
8145	2	0	0	Of also explained how plastic types become smaller. 
8146	2	0	0	Of the plastic with. 
8147	2	0	0	Is should be the type of plastic. 
8148	2	0	0	 so it has a accurate chance of stretching. ^p b) the student should have added a specific amount of weight to be attached to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure. 
8149	2	0	0	Included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics off the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and then do this experiment than twice. 
8150	2	0	0	Elastic plastic and type a is the strongest because it stretched less. ^p the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table. 
8151	2	0	0	Told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how much weight each can hold. 
8152	2	0	0	Actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type d stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b. ) to improve the validity of the results are by telling us how much weight they held part on the clamps. The student could have improved the experimental design would be to state the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic. 
8153	2	0	0	The most mm than t1.^p b) the student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. 
8154	2	0	0	Design by keeping or consistent sample size. Another way the the experiment could he improved is by telling the reader where the clamp was placed. 
8155	2	0	0	To be that when we tested the plastic type by was the one with the most stretchability is plastic type a is the strongest because t1 only stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm. The student should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table. 
8156	2	0	0	A control variable to really see the change in plastics. 
8157	2	0	0	Can be absolutely sure of their results. 
8158	2	0	0	D not stretching from t1 or t2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials. One way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty. 
8159	2	0	0	 and also by being more specific as to how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be. ^p a& d in not good two d bon't go up or bown so c and d is not good for the investigation. 
8160	2	0	0	D  obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastics they used, not just any measure the length (1). 
8161	2	0	0	My conclusion b was the one with the most stretchability is plastic b. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics, also they could of done was add more trials or change the type of cup. 
8162	2	0	0	How long the strip of plastic is and how much weight to actually add. 
8163	2	0	0	To the floor instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length would improve the validity of the results is, first by making the procedures more clear. Second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed. 
8164	2	0	0	To see it stretch. 
8165	2	0	0	And to show on their data table how much weight the stretch could withstand. 
8166	2	0	0	Being specific on what type of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they added on top of the clamps. They also could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial, it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) ways to improve both the design and validity at the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas. 
8167	2	0	0	While b and c were the most alike. For example plastic type a first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p the students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the data, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes. 
8168	2	0	0	One being clamped with the same amount of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that their results are closest. Polymer in a is not very strecher nor is the one in c. ^p (b) two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to try the trials more than once. 
8169	2	0	0	Had an average strech of 22.5mm. ^p two ways this design could have been improved is to have more trials and specific measurements. 
8170	2	0	0	Plastic types didnt that far. In the second trial depends on the type of plastic will determine how much it will stretch. ^p b. ) the student could improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp. 
8171	2	0	0	The results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the same amount of weight. Also that the original plastics are all the same. "
8172	2	0	0	Only increased 1 mm, type c stretched an average 13.5mm and type d stretched the second most with an average of 22.5mm, while the other plastics didn't stretch as much as plastics b, c or d. Plastic a is the least stretchable and plastic b is the stretchiest plastic. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types. Not only that but what the student could have also included to use the same amount of weight in each one. 
8173	2	0	0	You can see in my table that plastic b was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic. 
8174	2	0	0	The student could add another trial for each of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial. Plastic type b is the stretchable plastic than type a, c, and type d 20mm to 20mm. ^p b. The student could have improved this is to add more trials. Another way being how students could have improved their experiment would be to add in the original lengths of the plastic in their results. 
8175	2	0	0	Starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the least stretchiest plastic out of the four tested. This is because the millimeters stretched on b trial 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes. The plastic that least stretched was plastic a. ^p b) they could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion from the students data, plastic b went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic c stretch 1mm and plastic d was the second strongest, followed by type c then type a being the least stretchiest^p b)the student could have improve this experiment is to perform more trials. 
8176	2	0	0	Have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type lastly the student should have specified the weight being used. 
8177	2	0	0	They put weights on the 4 different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic c can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic d can only strech 20 mm. Plastic d had similar results for both trials. Two ways the students could have added the premier measurement to the chart, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions. 
8178	2	0	0	Is they could have made sure each plastic was the same. 
8179	2	0	0	More specific in the procedure about the plastic types. 
8180	2	0	0	Data table the conclusion of this experiment, plastic type b is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p in conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and what it is measured in. 
8181	2	0	0	It held the most weight. One way the students could improve by being more detailed in those procedure. Another way would be writting down how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 23mm the second trial. One way the student could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more valid results. 
8182	2	0	0	Design an validity of the results are that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table. 
8183	2	0	0	Weight needed to be used. To improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic they used. 
8184	2	0	0	Is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight added and a third trial. Also, another way that this experiment could be improved is to state the amount of weight added to the clamp in step 4.
8185	2	0	0	 so each plastic is being tested the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results show that plastic b was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. I can conclude that the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer a stretched the least over the five minutes. They students could have improved the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic. 
8186	2	0	0	Of the plastics remained mostly the same from t2 to t2. ^p b. ) one improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be then potting more weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic b streched the most at 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of all the other plastics tested. ^p (b) they could have did more trials because the more they do, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, plastic a stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and that the same amount of weights for each plastic. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic instead of type a, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This
8187	2	0	0	And 2 stretched the most and a the least. ^p b. ) one way the validity of the experiment is unknown. 
8188	2	0	0	They could of done was add more trials or change the type of cup. 
8189	2	0	0	D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p b) to improve the experiment would be to make sure that the weight applied to each plastic was the same. 
8190	2	0	0	Size with specific numbers. 
8191	2	0	0	Stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.plastic d was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 23 mm the first and second trials. 
8192	2	0	0	Trial for plastics a, b, c, and d has almost the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same since you're not measuring that and plastics should of been made of the same type of material. 
8193	2	0	0	The weights in the same places. Another step would be to make a third trial, seeing as some of the results were changed. Another way would've been to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be taped to the table, how much weight am i supposed to add. Also to say how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the plastic types. 
8194	2	0	0	Time to the bags being stretched and they could have preformed more trials. 
8195	2	0	0	Stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific amount of weight should be used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials. 
8196	2	0	0	Is to start out with the same amount of weight to add to the clamp. 
8197	2	0	0	Were used in this experiment. "
8198	2	0	0	Have repeated the process to find out why t1 data is different from t2 data. 
8199	2	0	0	Done three trials instead of two to see the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the numbers stayed constant. 
8200	2	0	0	Stating how heavy the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure. 
8201	2	0	0	The most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p (b) the student could included time and more trials. 
8202	2	0	0	Because there could be human errors, and more trials would lead to more accurate data. 
8203	2	0	0	Was the best with the longest (mm) stretched in both trials. One way the data would have been to write down the average of the t1 and t2. A conclusion based on the student's data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic a and c stretched about the same amount of weights applied. 
8204	2	0	0	And 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial than the first. The second trial the first. ^p two ways the students could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to put on it. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice. 
8205	2	0	0	That everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The next thing that needs to be specified. Also, to specify the amount of weight added onto the plastic bag and one longer the weights were on the plastic bag, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, plastic a is the least stretchable. This is because it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 13 on the second. While the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If i need a plastic with the largest stretchability, i would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment. 
8206	2	0	0	And place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on this student's data, plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type b is the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm whereas a averaged it, c averaged 13.5 and d averaged 20. The students should have included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamp. 
8207	2	0	0	To hold my things. ^p b) the student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for both trials. ^p b) to improve experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, you can conclude that plastic b stretches the most. ^p the student could have improved his/her experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic wrap. And at last have more trials. 
8208	2	0	0	That were labeled a, b, c are the most resistant. ^p the student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
8209	2	0	0	Weight to see how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us what types of plastic was used for the experiment. 
8210	2	0	0	His data is inconclusive. The student could improve is by making sure the plastics were all the same length, the started them. 
8211	2	0	0	A streached out the most out of the samples. Plastic a was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic c. ^p b) 1-st way the student's could have done to improve their experiment. 
8212	2	0	0	Is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type b streached the most, the type of plastic is on the side of the table. 
8213	2	0	0	Each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. Why he could of improved is how much weight is being put on each time. 
8214	2	0	0	1 plastic b stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. The polymer d was 3rd c was 2nd and a was the least"", to improve the experimental design is to run another trial. 
8215	2	0	0	For plastic type b was stretched the most. ^p b) two ways the students could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment. 
8216	2	0	0	Being stretched out the first time. The most stretchable plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type a produced the most amount of resistance to be streched, plastic bag type a had the most amount of stretching was plastic type b. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve their design. 
8217	2	0	0	Was stretched the farthest where plastic a was stretched the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges i would mark would be more trials and more valiability. The student could have improved the experiment design would be to state how much weight to actually add. 
8218	2	0	0	Wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length plastic and time the experiment. 
8219	2	0	0	Of given us the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us how much the weights weighed and how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also tell us a specific weight. 
8220	2	0	0	 the amount the plastic stretched. 
8221	2	0	0	Amount on the second. A way the student could have improved their experiment design/validity is specify if the same amount of weight put on each plastic. In trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the strongest. B the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different. 
8222	2	0	0	Have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to each trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. It stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) one way the student have improved on their experiment is by adding materials and also doing the experiment again. 
8223	2	0	0	Is being used and specify on what types of plastic was stretch more than others. The students could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic were originally. 
8224	2	0	0	Experiment by stating the weight of the weights should have been. 
8225	2	0	0	The plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (b) to improve the expirement, the students could have improved the expirimental design was to have a third trial so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing is they have said how much weight to put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole. 
8226	2	0	0	Procedure list their data table. B two way i think the students could of improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is to be added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used. 
8227	2	0	0	A specific amount for the weight to work. 
8228	2	0	0	B just stretched a little further. This means it has less elasticity than the other types. Two ways the student could have improved is by putting one set of weights in t1 and another st of weights in t2. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials. 
8229	2	0	0	Did trials with a different amount of weight than another. ^p another way to improve validity would be to specify how long each plastic had to be. In the end the students could have improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample. 
8230	2	0	0	Is plastic type d had the same amount of time. 
8231	2	0	0	That plastic typ d stretched the most and which would be stronger. 
8232	2	0	0	Intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment is by 1. Telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched. Two ways the students could have improved their lab is by saying how much weight to add. As well the student could have specified a single starting length for each plastic, perfeably the same length for each. 
8233	2	0	0	Experiment is by specifying what the weight of the clamp was subtracted. 
8234	2	0	0	By adding more clamp or by streching it more. 
8235	2	0	0	 multiple tests would have shown more constant results. Lastly, in the second trial depends on the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the weights. 
8236	2	0	0	Trail had most streched. ^p b. The student could change the experiment is by having a third trial to see witch if type c will remain to strengh and less. 
8237	2	0	0	That when stretched a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p b. Add different weights. 
8238	2	0	0	Chat the the student did. 
8239	2	0	0	Need to improve their experimental design they could have written how much weight the stretch could withstand. 
8240	2	0	0	Before and after stretching. 
8241	2	0	0	Stretch within both trials. Therefore, making their experiment invalid. 
8242	2	0	0	Low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and c however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. 
8243	2	0	0	Could also be more specific about the different polmers used, they could have told us how much the weight and clamp actually weighed. 
8244	2	0	0	Plastic according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic. 
8245	2	0	0	That in trials the student conducted it seems that in t2, the plastic stretched more than trial (t1) for plastic type a was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p two ways the student could have improved his experiment is by doing a 3rd trial also the student could of also tried more trials to see if the plastic would stretch. 
8246	2	0	0	Out of plastic a, c, and d all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial it stretched 23 mm. ^p b. Could have done more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident. 
8247	2	0	0	Expiriment i would have included 2 more trials to make it more reliable would be to make the experiment a little more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate. Another thing they could have done a third trial. In the second trial. Two ways the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is to make sure the, same amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that one type of plastic b measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length. They can also say how much weight is on the clamp. 
8248	2	0	0	Types of plasic used for the experiment. They could have added more trials and added more weight to each plastic would improve the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also the plastics should all start at. In order to make the experiment work better. 
8249	2	0	0	A specific number so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control, for example a non plastic to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment. 
8250	2	0	0	Same length for both trials. B-they could repeat trials, and specifying how much weight was pulling on the plastic. Would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also have a control
8251	2	0	0	Also different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
8252	2	0	0	By doing more track. Another way that they could have improved the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp. They could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable. 
8253	2	0	0	Dropping the weights on the clamp. Right now there is no constant in the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students could improve the experimental design. 
8254	2	0	0	Allow them to hens for longer. 
8255	2	0	0	Longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest. ^p b) perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length. 
8256	2	0	0	Be a good grade or data count. 
8257	2	0	0	From most to least stretchy, is b, d, c, and d. ^p b) for the student to improve the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase. 
8258	2	0	0	Polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they were using to stretch the material. 
8259	2	0	0	Most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
8260	2	0	0	Measuring different lengths to start with. 
8261	2	0	0	An average of 2200mm, while plastic type b is the most stretchable, followed by plastic d with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic b with 2205mm stretched. The student could improve the lab is instead of two trials do three. Find waay is have a control grone. 
8262	2	0	0	Plastic because it stayed the same length. B) two ways the students could have improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before starting the experiment. This is ture because plastic a stretched the least with 10mm estretch. ^p b two ways the students could improve the experimental design the students could have improved the experiment would be to specify a specific number and type of weights that are being added and to keep it constant. The results werent valid. 
8263	2	0	0	Not mention other plastics. Plastic b streched 22 on t1 and 23 mm on the second trial, but ""d"" stayed the same. ^p (b)two ways the student could improve the experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the 4 plastics need to be kept constant. For example i the type a plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. 
8264	2	0	0	The clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial versus the first trial also plastic type d was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight should be added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used. 
8265	2	0	0	To change the plastic to which is more durable and add t3 so their can be more results. 
8266	2	0	0	Trials in the first it stretched 22 while a,10, c 14, d 20 the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the clip. 
8267	2	0	0	Weights until the plastic, rerare adding the weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right. 
8268	2	0	0	Of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths. 
8269	2	0	0	Amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight). "
8270	2	0	0	Second and first trial. Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Also, since there are 2 trials, the lengths should be averaged. There also should have been a third trial so the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length of the plastic. For example plastic type a for trial was 10mm and trial 2 plastic type a stretched the least. The student must determine the weight of the weights was not given as it does affect the result in the amount stretched. 
8271	2	0	0	It sit for longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are all coming from same temperature. 
8272	2	0	0	Is that on the plastic types c for t1 pool more than t2 and for plastic tyre d t1 and t2 had the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same length. Another way is to say exactly how much weight was on each state, caused the plastic to stretch. B. ) two ways the students could have done a second trial with heavier weights. 
8273	2	0	0	We can now conclude that plastic b was the stretchiest. One way the student could have done more trials with the different types of plastics. The student could've improved this experiment would have different amounts. Also, in the second trial then the first trial. On the other hand, was the stretchiest. After that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn't. 
8274	2	0	0	Of used the same amount of plastics. 
8275	2	0	0	Against the other three. ^p state what length you're excepting to keep them the same. 
8276	2	0	0	Up best against the wheight of the wheights. So i would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type a was the least stretchable. ^p the student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, another way the student could have done more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p also, they need to include how much weight to the clamp to see what changes. 
8277	2	0	0	Experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials. 
8278	2	0	0	The amount of plastic use for all 4 plastic used. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is important to keep your constants, constant. 
8279	2	0	0	Same weight for all of them. 
8280	2	0	0	Stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 23m  the second trial all of the plastic types. 
8281	2	0	0	D has the most stretchability in the trial, and plastic a seemed to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p b). Two ways that students could improve the experimental design the student should have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table. 
8282	2	0	0	Measure a specific amount all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic c, plastic c decreased 1mm in trial 2 and plastic type c stretched more than plastic type a, from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type b shrinkid from
8283	2	0	0	Plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type a doesn't stretch as far. ^p two ways that the student could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights on the plastic were also kept consistent. 
8284	2	0	0	Student could try the experiment for a longer period of time like 10 minutes. 
8285	2	0	0	Weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals. 
8286	2	0	0	The data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity by doing more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength. 
8287	2	0	0	Stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p one way the student could have improved the design is by stating how much weight they are adding on at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is very clear that plastic type a streched the least. B) one way they could have improved there experimental design is to do another trial. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add or what kind of weights are being used. 
8288	2	0	0	Students could improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. The student could've listed the diffrent types  of plastics used and explain the procedure better. 
8289	2	0	0	They used and which one was the control. 
8290	2	0	0	And see what it was after. For example the weights added to the clamp for each plastic. Also the student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp weighed. 
8291	2	0	0	Two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm. ^p b) first, the students should of told us what type of plastic it is. Plastic a stretched the least after both trials. Plastics a, b, c, o hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results. 
8292	2	0	0	They should have made sure all the plastic types were equally cut and measure. They could of did more trials to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how it would stretch. 
8293	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the plastic was taped at the same spot. 
8294	2	0	0	The cup before the cup and then they could have just added until the plastic ripped. 
8295	2	0	0	Know where each of the plastics and by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. B) one way this student could have improved this experiment would be to increase the amount of time that each plastic type hong. 
8296	2	0	0	It only increased 1 mm, type c stretched an average 13.5 mm, then plastic type c, followed by plastic d, c, and d were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. Also, they could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
8297	2	0	0	Design by conducting another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the length of all the plastics. To improve the experimental design or validity of the results is did a third trial, and 23mm in the second). B) these are ways the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial. Another way is to say exactly how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, the student could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would cause the experiment to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he also could of given us the names of the plastic. 
8298	2	0	0	Table the conclusion of this experiment is that plastic type b was the most stretched out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. 
8299	2	0	0	More stretchy than others. ^p b) one way to improve the experiment the lab needs to know the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastics, type b polymer plastic stretched the furthest was type b next was type d, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic. 
8300	2	0	0	With 22m in the first trial (t1), it can't be exactly the same. D stayed the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) two ways the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right. 
8301	2	0	0	Befor he did the experiment, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length of 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic a with 10mm in t1 and 12 in t2. ^p b. ) the student could improve this experiment by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the clamp, and make sure they were all the same length and other decreased. ^p the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results is to make sure all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic c, the a. ^p (b)this student could made this lab better in two ways, the student should use the same weight to stretch. ^p b) the first way the students could have improved their
8302	2	0	0	Student can do is add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results. 
8303	2	0	0	Because it streached an average of 11mm while type b stretched an average of 12mm. ^p the experiment could have been improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic b is the strechiest. It's the most durable and can hold the most. The way the student could have done 2 things, give the height of the table, plastic b etc. Also to average the data out. 
8304	2	0	0	Could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag. 
8305	2	0	0	Experiment a little more valid. Also the student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. 
8306	2	0	0	3trials to make sure numbers are accurate. 
8307	2	0	0	By determining how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials. 
8308	2	0	0	The weight or size of the plastic samples, and to add four more trials. 
8309	2	0	0	For all plastic types. 
8310	2	0	0	The same table for all four plastics. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment by saying how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic. 
8311	2	0	0	Which type of lope to use. 
8312	2	0	0	An average of 21mm while plastics a and c stretched about the same amount of the first trial. On the second trial. The two ways the students could improved the experimental design or validity of the results by 1) saying in t1+t2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. The students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastic samples. 
8313	2	0	0	Stretched each sample as far as it would go. 
8314	2	0	0	Done another tril to make sure if he got different/ same results. 
8315	2	0	0	The length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. The students should have specified the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length to start with. 
8316	2	0	0	The initial weigh of the materials and should have had the same amount stretched 20mm. But type b stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest of the four. ^p b) one way that the student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched. 
8317	2	0	0	The steps because it would have been easier to understand the data. 
8318	2	0	0	With the other plastic type. ^p b) they could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way it would have been easier to measure and conclude how much the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more trials. 
8319	2	0	0	By  doubling them, and they could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much each weight weighed. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much. 
8320	2	0	0	Others with 10 mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial it stretched 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) they could have timed it. 
8321	2	0	0	Closes to plastic b, c, and d only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. Therefore, it has the greatest stretchability. ^p the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic to use in the procedure. The length of the plastic, and describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp and how many weights should be added. Another thing that should have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not. 
8322	2	0	0	Named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make an easier comparison. 
8323	2	0	0	Data on a chat the the student did. 
8324	2	0	0	The limit for each plastic. 
8325	2	0	0	By may be using, more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it  stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions. They would of told the types of plastics. 
8326	2	0	0	To this data table plastic type b has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23 mm, which is the least out of all of the other plastics in both trials. B) the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more weight in the second trial. One way the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp. 
8327	2	0	0	Least stretchable at an average of 11mm while type b stretched an average of 7.3 units longer in t1 and 8 units in t3.^p (b)in their procedure they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They could have said how much weight the put on the plastics. Another way the student could have added more trials and recorded the average of the t1 and t2. A conclusion based on the data, plastic tube ''d'' stretched the most, a way to improve this experiment i believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type a was the same. ^p b. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less. 
8328	2	0	0	For stretchability because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. Also another way is to add a specific amount of weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of being stretched. In trial 1 plastic type b stretched the most because it is thin and that type a streched the least at 22mm. ^p the student could have improved the experiment by using different weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on. 
8329	2	0	0	Specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing that should have been done is use less time. The most flexible however, was plastic type a. ^p i think that this experiment could be to perform more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and compare notes. 
8330	2	0	0	The plastic strips were before and after the experiment, they would known how much weight to put in the clamp and have it be the same or different. 
8331	2	0	0	Of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability plastic b is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic a, b stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type c shrink and type d remained the same. A second would be showing the length of the materials before doing the experiment, the best plastic based on stretchability would be plastic b. It started at 10 and to t2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""a it stretched 2mm"". ^p b0 the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable. 
8332	2	0	0	By mentioning how many weights they used. 
8333	2	0	0	Does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom. 
8334	2	0	0	Students could improve there expirement, is by being more specific and also measured the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the weights. 
8335	2	0	0	And eaiser to understand. Another thing could they could have done was added a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment. 
8336	2	0	0	You put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The data show in trial one it only stretched about 4mm and in trial two it was stretched 1mm. And type c lost 1 mm and finally type d could stretch the most, as it stretched 20mm in each trial. Also the plastic type d was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p they could have used more trials and they might get better results. 
8337	2	0	0	Polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p b) one way the student could have added more time. 
8338	2	0	0	In both ones plastic type b has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b. ) to improve the validity. A second way is to be more exact on the amount of trials there are in your experiment. 
8339	2	0	0	Stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm. The students could have improved is by adding more trials to the experiment. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to vary the time for  the trials. 
8340	2	0	0	Since there were four different types of plastic. 
8341	2	0	0	Student could have used more weights on the second trial. But one way the students could have improved on the experiment design and validity of the results would be inaccurate. 2. They could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have explained how much do the weights weighed. They also could have been more specific on what they did. And the students can based in that data table the t2 is more stretched than t1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic. The student could have been more specific about  what type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time. "
8342	2	0	0	Sample b plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity. Another way to improve the lab is instead of two trials do three. Find waay is have a control grone. 
8343	2	0	0	Adding a third trial. Another conclusion would be that t2 got more results than t1. Two ways that the students could have kept adding weight to see how far it would on. 
8344	2	0	0	And  23 mm for trial two. Plastic type b stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic is plastic type a had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type a whas stretchability is very low. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also say how much weight i am adding at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom of the plastic types. In both trials the plastic stretched further or stayed the same. ^p they should've been more specific with their table. The students concluded plastic b can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic a can stretch the least. In trial one and 23mm in trial b. Two ways the students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are. 
8345	2	0	0	Trial for plastics a, b, c and d have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way that the experimental design could be to specify the original length of each plastic. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third trial. Also i would try adding more trials with different weights, or the strongest. Another way to have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table. 
8346	2	0	0	Of weight as put on all the plastics and put in the data table. 
8347	2	0	0	Procedure they should tell you how long the type of plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic. ^p b) one way this experimental design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights. And a second way the student could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making a larger graph to show the difference of the plastic before it was stretched. He could have specified on how many weights they used for each trial & each plastic. Finally, the student could improve their experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic. 
8348	2	0	0	Of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same length of each plastic, making it the weakest type of plastic. The student could tested the plastic a third time to see which of the highest two were right. A second way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they could say what the starting length of the plastic. They should have added more weights to the plastics to see how much long the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials. 
8349	2	0	0	Or they could have let the weights hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes. 
8350	2	0	0	And stretch the plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics. ^p hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the and of the plastic. 
8351	2	0	0	To be used as stretchability. ^p to ensure accuracy of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is perfectly correct and by making sure the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement. (2) measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers. 
8352	2	0	0	Done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results. 
8353	2	0	0	Could of allowed the clamp to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. The other 3 plastic type c streched 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for both trials. Plastic type 'd' seems to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b. The students can also add a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results. 
8354	2	0	0	Design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The plastics as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid. 
8355	2	0	0	Length in millimeters after the experiment. Another way to improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the students could have improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly. 
8356	2	0	0	Polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they are adding on at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much each type of plastic (a, b, c or d. He also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same amount of weights for each type. 
8357	2	0	0	Results were not valid. They should have stated what four types of plastic a and c stretched more. Plastic type a would be the stretchiest. The student could also have made the amount of weight the student added to the clamp each time. This means it has less elasticity than the other types. ^p b) to improve the experimental design by letting it hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the paper. 
8358	2	0	0	Used random lengths and weights for each trial. The second polymer had the greatest stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. ^p hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the and of the plastic. 
8359	2	0	0	Types of plastic in both of its trials and plastic type a stretches the least amount of stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant. 
8360	2	0	0	It different one another. ^p another way to improve thes results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes, and 2. They should used more types of plastics. The student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, control. Then the plastic with the weights. 
8361	2	0	0	Could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
8362	2	0	0	Improve validity of the experiment, the type of plastic they were using for each. They also should have run more than two trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic. 
8363	2	0	0	Weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way to improve the experimentol design would be to measure the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. Also, they could have named the plastics. Another way is to use the same table for all four plastics. Also, the students would have improved their experimental design / validity of their results. 
8364	2	0	0	Put heavy products in because it is more durable. Two ways to improve the experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the 4 plastics, and not just bathe them a, b, and c. The students could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min. 
8365	2	0	0	Have specified what they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over. 
8366	2	0	0	Could have done this over distinct results. The student could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic that has has the most stretchability during both trials. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""a"" two ways students could have improved their experiment is by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, the students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should had left more minutes to hang. 
8367	2	0	0	That can be based off the student's data is plastic type b, stretched out more unlike 2 and b, stretched the most, 22 and 23 mm, respectively. When discussing the validity of the results is to make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same length. 
8368	2	0	0	A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Another conclusion one could draw is that plastic type b was the more stretchable plastic. It only stretched an average of 21mm while plastics a and c stretched more. Plastic type a was the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way they could of improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many  he used. 
8369	2	0	0	Of measuring different lengths to start with. 
8370	2	0	0	B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm. ^p b) one way the student could have improved on this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details. 
8371	2	0	0	Trials to get more valid results. 
8372	2	0	0	Whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every trial. Also, add more details to the procedure. 
8373	2	0	0	The students data would be that plastic type a stretches the least amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. One way the student could have improved was by telling us how much weight it could have taken to stretch, as well as done more than two trials. 
8374	2	0	0	First way to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant. Plastic type b stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. I know this because plastic b had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the others on the data table. The student could also improve it by using a set amount of weight, the plastics stretched. A second way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. He could change ""bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""edge of the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, then show how long they got. 
8375	2	0	0	The same from t2 to t2. ^p b. One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic. Another improvement would live to add the same amount of weight for each type. 
8376	2	0	0	Measure they should list the units they wanna use. 
8377	2	0	0	Weight for each bag and trial. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial. "
8378	2	0	0	Second would be what would you measure the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would have made the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23.
8379	2	0	0	Weighs being added to the clamp. 
8380	2	0	0	Of time it hangs. 
8381	2	0	0	Have possibly added more weight to there experiment. 
8382	2	0	0	 they also could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, they could of improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights. "
8383	2	0	0	Could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. B two way i think the students could of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes on to the clamp. 
8384	2	0	0	Be improved if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant. 
8385	2	0	0	Have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
8386	2	0	0	Of plastics were each. He also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data from the two trials. ^p b. The student could've listed the starting length of the plastic. 
8387	2	0	0	A fresh sample for each trial, the results show that plastic b was the most stretchy. ^p b) the student should've measured before stretching is to make, things go along more smoothly. 
8388	2	0	0	Also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate. 
8389	2	0	0	Listing what weight to use and had more tests and trials. 
8390	2	0	0	And not just a, b,c &d. 2.  They could tell us how much the weights weigh (4). Another way he/she could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials and specify what kind of weights to use. For example, plastic b etc. Also to have accurate data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is b, d, c, d witch make it more resistant then the rest. ^p (b)the students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it holds. 
8391	2	0	0	Trial 2 shows that the plastic types did not stretch as far. ^p 2 ways the student could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same. 
8392	2	0	0	Experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing they could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was. 
8393	2	0	0	Sample of plastic d stretch the most but of the four plastics. 2b) use different sizes weights for the trial to see if their is a difference in data. 
8394	2	0	0	Types used in the experiment. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students could have improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also include the length of the plastic was before the experiments. He should of also said how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic. 
8395	2	0	0	One was really the stretchiest and should have added the exact same weight for all the plastic together instead of doing it separate, they could have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also can use different kinds of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics. 
8396	2	0	0	Made during the first run through of the test. 
8397	2	0	0	Had 20 for t1 and t2. For validity the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight by its self.

8400	2	0	0	Earth peice of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width. 
8401	2	0	0	See anything that they couldhave done differently. 
8402	2	0	0	Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples. 
8403	2	0	0	 it stretched 23mm, however, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways these students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips. To improve this lab are: have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results to a plastic used. It took the least amount of resistance to be streched, plastic bag type a had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. ^p they could increase the amount of trials there are in your experiment. 
8404	2	0	0	They were using as weight. And another way they could have improved the experiment by telling you how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, the student should have stated how much weight was being added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic. 
8405	2	0	0	Type b is not. Plastic type a stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the bags. 
8406	2	0	0	To conduct more trials, second, the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic was stretch more than others. The data show in trial one it stretched 22mm, and in t2 it only strech 12, i can also conclued that plastic type d would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data shown plastic type b was the stretchest plastic type because in trial 1 plastic type b stretched the most. ^p b) to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) data certain leng
8407	2	0	0	Tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample a increased 2mm from t1 to t2. Sample d stayed the same. Also to improve their validity of the experiment. "
8408	2	0	0	Stretched only a bit more than plastic a. On trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 stretched 12mm. ^p (b) two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the students could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot. 
8409	2	0	0	Measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid. 
8410	2	0	0	They had more to compare. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.

8416	2	0	0	Eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have correct information. ^p b) one way the students could have improved this experimental design by adding more trials to see more accracy. 
8417	2	0	0	Stretched the farthest amount. One way the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase. 
8418	2	0	0	To 23 mm at most. Plastic c stretched an average of 11mm, type c stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial plastic type b stretched the most and is most flexible. ^p b) to improve there experimental design and validity of the results would be inaccurate. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results. "
8419	2	0	0	Least elastic and that plastic a streatched the least. ^p b. To improve their experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing they could have done more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth. 
8420	2	0	0	Plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on the amount stretched. 
8421	2	0	0	The second would be what would you measure the plastic. They could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate. 
8422	2	0	0	Some plastics could be stretched by weights. 
8423	2	0	0	The plastuc types c, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (b) two ways this exparement could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. 
8424	2	0	0	The plastic more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p b) i think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having a catrol
8425	2	0	0	Are using a new set of the same plastic for second trial. ^p the conclusion on for experiment is that plastic d stretched the same amount also that t2 was better. Two ways they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for each trial. ^p (b) the students could improve the experiment would be that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p (b) one way the student could have improved the validity of the data. 
8426	2	0	0	1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: they should have mentioned this in the table.

8441	2	0	0	Two more mm and the rest did not stretch as far. ^p two ways the students' could have improved their experimental design is to add more trials, also adding the amount of weights to the plastic like in the procedure, the first would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials and add more weights on the plastic. The second time on used heavier weights during te second trial. 
8442	2	0	0	10mm than 12mm while plastic b stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic a had the greatest amount of streach ability. ^p b) the students should have made the plastic sample all the same length. 
8443	2	0	0	An improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length. Also must have had the same starting length. ^p my conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could improve this experiment by having a constant amount of weight. 
8444	2	0	0	The size and shape of the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid. 
8445	2	0	0	That all bags tend to stretch when carrying weights. In the future i think it would be helpful for the students to record how much they stretched. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. This is ture because plastic a stretched the most.

8447	2	0	0	Made sure it was the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. 
8448	2	0	0	Type c stretched the most while plastic c shrunk an inch and d did not have very different results, b stretched the most. ^p this students could  improve this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, the students only put what i assume the end length of the marble. Nothing can really be told with this information. ^p (b) they could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials, more attempts & more accurate results. 
8449	2	0	0	Most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type a stretched the least. Two ways the students could improve the experimental design is to say how much weight to put on the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they should include how many weights should be added to the plastic samples. The same amount of weight is used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be taped on top of the clamps. The results could have done more trails or they could have let the weights hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes. 
8450	2	0	0	Plastics out of all of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch.

8504	2	0	0	Stretched the same in t2. While a stretched 2mm and b stretched 1mm and plastic d didn't stretch. One way the student could have improve the experiment by having more than two trials for each type to make sure findings were acurate, and to say the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the plastic type that stretched the least has plastic a. ^p b, two ways the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials. So the only affected ones were plastic type a, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types b+c have the same stretchability, and d has almost the same stretch as b. ^p b) the student should have told us how much the weights weigh. 
8505	2	0	0	Should be a required standard length for each type of plastic type used in this experiment. "
8506	2	0	0	Was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type b stretched out the most. Plastic type a was the least^p b. The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. ^p the students could have improved their was by added more trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights, within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type b stretched the most out of all the other plastics results that were tested were in between. ^p b. One way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one. 
8507	2	0	0	By lableing how much weight was being applied.

8516	2	0	0	Data plastic type a and b increased two or one mm. For plastic c the longer length was 14 in the first trail. One number lower than the first time. The students could have been more specific with the plastic types. It stretched nearly twice as much as the other two types. This shows that a is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the 4 they tested in both trials. ^p another way to improve this experiment would he to use the same mass for the plastic hags. 
8517	2	0	0	Create intervals of time to show the results.

8519	2	0	0	 indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: c & d either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. They also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, control. Then the second plastic (plastic d) would strech the farthest. ^p b) the student should be clear about the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched. 
8520	2	0	0	The names of each type of plastic. Based of the plastic are t1,t2 their amount stretched (mm). ^p b) two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials.

Also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics as it stretched the most mm than t1.^p b) the student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid. 
8526	2	0	0	She should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors, and more trials would lead to more accurate data.

To improve the validity of the results is by one, telling us how fare to hang it of the table, to make sure that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. ^p (b) they could have did more trials because the more they do, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, plastic a stretched the least and plastic type b stretches the most for both trials. ^p b) the students could improve their experiment is to record, the starting length of the plastic.

8533	2	0	0	The experimental design in two ways by having a control sample plastic a, b,c, and d and also the student could have improved his procedure are, he could have measured the length of the plastic befor they started streching. 
8534	2	0	0	Weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same. 
8535	2	0	0	Second least while plastic type d is the most durable plastic. ^p the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, in step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how much it stretched. 
8536	2	0	0	On the results plastic b is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was be, first of all, describing what kind of tape, how much it stretched. 
8537	2	0	0	Students investigation is that plastic type b is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types of plastic. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more than the trial 2. D they are equal. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results would be to test different amounts of weight. They could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid. 
8538	2	0	0	Measure this you would have made the experiment more conclusive. 
8539	2	0	0	2mm of the first ti. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. Also, the student could have improved their expiremental design by one, keeping the amount of weight being added. 
8540	2	0	0	 based on this student's data, plastic type b stretched the furthest with 22 mm on t1 and 23 in t2 c streched 14 in t1 and 13 t2. D streched 20 in t1 and 20 in t2. So the are that streched most was plastic b which results were 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2. The one that least stretched was plastic type a. However, a was the least streechyest at of all the other plastic types stretched as much, plastic d held the most weight. One way the student could have put weights in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; b was more stretchable than c. ^p (b) instead of letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways. 
8541	2	0	0	 they have to do the experiment for different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. 
8542	2	0	0	The some give or take a few. The student should also keep the number of weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right. 
8543	2	0	0	Because its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p (b) the students could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on the clamps. 
8544	2	0	0	 or stayed the same. ^p (b)two ways the student could have set an exact length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight was used, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth. 
8545	2	0	0	They should of had a control group. 
8546	2	0	0	And more about the size.

8548	2	0	0	Result of our testing type b stretched the longest while plastic a stretched an average 11mm, plastic c the third most and plastic a the least most. The students could have improved the experiment design. Also, the weight added to the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch. Plastic type a has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. ^p b) the student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weight pulling on it. 
8549	2	0	0	Original length of plastic to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do the experiment for different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic were originally. 
8550	2	0	0	Up at one except plastic type d that stoped the same length. Also the trials have different results of type a, b,c and d had different results. The plastics also must all be the same size at the start of the experiment. "
8551	2	0	0	They put tape on top of the bag. ^p b) the student could have added more weights. ^p waited more times. 
8552	2	0	0	Trials instead of two. 
8553	2	0	0	Better in two ways, they could hold more trials to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also, the should have use different weights.

8559	2	0	0	Measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see, plastic b is able to stretch the farthest (t1:22mm, t2:23mm) and plastic a stretched the least. B) two ways [the students could have improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample. 
8560	2	0	0	It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data, plastic type b had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. ^p it would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the wieghts were. 
8561	2	0	0	All plastic pieces be the same length. Could have let the weights hang on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to make the weights added to the clamp. Also the student should have made each plastic the same length in both trials. 
8562	2	0	0	Procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the students did another trial to make that the results are valid. They could have specified the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion i can draw from the student's data is plastic type b, trial two out measured a, c and d. ^p (b) two ways the student could have improved their design is to have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been good to improve the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the plastic after it was tested. 
8563	2	0	0	Out the least out of all. I can also see that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type d, averaging 20 mm, plastic d came next followed by plastic c then a. The student did not have a control variable. ^p the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, the student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table and the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same length. Also must have had the same amount of tape for each plastic type. ^p one way they could have improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is that the plastic that can stretch the most without bearing to
8564	2	0	0	Plastic type a which stretches only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least during the experiment. Another way their experiment could be, add another trial to get accurate results. The results could have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial, and measure how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Also the trials have different results of type a, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types b+c have the same stretchability, and d. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design is to add make we4ight to the second trial. Plastic type a is stronger than the rest. ^p b) one thing he could have done more trials since their results between the two trials with plastic type d coming on close. ^p b. In the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use. 
8565	2	0	0	 also adding the amount of weights added for stretching. 
8566	2	0	0	This can also improve by adding a control and using the same length of plastic for each trial. 
8567	2	0	0	Is the one in c. ^p they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples). 
8568	2	0	0	Stretchable unlike type a which is the least out of all 4 plastics. One way the students could have added more plastic types and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time. This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. 
8569	2	0	0	Is plastic a because it was stretched longer than any other plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic. I also think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they put on the clamps. 
8570	2	0	0	Appears to have the greatest amount of stretchability in all the four plastics, type b had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic a had the least with 10mm and 12mm. This is because b had stretched to 22 mm while plastic d only stretched to 20mm and c to 14mm. In trial a it reached 10mm and in trial b it reached to 12mm. ^p b)two ways that those students could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control group. 
8571	2	0	0	Mention how many weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. According to the data plastic type b stretched the most and plastic ""a"" stretched the low. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to have described how much height to use. For example sample a and c must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p b) they could of had more results. 
8572	2	0	0	Because they eld most stretch as far  when the weights were added, each how much weight was added. This is a difference of about 10mm. ^p b) they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic for the same reasons. 
8573	2	0	0	How much each weights were added on. As well the student could have improved the experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. Also, he could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching. 
8574	2	0	0	Tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. They also should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student also would have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the average not the results. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches. 
8575	2	0	0	With 10mm and 12 mm. Two wats the student could of improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight was pulling on the plastic. 
8576	2	0	0	Stretchability while plastic a had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial plastic type b stretched the longest in (t1) to (t2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could have improved the experiment design. Also, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table. 
8577	2	0	0	Use the most durable tape you can find strong duet tape will probably be fine. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added so that all the types of plastic were. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples'', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure. "
8578	2	0	0	22mm in the first trial it stretched 22mm and t2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length, how much it stretched the other way would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. ^p 2. Make sure all the plastic types used in the experiment. Two things that could have been done is use less time. The students could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure. 
8579	2	0	0	Much about how much they exactly stretched, the students should of told us how many weights to add when stretched. 
8580	2	0	0	Explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it. 
8581	2	0	0	They all increase other than one (plastic type). I can see that most of the experiments change on the second trial but the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type a at 10 and 12mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity, the student could have improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and by specifying how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.

8585	2	0	0	Proven to be the most durable. It had the most amount stretched and plastic type a has the least stretchability. ^p the students could have improved the experimental design would be to state how much weight to be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the experiment is to specify in how many weights they used. Without the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic is how much weight is used. 
8586	2	0	0	Hav the least tensile strength, is plastic d, because during both trials it stretched 22 and t2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic b. ^p for one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of it to hold the plastic. 
8587	2	0	0	The procedure and state why they are doing it, and finally they could have measure it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way to improve the experiment is that they could have said what the starting measure of the plastic. 
8588	2	0	0	In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size. 
8589	2	0	0	The most it had stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, and 25mm in the second trial stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. ^p one way the student could have improved the experimental design is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much it stretched. 
8590	2	0	0	Chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it can be a good grade or data count. 
8591	2	0	0	At least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way would be writting down how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. And 2) add more trials, adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly. "
8592	2	0	0	For another five minutes and measured it again afterwards. 
8593	2	0	0	The highest stretchability and plastic type a is the most non-flexible and the most durable to use b. One ways they could of improved the experimental design by determining a consistent starting area for all of plastics, type b and c were the second best stretchability. The least amount stretched. The student also could have made sure all the plastic pieces are the same size and length. 
8594	2	0	0	 also i would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight. "
8595	2	0	0	Making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, and measure how far the plastic will hang off from the table. The students also need to use the same plastic each trial, the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in. 
8596	2	0	0	The plastic bags type d had the same amount stretched 20mm. ^p b) the students could have improved the experiment design was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if i want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then i would have gotten something different. 
8597	2	0	0	After trial 1 it was 14mm long and in trial two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm. Type b stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type b and c stretched one mm, and plastic a stretched the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p (b) the students could have improved the experiment by using different weights so they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could have added more plastic types and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.

Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials. 
8601	2	0	0	Be to cut all out polymers to the same length and width before each of them were stretched. The student also, should've verified the weight of the clamp weights. "
8602	2	0	0	Other half with none. 
8603	2	0	0	Data gathered by the students i have come to conclusion that plastic b is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type a stretched the least. In try one a stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to show the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks. Another way they could have improved the experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same amount. The first three steps of the experiment are, specify
8604	2	0	0	For 12 it is again plastic type b at 33cm. So it is the same amount of weights for each plastic. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for both trials. Plastic type a had stretched the least amount in both trials, the experiment doesn't show the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data. 
8605	2	0	0	1mor millameter greater in the second trial. Plastic type 'd' had the most stretchability followed by type c then type a being the least stretchiest^p b)the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to understand the difference of both experiment/ second would be to conduct more trials, so i can confidently conclude this. To improve their experimental design is to have been more specific in their procedure. They should mention/ add the weight of each weight, and by adding more weight to the cup and then they could have just added until the plastic ripped. 
8606	2	0	0	For more than 5 minutes, another would be to indicate the amount of weight added to the clamp. Right now there is no constant in the experiment. Another way it would have been better is to tell the reader how much plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length before starting the experiment. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. 
8607	2	0	0	The othes 3 plastic types because plastic type got 22 and 23 mm for each trial and plastic, because they went up the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because i had predicted plastic a would have the most stretchability but it didn't. ^p (b)1.put something heavier then weights. (2)attach something other then a clamp. 
8608	2	0	0	T1 at 10mm and t2 at 23mm. ^p they could have done so, by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. The student could have possibly added more weight to it. The independent variable is the type of plastic that decreased the length. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.

8612	2	0	0	Had the same length when the experiment initiated. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp and letting it hang for more time, another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that.

8617	2	0	0	To 3 mm with type d that has the second most stretchability followed by type a. In t1, a stretched 10mm and in t2 it stretched 23mm. The student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same length before they begin the experiment. He could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise. 
8618	2	0	0	A stretched 10mm in trial 1 and trial 2. ^p (b) record the weight that was added to the clamps. 
8619	2	0	0	Same which was at 20. ^p the student could have improved his experiment is by doing at least one more trial. Both would help improve the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. They also could have done more trials. 
8620	2	0	0	Experiment by doing a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials. 
8621	2	0	0	Polymer is type b. ^p b) more trials. They could of improved the design of the experiment is to add more for starts such as same starting length of plastics. Thing this
8622	2	0	0	Plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p the students expirement was not valid. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results would be to use a specific # of weights and or time of the trials. (2) if they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights. 
8623	2	0	0	Greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, plastic type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm. On the other hand plastic type a streched the least, making it the weakest plastic. ^p 2. Have a control group and performed more trials. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure. 
8624	2	0	0	Was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way the student could have improved is by having a third trial as well. This will improve validity as well. 
8625	2	0	0	Data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same, growing, or shortening. The students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results is, first by making the procedures more clear. Second, to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how much the clamps and the student should have done at least 3 or more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it more difficult to stretch. B. They could of also mentioned the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. It helps the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and the amount of weights a
8626	2	0	0	Than just the length. 
8627	2	0	0	Next highest amount stretched, while plastic type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm in trial one and in trial two. ^p two ways this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic, the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched. 
8628	2	0	0	Second change would be to put the same amount of tape on each type of plastic is on the graph. They also could have added on more weight over a period of time. 
8629	2	0	0	More weights and added a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic that stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results. A constant variable was not included. 
8630	2	0	0	1 way to improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to use for in the experiment. This is what can be concluded from the data, we could see that plastic type b had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial 2. Plastic type a was the only type of plastic that had the same length of plastic for all trials and types, and add a control to the experiment. 
8631	2	0	0	Also another way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for plastic type ""d"" the plastic length stayed the same in these trials. Type d stayed the same. The student could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights on the plastic. 
8632	2	0	0	Weights it took so the plastic would stretch more. The student did not have a control variable. ^p the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same length. 
8633	2	0	0	Average out the stretchability. 
8634	2	0	0	A stretched the farthest out of all the tested plastics. It also could have measured after a longer amount of time. 
8635	2	0	0	5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type c which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type d: stayed the same. Also, the second trial all of the plastic type (a, b,c, d) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length so it would be a politer polymer. They could have organized their data alot better. 
8636	2	0	0	Than polymers such as a and c so therefore, b and c were all longer than t1. ^p 3b. The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic a & b increased on the second trial a stretched 23mm. The plastic that least stretched was plastic type a. ^p i, the students should make sure that the size of the plastic samples used. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each, 
8637	2	0	0	To make his more more clear or valid. 
8638	2	0	0	Because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be to test for longer amount of time. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. For example, plastic a is the most durable and strongest plastic. In the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial than in the first trial and 23mm the second, while plastic a was the strongest. The student could improve the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to perform more trials to receive a more acuret answer. 
8639	2	0	0	Each trial and plastic, because they went up the second time. Plastic c shrunk as weight was added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial. "
8640	2	0	0	They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all coming from same temperature. 
8641	2	0	0	Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight. ^p (2) use a different conteince. 
8642	2	0	0	Adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights. 
8643	2	0	0	Data should that plastic b stretched the most. It was the strongest the first and second trial. One way this lab could do is to add more trials. 
8644	2	0	0	And t2 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have done 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more interesting. 
8645	2	0	0	With the plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity. Another way is by being more specific and also measured the length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time). 
8646	2	0	0	Which stretched the longest, plastic a stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p b. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight is being added to the plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the plastic. 
8647	2	0	0	That could help here. 
8648	2	0	0	To step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic"". "
8649	2	0	0	Drew from this experiment is that plastic type b is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials. It's the stretchiest. Based on the students data, it is actually impossible to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other plastic types. ^p b. Two ways that the student could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used and if it was the same each time. 
8650	2	0	0	Two ways i believe the student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have wrote the weight of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, finally stops. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is to add more trials. Another way to improve the validity of this experiment could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid. 
8651	2	0	0	Of had more trials so they could of had a third trial to increase the validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials. 
8652	2	0	0	Only differed by 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials. 
8653	2	0	0	 there for it stretched the greatest amount of streach ability. ^p b) the student must have added a control and performed more trials. 
8654	2	0	0	By adding more ways to stretch the plastic until it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth. 
8655	2	0	0	That plastic a is the stretchiest. After that came a plastic d with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic b with 2205mm stretched. The student could improve the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by making more trials and making sure they measured the same amount of weights. ( we didn't know the weight of the weights listed somewhere. 
8656	2	0	0	Stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: c & d either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. B. They could have repeated the experiment a third time, and uses one more plastic. 
8657	2	0	0	Tape such as stables or tieing it. Another way they could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. They would do one more trial to make the experiment more vigor. ^p 2) the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that everything is constant. 
8658	2	0	0	All chances of error. 
8659	2	0	0	Will stretch the furthest. ^p how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student may also perform more trials in order to get the correct results. 
8660	2	0	0	Long do they want the plastic stretched. ^p b. One way the student could improve this is by using the same size plastic strips for each type. Should it be the same weight for each trial. 
8661	2	0	0	For trial one and trial two. ^p two ways they could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in t1 is used in t2.
8662	2	0	0	It stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. The second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial as shown on the data table. 
8663	2	0	0	Of plastic use for all 4 plastic used. It took the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. They could have explained how much do the weights weighed. Also they could have used a control
8664	2	0	0	 which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic b stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic c is the weakest out of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime. 
8665	2	0	0	Data is neccary to make just numbers on a graph to data. 
8666	2	0	0	And trials were all about the same thing. ^p hang, the clamps are. 
8667	2	0	0	Kept the measure of plastic samples consistant. 
8668	2	0	0	Say the type of plastic used. It took the least amount of resistance to be streched. ^p b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. He or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results. 
8669	2	0	0	Would be labeling the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic b. ^p b) the student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time. 
8670	2	0	0	Expiremental design by one, telling us how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the exact amount of weight to add for step 4. Also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do?

8672	2	0	0	Susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic a stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Two ways these students could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of each plastic shows the same. ^p b) two ways the student could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weights for each plastic. 
8673	2	0	0	Plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to see how it improve. 
8674	2	0	0	The most weights and plastic type a stretched the least. ^p (b) make all original lengths equal i add the same weights to each plastic. The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. 
8675	2	0	0	 it stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p the student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the amount of weight added onto the clamps. 
8676	2	0	0	A appeared to have streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved their experiments would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of these factors affected the experiment. 
8677	2	0	0	Need a control with no weight added and a third trial. 
8678	2	0	0	Student have to do to validify the results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type a held the least. Plastic c can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic d being the second longest and a having the shortest amount stretched. Two, say how much weight he used to put on the clamp for future reference. 
8679	2	0	0	Variables were affecting the results of the experiments. 
8680	2	0	0	Can go until it breaks. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. 
8681	2	0	0	Was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. The results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time. 
8682	2	0	0	Another five minutes and measured it again afterwards. 
8683	2	0	0	That the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, the results would have tried different time lengths. Maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Also, he/she could have also used the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar. 
8684	2	0	0	Plastic type or running more trials. They also can have more trials to see more accracy. 
8685	2	0	0	Never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same both trials. ^p b)two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do three more so the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results, plastic type 'd' had the most stretchability while plastic type a had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. ^p (b) they should have recorded the length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time). 
8686	2	0	0	Sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table. 
8687	2	0	0	Validity of the trial, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
8688	2	0	0	Having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much weight they put on the plastic was equal and how far they taped the plastic on the table. 
8689	2	0	0	Length compared to the other plastics while plastic c did not stretch at all. A validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off. 
8690	2	0	0	And take more time to change the data table. The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific amount of weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, i. F. Shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp so it can stretch more. 
8691	2	0	0	Was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the other plastics. Two ways the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy. 
8692	2	0	0	More strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their results is how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types. ^p b) the student needs to record, and keep it constant. The results are clearly not valid. 
8693	2	0	0	Plastic b can stretch the most. Its t1 was 22 and t2 was 23 is stretched the most weights in 5 minutes. ^p b. Two ways that they could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight. 
8694	2	0	0	1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference. ^p b)
8695	2	0	0	Of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart, each trial for plastics a, b, c are almost similar but plastic d stretched the same amount in each trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could improve their experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic was type b. Because it stretched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many weights they attached and make sure all of them are the same size and use the same weight to stretch. B. ) two ways that the students could of put what kind of plastic and weights. 
8696	2	0	0	Off with all the plastic types. It stretched 20mm while plastic a only stretched 12 mm. ^p b. To improve the validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the plastics, and never change it. 
8697	2	0	0	But type b stretched 20cm but type b stretched the most, while sample d had the most stretchability out of all the plastic, since stretchability is being tested. 
8698	2	0	0	The worst because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the amount stretched was 23mm. But for type c it stretchability went down, t1 14mm and t2 13mm. ^p the students didn't tell how big the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. 
8699	2	0	0	You remove the weights and clamp weighed. Another way is to say exactly how much weight is being added to the clamp. 
8700	2	0	0	 to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched. 
8701	2	0	0	1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length would improve the validity, is to write down the initial length of the plastic samples. 
8702	2	0	0	Because plastic type a was the stretchiest. One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to include exactly what plastics were used. How long was the length of the plastic was in the begining. 
8703	2	0	0	To be more precise. 
8704	2	0	0	Polymer structous than a and c because plastics b and d are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now a and c are not very stretchy. ^p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic. 
8705	2	0	0	Plastic d was the strongest. For the plastic c and d, with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic c stretched an average 13.5mm and type d stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is to have more trials and also tested different amounts of weights and this would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p also, they could of also explained how plastic types become smaller. 
8706	2	0	0	 while type a stretched 12mm. ^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging. 
8707	2	0	0	Used for every plastic sample constant. Also they should of used the same amount of weight to add to the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic b stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. On the other hand is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic d is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and t2 it stretched 23. Plastic type d stretched the most which means it is made of the strongest polymers. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by saying how many weighs should be added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight should be used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they used to get this results they got; and the way, just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify how long each plastic start, as
8708	2	0	0	Have chase two different plastics to see how much weight it can hold. Another way they could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min. 
8709	2	0	0	The student could told you what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break. 
8710	2	0	0	Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable. 
8711	2	0	0	Clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights. 
8712	2	0	0	The data table is that plastic type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm. Type a was the least. Plastic types b and d are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas a and c are a little stronger plastics than b and d because the both a and c stretched less than b and d because the both a and c stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type a stretched 12mm. So therefore type b and type d were pretty close to one another. Also do we use the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table. This would have made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact mass of the weights used. Another thing they could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic was used for the experiment. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time. 
8713	2	0	0	Of weights and or time of the trials. ^p the student should have wrote in the measurements of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add. 
8714	2	0	0	Of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end. 
8715	2	0	0	Smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design! Validity of the results the student could have had another trial to test validity. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over. 
8716	2	0	0	Much preasure would be on the clamps. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use. 
8717	2	0	0	Amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. And change the trials. 
8718	2	0	0	The first trial as shown on the data table plastic type b stretched the most. By giving the measurement of plastic used for each trial & each plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results werent valid. 
8719	2	0	0	A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial and 23mm the second trial. 
8720	2	0	0	Telling the day or hour of the experiment, the students would have improved their experimental design would be by adding weights and letting them hang for 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight. 
8721	2	0	0	His experiment and get similar results. 
8722	2	0	0	She could say how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weight, the results will not be accurate. 
8723	2	0	0	A with t1 being 10mm and t2 12 mm. T2 plastic b stretched 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of the four. One way the could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in t1 is used in t2.
8724	2	0	0	Weight on the different types of plastics. 
8725	2	0	0	Plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p b) the student could have also included to use the same amount of weights are used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The design could be improved is to explain how c was unstretched. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes to see if more time is givin will it strech more. 
8726	2	0	0	Weights a specific number so that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weight for the second trial plastic types a and c. Both b and d stretched an average 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics should be in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch. 
8727	2	0	0	Type of plastic being used 2. What kind of weights are being used. 
8728	2	0	0	Try it once more. ^p b) one thing the student's could have added a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. It would have been good to improve the experiment would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to stretch the most. Plastic type b was the best kind of plastic in this experiment. ^p b) i believe they should have identify the different plastics. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of the students plastic b was stretched out the most because it had the highest measurements for both trials. They also should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. ^p another way the design could have been improved by adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics. 
8729	2	0	0	Provide the names of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate. 
8730	2	0	0	22mm on trial one and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b. ) the student could improve was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic"". "
8731	2	0	0	Well as improve the design. 
8732	2	0	0	Types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p one way the stretches could have improved there testing could be to. 
8733	2	0	0	Of put the size of the plastic samples, how much weight do they put to the end of the plastic. 
8734	2	0	0	 the clamps are. 
8735	2	0	0	Let the weights hang on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces. 
8736	2	0	0	That all polymers stretch. ^p b) two ways to improve the experiment is do more trial and tell us how much weight they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment. ^p b) these students should have conducted a third trial. And a second way the student could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same length for each. 
8737	2	0	0	Weight he added to the clamp in each trial. They could of improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, i can conclude that some of the plastics, also they could of put more weight on the plastic. 
8738	2	0	0	Plastic b only stretched 1, plastic d did not stretch much. Type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm. On the first trial, and a, respectively. ^p b) two ways the studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial. 
8739	2	0	0	Amount of stretched of t1 and t2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different. 
8740	2	0	0	Made sure they were all kept the same weight. 
8741	2	0	0	And for another improvement they could have one a third trial to ensure the validity of the experiment valid. 
8742	2	0	0	Stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.plastic d was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm. ^p b. Could have had 3 trials. I also believe that there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion would be that sample b is the stretchiest because it stretched out, a total of 40 mm plastic c was the second strongest, followed by plastic d, 10mm. ^p b) the student could had added more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer period of time. 
8743	2	0	0	This may not be valid because you don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. 
8744	2	0	0	The names of each type of plastic start at the same lengths and could have changed the experiment the which plastic is the strongest. B the students could have made this experiment more valid. Also the student could have used the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic. Finally, they need to include how much weight to add or what kind of weights are being used. 
8745	2	0	0	Over a longer period of time. 
8746	2	0	0	Trial i only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial. The student could have specified how much weight was put on them. 
8747	2	0	0	About to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. 
8748	2	0	0	Capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 12mm and plastic d stretched an average of 22.5mm. ^p b) the student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups. 
8749	2	0	0	Ongional measure of the plastic. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastics when the student first started. 
8750	2	0	0	Plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
8751	2	0	0	Measured the plastic before doing the experiment. 
8752	2	0	0	Trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. ^p b=the could have improved it was by putting weights in and making it heavier and the other one is you can also bring the plastic bags apart trying to rip them. 
8753	2	0	0	Have improve  the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure the students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit. 
8754	2	0	0	Can see that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types a stretched out about the same each trial except for plastic type c that decreased. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results to at the end. 
8755	2	0	0	Improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight to add to each plastic to ensure validity. 
8756	2	0	0	Have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started. 
8757	2	0	0	T1 to t2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials. 
8758	2	0	0	Stretching caused by the weights. Another way the test could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add. Also to improve their validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, therefore the type d plastic was the strongest. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment. 
8759	2	0	0	Had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific amount of weight to add to the clamp and allow them to hang for more time. 
8760	2	0	0	Type out of the four plastics. Two ways the students could have improved is by increasing the # of weights and clamps. The student could have improved by doing a third trial. The student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
8761	2	0	0	Bags take longer to stretch or/and break. 
8762	2	0	0	And collecting data i compared each result and i it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move. ^p a. From the experiment, you can conclude this because all other types had either1 mm length change, or no change but type a had a change of 2 mm. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight he used. Also the students could have done more trials. The students could conclude that plastic b was the strongest out of all the plastics, and never change it. 
8763	2	0	0	That was  capable stretching the most. The student could of improved the experiment was by making sure they used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it. 
8764	2	0	0	Most stretchability at 22 t1mm, 23m t2. And type c, followed by type c with a difference of 4-1mm with type b. Plastic type d stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^p one way the stretches could have improved there testing could be to. 
8765	2	0	0	Experiment this is apparent because in both trials, 22,23. Then type d with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The least stretched plastic was type a. It only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same. So the only affected ones were plastic type a, c, and finally type a. ^p to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same way twice in 3 trials. 
8766	2	0	0	Plastic gets weights in the same spot, start and end. 
8767	2	0	0	If it was accurate. 
8768	2	0	0	The procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for. 
8769	2	0	0	Mm plastic type d was exactly the sam. 
8770	2	0	0	To the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how much weight to add to each clamp. 
8771	2	0	0	 they both have over 20 mm in both trials. ^p b) the validity could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for five minutes. ^p b) one way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other 3 plastic types. Another way the could improve their experimental design, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to the groups and second, to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how much heights they put on the plastic. 
8772	2	0	0	What weight that was. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out. 
8773	2	0	0	Compared to all other the differant plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic. 
8774	2	0	0	Trial more reliable the student should have done more trials. They could have improved this was by telling us how much weight to put in the clamp and having the average of both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make it more accurate the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be hanging off the table. 
8775	2	0	0	Move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much. 
8776	2	0	0	Heavy the weights are and what type of plastic they were using. 
8777	2	0	0	Lenght in both that but plastic type a is the least stretchy. I do not, however, type a is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. ^p two ways they could improve the validity of the experiment is unknown. 
8778	2	0	0	How many of them to put on the clamps. 
8779	2	0	0	Recorded the length of the plastic. 
8780	2	0	0	D has the second most stretchability followed by type c, and d's stretchability with 25mm! ^p b) 1. He could've specified the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. The student could have improved the experimental design would be to tell what kind of plastic they used instead of saying a, b, c stretched less the second time while d stayed the same. This experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every trial. ^p b. Add different weights. 
8781	2	0	0	Constant length for all u. 
8782	2	0	0	Length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure. 
8783	2	0	0	Mm because the stretchyness. Either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students could have said how much weight to add to the plastic samples. 
8784	2	0	0	To both type of plastics and keep that weights longer. 
8785	2	0	0	 instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to average the figures from the trials. 
8786	2	0	0	Hard to get a good result and they could measure the plastic before he/she stretched it. 
8787	2	0	0	Same size and use the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results. 
8788	2	0	0	 the least stretched plastic was type a. ^p b. ) do another trial and then average out the results. 
8789	2	0	0	Experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more. 
8790	2	0	0	The two plastics that had stretched the most out of the four plastics while plastics a and c sustain their shape much better. The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also use a stop watch & be very presice about the time. 
8791	2	0	0	The second than in the first. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved their experiment by try one more time, for the second trial the first. ^p     2 be more detailed by how long they stretched the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight. ^p b) the student should specify the exact amount of weighs that was to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid. 
8792	2	0	0	To use for stretchability. ^p (b)students could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials and by using different kind of plastic and weights. 
8793	2	0	0	Could of improved there experiment is by more trials and to add what he is comparing to. 
8794	2	0	0	Stretch out the most. The student also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure. 
8795	2	0	0	To record anything that went wrong. Another way would've been to tell the reader how much weight to put on the clamps and also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time like 10 minutes. 
8796	2	0	0	Making them all the exact same size and to improve the validity of the experiment, one is todo more trials. They could of improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could of done was add more time. 
8797	2	0	0	Was also wrong because i had predicted plastic a would have the most stretchability. According to the students, in order to show that everything was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed and how many of them to put on the clamps and the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also they could of put the time period a little longer. Also for plastic type ""d"" the plastic length stayed the same, one way the student could have told how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights. 
8798	2	0	0	To be more specific in this procedure. For example how much weights were added. One way the students could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the bags. Another way they could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they used and if it was the same length. Also they should do another trial and let us know where each of the plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this. 
8799	2	0	0	Exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic measured before it was stretched. 
8800	2	0	0	That instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control. 
8801	2	0	0	Highest mm stretch  distance for both trials. B-they could repeat trials, and plastic type d reached 20mm. B) two ways in which the experiment could have improved is by recording the length of the string that was attached to the weights. 
8802	2	0	0	Happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample a had the least elastisity. ^p b) the first way is the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the table each piece of plastic, making it the weakest type of plastic. "
8803	2	0	0	And also to have a control. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible plastic a streches the least with an average of 20 mm, and d. And another way they could improve their experiment is by stating the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length and the weight added. 
8804	2	0	0	Student had a control which would be the measure of each sample of plastic at a constant length, therefor your results are more valid and clear. They also should have included the size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data. 
8805	2	0	0	Plastic were all at the same length of 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic a with 10mm in t1 and 12mm in t2.^p b. Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials. 
8806	2	0	0	For each type because this may affect the results. Explain why they added more weight. 
8807	2	0	0	Because some plastic stretched longer the second trial and that type c stretched longer the first and d stayed the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results decreased by one mm. Plastic b stretched on aver age 22 mm, and d plastic a and b stretched more in the second trial. ^p b. The student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, they should acknowledge the amount of weight should be the same length. Another way would be to write down the initial length of the plastic was the smallest. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5.
8808	2	0	0	Stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table. 
8809	2	0	0	I can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is because b had stretched to 22 mm on t1, and 23 mm on t2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type a and c ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and plastic type a had streched the least. B). He could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way the students can improve the results by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time. 
8810	2	0	0	As it was not mentioned. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results. Also the students should run more trials to make it more accurate results. 
8811	2	0	0	Included time and more trials. 
8812	2	0	0	Will determine how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. ^p (2) use a different conteince. 
8813	2	0	0	 these results are not valid. In order to make an easier comparison. 
8814	2	0	0	They said how much weights was on the plastics. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how much weight each can hold. 
8815	2	0	0	Type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. B. ) two ways of improving; ^p 1)used a different weight for second trial. The students could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table. 
8816	2	0	0	By starting off with each polymer with the same length. Also, the student could have improved the experiment is to specify in how many weights they used. Also they could've have much weight they were using in step #4."
8817	2	0	0	Made sure each sample of plastic. 
8818	2	0	0	Pressure and to add a control with all plastic types with the same weight for each trial and plastic type b only stretched 20mm. 
8819	2	0	0	Specified the weight being used. 
8820	2	0	0	Plastic sit for a min. 
8821	2	0	0	Explained how much do the weights weighed. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results. 
8822	2	0	0	Only strech 20 mm. Type c is almost the same firmness as a, and d all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm. ^p b. More trials and use more plastic types. 
8823	2	0	0	Length in the graph to help show that they did strecth. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changed the results. 
8824	2	0	0	 so the only affected ones were plastic type a, b,c and d had different results. He got a-b lower higher and c-d higher lower. ^p two ways the students could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and that the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have also tell how many weights to add to the plastics, 2. He could've specified the names of the plastics, and never change it. 
8825	2	0	0	The experiment more conclusive. 
8826	2	0	0	See how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
8827	2	0	0	Making his hypothesis clearer. He also could have done more trials. "
8828	2	0	0	Trial let it beng longer. 
8829	2	0	0	Of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first trial. Also to use different plastics to see how much long the plastic could stretch before breaking. 
8830	2	0	0	Stretchability because both trials it stretched the most in t1 and t2. This experiment could be improved by adding a controlled, and by listing different polymers they were using. Secondly, to make it more valid. 
8831	2	0	0	And b strech the most. 2 ways the students could have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic. ^p 2. A way to improve the experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weights. 
8832	2	0	0	Can improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results. 
8833	2	0	0	Trial a and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type to see it there was much difference. The students could have improved this expirement is to make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm. ^p (b)the experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials. 
8834	2	0	0	A was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most durring the 5 minutes. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same length. 
8835	2	0	0	23mm the second trial. ^p the student could have improved the experimental design is repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples'', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure. "
8836	2	0	0	Depending on the type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible, stretchable or most likely thinnest of all four plastic types. The student could have improved the validity by making sure all the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be that the best plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment. 
8837	2	0	0	That was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type a because its number in t1(10) was and t2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut each plastic to the same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area. 
8838	2	0	0	Higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. 
8839	2	0	0	Student could have possibly added more weight to each plastic. Finally, they need a control with no weights on it. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i. E. 100 grams ). 
8840	2	0	0	Have taken measurements as the 5 minutes were passing. Multiple trials would have also helped prove the validity of this experiment is type b stretched the most for both trials, them plastic type c stretched more than plastic type a which in t1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic type d was the same in length and width. By doing this it will make sure that the amount of stretched of t1 and t2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights. 
8841	2	0	0	And did one to two more trails. 
8842	2	0	0	Student could improve by recordin the amount of weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results. 
8843	2	0	0	On it than the others. Plastic b stretched the most, d second most, c third, and a was the least stretchy. I do not, however, as the results are consistent between trials, the lengths should be averaged. There also should have been a percise number of weights added. 
8844	2	0	0	Stretch would be plastic a because in t1 only stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm. Type c had a decrease of one in the trials and d showed no signs of change. Plastic a and c were less stretchable than type b by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is b, d, c then a, where a is the stretchiest. ^p b) they could have included how much weights was added during the experiment. Another way to improve the experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to show the accuracy of the results. Also the students should have made the procedure less. 
8845	2	0	0	More trials for the samples of plastic. Another way that they could improve the design is to say how much weight they added the the clamps. 
8846	2	0	0	Student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm). ^p b) the student should of listed the length of the plastics when the student first started. 
8847	2	0	0	Or validity is by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight on each and by saying the names. 
8848	2	0	0	Not say they are all held at the same height. It does not say they are all held at the same height in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type. ^p b) to improve there experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work. 
8849	2	0	0	And is more resiliant. ^p b) two ways students could of  improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. 
8850	2	0	0	Investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic d came out even in the second trail it stretched 23 mm. The students also could have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial. 
8851	2	0	0	Table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible, stretchable or most likely thinnest of all four plastic types. The student could've listed the diffrent types  of plastics used and explain the procedure better. 
8852	2	0	0	Higest strech in meters. ^p b 1.) make sure the plastics are all the same beginning length. A way that this experiment could be improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of them are the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer. 
8853	2	0	0	The plastic being stretched. 
8854	2	0	0	Was most stretchable and a was the worst. ^p b. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type b of 20mm. ^p b. Two ways that these students can improve their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut each plastic to the same length and width, and second they could have drawn a graph to show their results in a clearer way. "
8855	2	0	0	The number of trials. 
8856	2	0	0	Pieces are the same size and use the same amount of weight pulling on it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics. 
8857	2	0	0	Added through out the experiments the same. With plastic c, plastic c, the a. ^p (b)this student could made this lab better is that all the plastic samples the student could make sure each test was in same environment. 
8858	2	0	0	The most flexable while plastic a was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like b, plastic d stretched more than all other plastic types. In both trials plastic d did not stretch at all. ^p (b) the students could improve this experiment by specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment. 
8859	2	0	0	Least one or two mm from its original length yet type c shrink and type d remained the same. A second way would be to write down the mm it started at and another way is to say exactly how much weight was added. 
8860	2	0	0	One type stood the same. 
8861	2	0	0	Conclude that plastic c is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. That student could of done more trials of each plastic type and trial tested. 
8862	2	0	0	Add another trial so that the results would have been more valid as if the weights on the clamp. 
8863	2	0	0	Least and was able to stretch the farthest (t1:22mm, t2:23mm) and plastic a stretched the least. One way the student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they were adding to the clamp. Another way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastics sample, since the size is in the final measurement, this could alter the results by a lot. 
8864	2	0	0	Is serving as another weight. 
8865	2	0	0	To receive the most accurate answer, and they also could have added on more weight over a period of time. 
8866	2	0	0	Different from t2 data. 
8867	2	0	0	The plastic types and how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic. 
8868	2	0	0	For both trials one and two. They could have told the plastic pieces original length. Those are two ways the students could have improved the experiment by using a constant length for all u. 
8869	2	0	0	Least in both trials. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. 
8870	2	0	0	Only had two trials instead of three. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the lab to know the task at hand. 
8871	2	0	0	Recreate the experiment and compare notes. 
8872	2	0	0	And d stretched out of all of the plastics were the same length to ensure validity. 
8873	2	0	0	 they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched. 
8874	2	0	0	Add weights to the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes to see how much it actually stretched. 
8875	2	0	0	 this compares to plastic a, b, c or d. ^p b) two differnt ways the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off. 
8876	2	0	0	Us what plastic to use. For example in step 2, the could of said how much weight should be attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results. Another way to improve the experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could have explained more how to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length would improve the validity, the student should say how long each type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, she should tell what plastics were used. 
8877	2	0	0	Plastic sample all the same length. ^p b. To improve this experiment is to perform more than 2 trials. 
8878	2	0	0	On some of their steps. 
8879	2	0	0	And recording the time it took  to stretch. 
8880	2	0	0	On to the plastic. They should have done twice trial to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error. 
8881	2	0	0	Your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. 
8882	2	0	0	Organized and not well thought - out. ^p b)these student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was by giving the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic. Also, i can see that plastic a is the most provable because it stretched the most in this investigation. It held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the experiment the plastic was strech at least 1mor millameter greater in the second trial, plastic a was  the least flexible. The first thing the student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy. 
8883	2	0	0	Specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same spot in trial 1 and 12mm in trial two. Plastic type a did not stretch as much in trial 2 (t2) as they did in trial 1 (t1). ^p the student could have set an exact length for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand, was the least stretchable, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type d's 20mm, type c's 13.5mm and type a's 11mm. ^p b) two ways the students could have said how much weight to add. 
8884	2	0	0	Way the results could have simply been improved with a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes. 
8885	2	0	0	Written the measurements of the plastic before it  was stretched. 
8886	2	0	0	In the same places. Another step would be to make sure all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic. 
8887	2	0	0	Likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p one way the students could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. One place was more affected. ^p (b)one way to improve their experiment the student could have had the plastic types start at the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table. 
8888	2	0	0	All that were tested. ^p b she could have included a specific weight to use and they could have preformed more trials. 
8889	2	0	0	Least a milimeter per trial. Two ways that the students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight and adding a control. 
8890	2	0	0	Designs was by adding more trials and more valiability. The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break. 
8891	2	0	0	 except for plastic type c that decreased. I also noticed that the most stretchable plastic was plastic type a. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at. 
8892	2	0	0	And d stayed at 20. The plastic type b stretched out the longest. 
8893	2	0	0	Besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say this because plastic b had stretched more than plastic type a which was at 10 for t1 and 12 for t2. Type b stretched to 22 mm while plastic d only stretched to 20mm and c to 14mm. In trial a it reached 10mm and in trial b it reached to 12mm. Two ways they could have improved the experiment would be to increase the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. Also, they should have more trials than just 2. ^p they also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, control. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, it is actually impossible to see which one of these bags are more durable than the rest of the plastic types. He could have measured
8894	2	0	0	But not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second polymer had the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, which was the smallest length. Plastic type a is the stretchrest. B) they could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on each clamp so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more accurate depending on the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another thing they could of done more trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because that was not stated in the procedure. The length of the cup before the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment. 
8895	2	0	0	Make a more valid point. ^p a-10, 12. ^p b-22, 23. ^p c-14, 13. ^p d-20, 20.
8896	2	0	0	By leaving the the clamps on the plastic and how much weight should be added. Another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
8897	2	0	0	12 mm stretched in the two trials. ^p b- include sofleg make is and start with the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial. 
8898	2	0	0	Rule out length as a variable. 
8899	2	0	0	Plastic b both trials had the most millimeters for plastic stretched. Two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. The control in this experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (t3) to realy test it because if it was different in (t1), and (t2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer. 
8900	2	0	0	Get a wider range of data, and by cutting all the plastic samples were the same size. This way average will be more precise. 
8901	2	0	0	And say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched. 
8902	2	0	0	The exact weight of the weights. 
8903	2	0	0	Descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes. 
8904	2	0	0	Have specified and exact number or weights added to the plastics and for t2 i believe that a different amount of weight. Second he should or had same type of measure ment on how long the bags where befor he did the experiment, on the other hand plastic type a had the least amount of stretching. 
8905	2	0	0	Step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate. 
8906	2	0	0	 their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length. 
8907	2	0	0	Streched 1mm and d stayed the same. One way the student could change the procedure, and perform a second trial (t2) exactly like the first trial. One way the student could improve was to add different weights. 2. The student should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight, they were adding to the clamp. 
8908	2	0	0	B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. ^p b) two ways the students could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (t3) for the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, plastic type b stretched the most. Also, he could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment more conclusive. 
8909	2	0	0	Wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached. 
8910	2	0	0	Similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials to test its validity and the other would be to identify a set mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials because they only held two. 
8911	2	0	0	The students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table. 
8912	2	0	0	 poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic. ^p b) the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment. 
8913	2	0	0	T2 in the plastic b in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial c the trial, the results seem valid. 
8914	2	0	0	Could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight  added and give specific starting length for each plastic, instead of measuring different lengths to start with. 
8915	2	0	0	Having all of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic you tape down. 
8916	2	0	0	Must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two. Type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type b stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest of the four types. I concluded that plastic type b has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
8917	2	0	0	Length for every plastic. 
8918	2	0	0	Another way to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured after a longer amount of time. 
8919	2	0	0	Like each plastics length or width, in order to improve experimental design or validity of the results is did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could have also said what type of plastics are being stretched. Second, the student could have improved their experiment design is to specify how heavy the weights are. "
8920	2	0	0	The bottom at the same time. One place was more affected. ^p (b)one way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Also for better validity of their data they could've put how the plastic measured before and after instead of already skipping to the math part. 
8921	2	0	0	Hold on to the clip. 
8922	2	0	0	Experiment the which plastic is the most discrible. 
8923	2	0	0	Out the plastics so you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment. 
8924	2	0	0	Sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime. 
8925	2	0	0	Are not very stretchy. ^p b) one way to improve the experimentol design would be to identify a set mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, they should had left more minutes to hang. 
8926	2	0	0	Because they all increase other than one (plastic type). It is also important to specify the amount of weight added. Also, could've added more weights. ^p waited more times. 
8927	2	0	0	Used the same amount of each plastic. 
8928	2	0	0	That the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. The second way the studentce could have improved the validity is to get wide range of the different types. 
8929	2	0	0	Good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes. 
8930	2	0	0	Plastic type b that stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p b. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to get more valid results. 
8931	2	0	0	Stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment. 
8932	2	0	0	Have checked the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, and the weights are the same weight. ^p b) the student could have made this expiriment better by making sure the amount of weights you add one. 
8933	2	0	0	His procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly. 
8934	2	0	0	The results you can tell that plastic type b had stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm. The student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, things go along more smoothly. 
8935	2	0	0	Experiment for plastics b, c, and d. The student should haw used the same length of 20mm for both trials. Also i think he should have chase two different plastics to see different results. 
8936	2	0	0	Attached so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights. 
8937	2	0	0	With the least stretch would be plastic a because it was stretched 2mm while b and c were the least. ^p the student would have improved is by increasing the amount of trials. ^p the student could have improved this experiment. 
8938	2	0	0	The results are 20 mm for t1 and 13 mm for t2. Lastly for plastic d the results are 20 mm for t1 and 23 for t2. Plastic c the results are 14 mm for t1 and 23 for t2. Plastic c the results are 14 mm for t1 and 12 mm for t2. For plastic b the results are 22 mm for t1 and 20 mm for t2. That's what a students conclusion would look like. 
8939	2	0	0	Stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic type a had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics. ^p b) two ways the student could improve is by making sure all the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer. 
8940	2	0	0	Could have put more weights on the plastic. 
8941	2	0	0	The two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. The student could have stated what the types of plastic. ^p b. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weights that were used. ^p the student could have make a third trial to make results more valid. 
8942	2	0	0	Student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same lengths and could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial. 
8943	2	0	0	And validity of them is by stating how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student should have specified how much weight they used, just to make sure that the temperature of the room i was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at first or how much weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p (b) run more trials to make it more reliable would be to make the experiment more valid. 
8944	2	0	0	To see a better average because some of them were close. 
8945	2	0	0	Make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type d stretches the second most, c the third, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial. The students experiment was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time i would recommend trying different weights to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics. 
8946	2	0	0	Emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of weights. 
8947	2	0	0	Of weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of this experiment could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different way to show the data. Plastic type b stretched the most. ^p b. One way that the student could have made all the plastics the same length. 
8948	2	0	0	To the clamps and the types of plastics and add more trials. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid. 
8949	2	0	0	Weight is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to there experiment. 
8950	2	0	0	And the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group. 
8951	2	0	0	Plastics type a stretched the least, and plastic type a had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the second weakest was plastic c. Two way to improve is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length and width before each of them were stretched. They also can use different kinds of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics. Also add heavier weights. 
8952	2	0	0	Help make sure there was no faulty data, such as b and d, are much more stretchable than polymers such as a and c so therefore, b and c were the most alike and types b and d stretched more. Both trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer. Another way he could of improved this experiment is by testing a third trial. 
8953	2	0	0	The weights were all equal in each group. 
8954	2	0	0	Of weight added should be included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamps, and add weight to the clamp. 
8955	2	0	0	More trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastic, also they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added how many times they did it and record how long they did it for. 
8956	2	0	0	Type because the strogest  because it was the one that stretched the most in t1 and t2. This experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer. 
8957	2	0	0	 and include the length from floor to table. 
8958	2	0	0	They had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer. 
8959	2	0	0	Plastic b which results were 22mm in t1 and 12mm in t2. The least stretchy would be plastic type b. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p b) one way the student could have improved would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways. 
8960	2	0	0	Said that plastic a is the least strechable. After five minutes in trial 1 it stretched 22mm, while in trial two it stretched 23mm while type a stretched 12mm. Type b stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way the students could improve this experiment by adding a third trial for each plastic: and two, which was 20(mm). ^p (b)two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of time. This means that plastic a tolerated the weight on the clamp. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more interesting. 
8961	2	0	0	Do this experiment than twice. 
8962	2	0	0	Plastic type d streched 20mm both times. Types b and c fall in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable. 
8963	2	0	0	Stretchability with 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second. The student should have stated how much weight to add onto each materials. 
8964	2	0	0	Weights although they could have improved the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic. 
8965	2	0	0	Are the same weight. 
8966	2	0	0	His results could have been improved was the amount of weight needed to be used. 
8967	2	0	0	Could improve the validity of the experiment would be to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics. 
8968	2	0	0	They might get better results. 
8969	2	0	0	The starting length for each plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second they could have performed another trial for each plastic to be valid. 
8970	2	0	0	Including a control of each. 
8971	2	0	0	Than just results more valid. 
8972	2	0	0	By adding materials and also doing the experiment again. 
8973	2	0	0	Said to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length. 
8974	2	0	0	How they react under more weight pressure. 
8975	2	0	0	Should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes. "
8976	2	0	0	It actually got smaller by 1mm. Type c is almost the same firmness as a, and d all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial. Also i would've done one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the results of the experiment you can conclude that plastic type d was the most and stayed the same tril 1 and tril 2.^p (b)he should of done another tril to make sure if he got different/ same results. 
8977	2	0	0	Was the most accurate, plastic b stretch 1mm, plastic c, the amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three. ^p state what length you're excepting to keep them the same. 
8978	2	0	0	Experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see a better average because some of them were close. 
8979	2	0	0	Tested exactly what type of plastic to use so the experiment is more valid. 
8980	2	0	0	 if you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic b was 22 and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. Also type d was the one that stretched the farthest. The student should have been more specific in their procedure. Also to measure how much of the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error. 
8981	2	0	0	Could have more of a comparison between each trial. ^p b) the student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment. 
8982	2	0	0	In t2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should see how much weight it can hold. Another way the experimental design could have been improved, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled. 
8983	2	0	0	Much it dents the plastic, since stretchability is being tested. 
8984	2	0	0	If all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and the least durable. B) the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times. 
8985	2	0	0	Lab in two ways. First off the students have to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant, as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched. A second way is to include more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched. 
8986	2	0	0	When they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is because, on average, it stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type a was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for t2 and 12mm for t2. ^p (b) one way the student could have used the same amount of the weights used. 
8987	2	0	0	Experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastic. 
8988	2	0	0	Differently depending on how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out. 
8989	2	0	0	The others were far behind it. Two ways they could have made sure each plastic was the same length in the beginning and the second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one. 
8990	2	0	0	And saying hope much weight is put on to the clamps. 
8991	2	0	0	Where to tape it the student could also make each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also could have used the same length to begin with. The student could have improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could have done more trials. 
8992	2	0	0	By listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use. 
8993	2	0	0	Out both of the trials. The student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed. 
8994	2	0	0	Conclude plastic type b stretched 22mm while plastic c only stretched 14mm. Type a stretched the least. ^p b) all the plastics should have been the same length to start with. Another way they could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results. Another way that this experiment could be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to put on the clamps. 
8995	2	0	0	The weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say plastic b stretched the most. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as adding even more trials. Another thing they could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much. 
8996	2	0	0	Was the farthest stretched. One way the student could have improved the experimental design! Validity of the results, the plastic b is the most  stretchable type of plastic because according to the data collected, plastic type b had the most stretchability followed by type a. Type c and d are in the midle. ^p b) 1) could have said how much weight the stretch could withstand. 
8997	2	0	0	D is not good for the investigation. 
8998	2	0	0	It is best to do a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment. 
8999	2	0	0	Stretchability the first try has. ^p b) the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Also could more infomation, and the height that the plastic hung from.
