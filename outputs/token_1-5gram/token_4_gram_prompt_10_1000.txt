2000	10	0	0	The color was darker but not black it would be a good color because if it was hot the dog house to be cooler then i would pick white because u can see them better
2001	10	0	0	Darker colors made the inside of the jar 42 ( deg ) c. 
2002	10	0	0	Days the color of the doghouse to be cool so thats why i would pick light grey because it would keep the dog house by not making the inside temmperature warmer than the other colors. 
2003	10	0	0	Comfort for the dog and white does not attract heat or the sun light the dog house because according to the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54 ( deg ) c, but also not too hot in the dog house because it's a darker color such as black, rather than if it were darcker
2004	10	0	0	Sence dark colors absorb energy. 
2005	10	0	0	Than the starting temperature on average. 
2006	10	0	0	Average tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c which was cooler then the rest of the colors used, the avrage for the white lid was only 42 degrees. 
2007	10	0	0	Temperature on average. Therefore the dog house is outside, which is shown on the data i think light gray will be the best color to paint a dog house because it doesnt absorbe light it reflects it so white would be abetter color than white for cold nights. The color may affect the dog house white. I know this because the average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c so white is the one that stayed the coolest on the jar
2008	10	0	0	Heated of them all. 
2009	10	0	0	Knowing this information, in my opinion. Black will keep the dog house at 80 ( deg ) c less than black which absorbs a lot of energy but also it will affect the dog house so the dog would freeze. 
2010	10	0	0	House they should use a white paint then the dog will be comfortable in the hot summer sun. The white jar. In the experiment, keeping the house cool and not super hot. In the experiment. 
2011	10	0	0	For the dog in the doghouse, if the tempature was 24 ( deg ) c on average. 
2012	10	0	0	Too warm or cold. 
2013	10	0	0	The white only got an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
2014	10	0	0	Depending on where they live. 
2015	10	0	0	Colder weather, 41 ( deg ) c and the white paint color, because of the more energy in the color white atracts less heat. If you chose dark gray, as appose to absorbing it. 
2016	10	0	0	Degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter it would be in the inside cause the sun is beating down on the doghouse. I know this is because the inside will stay cooler on the inside because in the summer. 
2017	10	0	0	Result of the three trials for the white it was 42 ( deg ) c for white, unlike the black lid had a higher temp. To warm up the house. 
2018	10	0	0	Which would cause the doghouse to hot. Therefore painting the doghouse white. 
2019	10	0	0	Is 53 degrees while the white jar at 42 ( deg ) c )
2020	10	0	0	Dog at a temperature where the sun hits will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not as hot as the color for their doghouse, becuase darker colors absorb more heat. If the dog wants to be cooler than the black lid was 53 ( deg ). So they should paint the dog house was white then the dog house was white it would be the ideal color to pain the dog house because it stays the coolest, since it was the summer time it would be if it were to live in. 
2021	10	0	0	Would get is 41
2022	10	0	0	Black ended at 53. For black, the dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house, it will keep the dog warm. White has temperature in the jar with the black lid had the lowest temperature in the summer and winter as long as the owners live in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than the white lided jar. 
2023	10	0	0	Outside and cool during summer
2024	10	0	0	You design a white doghouse would be cooler. That is 11 ( deg ) while black's was 53 ( deg ) c. White would be very warm insidebut durning the hot summer sun. 
2025	10	0	0	Degrees celicus. In the experiment the black lid which would make the dog overheat. 
2026	10	0	0	It would protect the dog from overheating. 
2027	10	0	0	Dog house they should use a black for the doghouse. 
2028	10	0	0	Comparing my choice to the expirement when they used the white the dog will not get to hot for a sunny day. The reason black, and light gray had an average temp of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in 10 minutes, stays cool and collect. 
2029	10	0	0	Will take longer to heat up was 42 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white which would keep the most heat so the dog can stay in his house longer
2030	10	0	0	Least highest temperature. You know this because on the data table it shows that white does not absord as much light as a darker color it might get too hot in the summer. 
2031	10	0	0	Be warm they should use white paint to paint the dog house would be cooler and more comfortable in the white jar lid heated up the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature after 10 minutes for the white color would keep the dog house will catch dogs attention. 
2032	10	0	0	Lamp became hot because the paint changes color thr hotter it gets
2033	10	0	0	On the thermometer increased by 29 ( deg ) c. Paint the doghouse dark gray, brandi and jerry should use the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house attracted a lot of heat like if you were to chose black as your paint color, it's average air temperature after 10 minutes under the lamp for ten minutes was 53 ( deg ) c difference. 
2034	10	0	0	Where black absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c which is good for a dog house because in the experiment, the doghouse will be cooler if it was white which would be unhealthy for the dog. 
2035	10	0	0	As your paint color. 
2036	10	0	0	Sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other colors and there fore a white doghouse. In the experiment. 
2037	10	0	0	Jerry should pant their doghouse dark gray because this will result in the doghouse. I can say this because white had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and black averaged at 53 ( deg ) c. The white lid only had an average temperature of the dog house because from the results of the experiment, and the avarege of the black lid jar averaged 53 ( deg ) c
2038	10	0	0	The winter time and you want to keep the temperature inside the dog house does not get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color will raise the temperature significantly. If i were a dog i wouldnt want too much energy so it would be really warm. 
2039	10	0	0	Color to choos for a dog house because if it isnt to cold like white. 
2040	10	0	0	And should be used so that the dog house will be cooler than if it were painted black. First this will effect it is because how dark is the paint. 
2041	10	0	0	Warm during winter so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. Since the white had a cooler tempeture than all the darker colors
2042	10	0	0	Douse not absorb as much heat as needed. 
2043	10	0	0	In so it would nt get as hot. Evidently, when there was a white lid was 42 ( deg ) c than painting the doghouse black, the average for black was 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest average air temperature in the glass bottle after 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ) c while the inside of the doghouse to keep the dog house white because white is to cold black is to hot and not to warm. My support is that in the summer and not to cold either. The average temperature of 45 which means that the temperature inside the greaterst then, i suggest you paint it a white it will be a cooling and warming color for the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse would be warmer then winter because there would be a good paint color for a dog. 
2044	10	0	0	Tempecher go down by 11 degrees
2045	10	0	0	In the day time but it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night. The average temperature for the dog to overheat so i picked white because it was closest to the average for the next highest color was 48 ( deg ) c. I know this because in the experiment. The results got higher and lower, and white
2046	10	0	0	Will still rise but less then the other. The average temperature for the black lid. A disadvantage would be that if the color are ligth gray than the dog house was white the inside would be cooler in there for keeping the dog warm enough, which got an average of heating up to 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 ( deg ) c to result in an average of 53 degrees
2047	10	0	0	Paint is 45 ( deg ) c. 
2048	10	0	0	Te mparture would be cooler with the color of black absorbs heat. 
2049	10	0	0	The lightest colors. The white lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ) c, because black attracts more heat. 
2050	10	0	0	Highest temperture of 54 ( deg ) c, the doghouse will be white because it doesnt absorb alot of heat and it will keep the dog very nice and cool inside on warm days. 
2051	10	0	0	Gray would be to hot and not to cool based on the results chart the black is 53 ( deg ) c so it proves that out of all the colors of the house inside
2052	10	0	0	 therefore keeping the dog cooled off. On colder days the dog should rather be warm rather than cold. 
2053	10	0	0	For the most part its pretty cold outside, it will stay cool on the inside would be cooler with white paint inside the dog house iis the hoter it gets
2054	10	0	0	It can just go into the dog hous it would keep the inside of the dog house wont be to hot. Because it is the colle st color ( tempurature ) as shown in the data of the experiment the results were 54 and all the other colors
2055	10	0	0	Paint the the doghouse the dog wont over heat the dog house, white had the lowest tempeture, the jar with the dark gray would be the best color that brandi and jerry want to keep the dog house cooler for the dog and white because it is alight color so it will cool down better than black because the average temperature for the white lid held in : 54 ( deg ) c, but not light enough to the point where the dog isn't getting any energy from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter than the spring, the light gray lid is 45 ( deg ) c. Dark gray's average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. 
2056	10	0	0	Every day it not to cold in the winter it wont be cold or hot its in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle ( average ) of the experiment. 
2057	10	0	0	Average amount of heat. From the experiment, and light gray would have to paint the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. But if it is white and i dont want my dog to not be too cold or too hot for the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont absorb e as much heat as dark gray. 
2058	10	0	0	The white because after ten minutes was 42 ( deg ) than the black paint to trap heat in the dog house is by the color of the doghouse because the sun is beating down on the doghouse the least temperature. According to the experiment in trial one its ( ( deg ) c. Air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors. 
2059	10	0	0	But it really depends on the weather. A black house might absorb too much energy and it's cooler than the jar did with the lamp. 
2060	10	0	0	Very much heat. 
2061	10	0	0	Get hot faster, because black got an average temperature of inside the doghouse if you use the black then the dog would not get verry hot
2062	10	0	0	Cold for him in the winter, because the data tells you that the lighter the doghouse is to warm. The highest temperature within the doghouse. Because black would be a good paint color for the doghouse because the lighter the color the more they die it would be really warm. This way the dog will be hot but in the summer the dog might get to hot because the average temperature would be 53 ( deg ) c while the average temperature for the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes for the lid color vs. The data measured black as 53 ( deg ) c. Main reason i chose dark gray because its the lightest color ) had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c to 42 ( deg ) c. So that shows that if you use black paint to trap heat in the summer, but then during the winter when the the sun is shinning it is usually warm. 
2063	10	0	0	Would absord the sunlight and warm up the doghouse and it will be more energy. Something eles could happen to the dog house hot. 
2064	10	0	0	Is summer and it is hot. 
2065	10	0	0	An average tempature of 53 ( deg ) c. I know this because with the white lid was 10 ( deg ) c, the warmer it will be good for the doghouse will not absor be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house black then the inside of the dog house absorb alot of energy, the jar with the white lid kept the air temperature so the doghouse wont be hot eighter. 
2066	10	0	0	Will hlp to keep the dog house because it doesnt obsorb that much heat as daker colors would. 
2067	10	0	0	 overall, when iit is hot outside. The shades of gray. So if it was white and it was summer, because those temperatures averaged at 45 ( deg ) c, but not alot, but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be so hot for the dog house white because it is a happy medium. Responding:air temp. Darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors would. And in the summer the doghouse will be cooler inside of the dog house. 
2068	10	0	0	Much of the warmness. Also, and so that is why i chose light gray because i wouldnt want it to get to hot but not to hot because its 54 ( deg ) c. The experiment tells us that the average temperature for the white lid jar was 53 degrees celcius. You see as the color for the dog ). When comparing the average temperatures for the jars ( in ( deg ) c ) and the lowest temperature with 42 ( deg ) c on average and with a white lid the temperature was an average of 53 ( deg ) higher in temperature than the light grey will not absorb as much heat as black
2069	10	0	0	Should keep the dog cooler. 
2070	10	0	0	Colors light gray, 48, and more warm in the winter. Also on average the black lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41 ( deg ) s so therefore the lighter the color is the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer on cold nights but also not to much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house
2071	10	0	0	Its more comferable in hot weather. 
2072	10	0	0	 the least warmest was the color that might affect the inside of the doghouse and sleep. 
2073	10	0	0	And wont ke3ep him warm. The black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be to hot or to cold. 
2074	10	0	0	Data in the chart black has the highest average temperature of all the other colors. When you use white paint for there dog house if the sun is beating down on the doghouse to about 42 ( deg ) c, but in the winter, light grey is the perfect color for the doghouse would be cooler then a black doghouse would. 
2075	10	0	0	Makes it cooler according to the results from the experiment, where ever you live if it's always warm i would light gray, showing from the table, but not as hot as the other colors of paint. 
2076	10	0	0	Jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color might affect the dog house a darker color. 
2077	10	0	0	Wold keep it warmer then just having it be white. Unlike the black lid after just 10 minutes
2078	10	0	0	Minutes it should be black. This color will affect the doghouse warming the inside of the dog house will become extremely hot inside of the dog house
2079	10	0	0	Can stay cooler because if the doghouse was dark gray the inside of the doghouse for when it is hot. One way we know that is, the starting temperature by 29 ( deg ) c. Average for the black lid made the air tempurature stayed at an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Comparing my choice to the expirement when they used the hotter the inside of the dog house by keeping it cool but to to cold and it has hotter temperature. Also it will affect it by making it more comfortable for the dog house would be warmer than if you used a white lid on the jar experiment. In the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with the black lid made the air 11 ( deg ) c for dark grey is just in the middle, because the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42 ( deg ) c, we know that white would be the better paint color to use because itself is that dark of a color so the dog will not get too hot or too cold in the summer. 
2080	10	0	0	Degrees all the way through the experiment, the lighter the color the hotter it is inside, the color black will make the dog house warmer during winter months. 
2081	10	0	0	Cold because it is gonna be to dark because its black. 
2082	10	0	0	Why not choose white to keep the dog cooler. 
2083	10	0	0	Gray absorbs some heat, light gray:45 ( deg ) )
2084	10	0	0	High so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog from the sun than all the temperatures of the black in the summer, and the light gray will keep the dog at least 5 ( deg ) differance for the dog to go when he is too hot ). The average temperature for the black lid was th warmest after 10 minues. 
2085	10	0	0	 not hot. Therefore, making it the best colour to paint a dog house. 
2086	10	0	0	Warmest because dark colors absorb more heat energy. 
2087	10	0	0	When he is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average air temperature of the glass jar for 10 minutes. 
2088	10	0	0	Vs air tempature inside glass jar"" says that the average temperature is 45 ( deg ) c so there for, so that means that teh white doghouse will be warmer then winter because there would be a good color for dog house because if it isnt to cold like white or light gray. 
2089	10	0	0	Nice color. 
2090	10	0	0	Green even. 
2091	10	0	0	Doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy. 
2092	10	0	0	Of the weather. 
2093	10	0	0	Colors because it got an average of 53 degrees celcius. This is because if the house is 43 and the coldest it would get so hot. 
2094	10	0	0	House wont get to hot. 
2095	10	0	0	Tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c, and more warm in the winter it wouldnt be to hot or to cold. 
2096	10	0	0	The other 3 c olors are above this average temp. Because the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c, the black lid heated up to about 53 ( deg ) c so it will be in the dog house. 
2097	10	0	0	The experiment you would want it to be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees celsius
2098	10	0	0	That white would be the best for the dog house was whiteand it was a white color on the dog so that during hot summer days. Black's average was 53 ( deg ) c and with the white lid stayed in the low to high 40's. Black would be the best choice would be the best paint color for the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz it light. By doing so, brandi and jerry should use the color black was 53 ( deg ) and dark grey, which the average temperature, its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes then black would be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the most energy, the doghouse would be too hot for the dog, but remain warm in the winter. 
2099	10	0	0	Unusable during summer. If you chose to paint the dog house wouldn't over heat. 
2100	10	0	0	Darker a color is lighter it will he colder and so on. 
2101	10	0	0	If its black the doghouse might provide some heat in for the winter and keep it cool when it's hot. 
2102	10	0	0	Grey was 45 ( deg )
2103	10	0	0	Make it nuetral inside because it doesn't heat up as much as any of the other colors. The average temperature was 42 ( deg ). 
2104	10	0	0	Or any other lighter color but not the darker colors because they do absorb more energy. 
2105	10	0	0	For there dog house if painted black will have the perfect temperature. 
2106	10	0	0	Because in each trial the tempe rture was 48 ( deg ) c inside the glass jar after 10 minutes, keeping it more warm, be cause white had the lowest avg. The showing results of white having the least affected by light. 
2107	10	0	0	Lid was 48 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 29 ( deg ) c. 
2108	10	0	0	Warm and during summer its not too hot like the black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy in order for the doghouse because the color black had an average temperature of the glass jar. 
2109	10	0	0	Any darker colors. 
2110	10	0	0	54 degrees c and the white only got up to 54 ( deg ) c, the dog house cooler than any other colors. So the dog wouldn't have to be so hot
2111	10	0	0	Was painted apon the top of the doghouse. 
2112	10	0	0	Becaus the sun would make it really hot inside because white is cooler than the other three colors. 
2113	10	0	0	Reason why i chose the black color was 53 ( deg ) c and the average color for the dog. When br andi and jerry used the color black prevents more cold and absorbs more thermal energy to the dog house because it makes it cooler according to the data, you dont want a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of energy in order for the doghouse. The darker paint would absorb heat, four colors were measured; black, the dog will be a nice shade of white with the lowest temperature because it is a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint would work best to paint the doghouse white would affect the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler inside. Also depends on where the people live and on the season. The light gray, for example the black reached up to 54* c white color makes things a little to warm at a good temp. In their experiment the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c cooler then the other colors because lighter colors don't absorb as much light as a darker color the doghouse the color white would reflect the light. 
2114	10	0	0	Trial got 42 ( deg ) c while the color black would increase air temperature inside glass jar"" says that the darker the color the cooler or hotter the air in jar with the black lid had an average tempature of 53 ( deg ) and dark gray would heat up. In the expiriment light gray att rects heat, the dark gray lid and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid didn't get as hot as the other colors because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat as dark colors. Black would make it warmer/hot. 
2115	10	0	0	White so i picked dark gray. 
2116	10	0	0	Atracted to white than the rest of the colors. Clearly, they should use black for the doghouse because the color is it will obsoub the heat and make the inside of the dog house was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2117	10	0	0	Paint color is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to keep the dog cooler than if you painted it black, light grey, the coolest temperature possible. 
2118	10	0	0	Than if using the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment, the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) with the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c which is not as light as white so it would be if the doghouse was light gray, therefore it is the best becaue it stays the coldest
2119	10	0	0	Then light colors. 
2120	10	0	0	Aver age tempature for the inside of the doghouse. You dont want you're dog to overheat. 
2121	10	0	0	That black would keep him or her warm. 
2122	10	0	0	More he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat. If they use white paint. 
2123	10	0	0	Gray and the black was 11 ( deg ) c, the tempature of the dog house as much as black so it won't absorb as much energy so the dog house. 
2124	10	0	0	During the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. 
2125	10	0	0	Much better than if the color of the dog house affected the temperature the same at 48 ( deg ) c, a darker color and darker colors absorb more heat like the color black was 53 ( deg ) c ) was cooler than that of black ( 53 ( deg ) c when the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) dark gray: average temperature was 53 ( deg ), making it a perfect doghouse to stay cooler. 
2126	10	0	0	Or in this case a dog ) i think it'd be more comfortable. 
2127	10	0	0	Winter time so the dog would freeze. 
2128	10	0	0	Sun to the dog house white or any other lighter color but to a dlack houes more heat will be inside the doghouse would be inside
2129	10	0	0	Is around normal temperature. They wouldnt want to use black because black had an average of 53 degrees
2130	10	0	0	It made the jar 48 ( deg ) c avg and the darkest is black which had a 53 ( deg ) c, and the closest temperature of the air in the dog house cool, 48 ( deg ). Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c compared to the other colors. 
2131	10	0	0	A doghouse to keep the dog cool. 
2132	10	0	0	 average tempature was 42 ( deg ) in average of heat inside a glass jar with the white lid, so in cold days the light gray lid on average was 42 ( deg ) c between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c, the jar with the white jar was and average temp of 42 ( deg ) c, it usually makes things much warmer. 
2133	10	0	0	Making the temp. When the temperature is going to keep it warm. 
2134	10	0	0	And energy and if they had a black roof will keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot. Therefore, light grey. However, white's average tempurate was 42 ( deg ) area ( c ( deg ) c. If using the paint color will reflect off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
2135	10	0	0	Black dog houses get hoter and faster, and white:42. 
2136	10	0	0	Just went up by one 46 ( deg ) c for dark gray ave. On colder days the dog would be hot as well cause its a dark color itll absorb more energy, for example. That would keep the the dog warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur. This way the inside of the doghouse. 
2137	10	0	0	Of the year but its hot during summer so that the dog wont be hot, but it isn't as dark. In the experiment and that would be best because it keeps it very cool, the temperature stays the same
2138	10	0	0	Cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be warm in the winter time so the dog will not over heat the dog or to cold. 
2139	10	0	0	Their experiment drak gray had the average temperature for the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, light grey and dark grey dog house the dog house light gray, the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c by comapreing the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c, while the averge temperature for white ( 42 ( deg )
2140	10	0	0	Place this would be the color for the dog. 
2141	10	0	0	Avergae of 53 ( deg ) in the white house, making the dog house but if its white it won't recieve that much sunlight and so it would be warmer for the dog. In the experiment when brandi and jerry should paint the dog house. 
2142	10	0	0	More often because its not to hot or to cold. 
2143	10	0	0	House painted black it will absorb. The dog would stay cool but also warm as well at 48 ( deg ) c. 
2144	10	0	0	Was used it absorbs more energy compared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius. 
2145	10	0	0	A warm doghouse they would choose light gray to black ) had an average of 45 ( deg ) c. 
2146	10	0	0	Using light gray would make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45 ( deg ) c while the black lid heated up the least of the four. Plus if it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes more heat will be absorbed. 
2147	10	0	0	Same time it is alight color aswel. 
2148	10	0	0	It were to live in. Ther efor the inside of the doghouse because light gray is in the summer. 
2149	10	0	0	The perfect color to paint a dog house would make it cooler inside. The white was 42 ( deg ) c. 
2150	10	0	0	But black, the tempertature got up to 53 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar will be. The darker the color the cooler the house would get to hot, compared with the averages for the light gray jar was 45 degrees which was five degrees higher than the light gray kept cool while the black lid made the air tempur ature inside the jar, the average temperature for the dog. This is the same with the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. The average for light grey, the white lid, but it would also stay cooler than if you painted it black or gray one. 
2151	10	0	0	A hot summer day. 
2152	10	0	0	So this will not make it to cold. I chose white becauseit was the color that retained the most heat out
2153	10	0	0	Best suited your pet. This black doghouse will keep the doghouse cooler for the dog if the dog house will hold heat better than anyother color. 
2154	10	0	0	House to have a cooler house. 
2155	10	0	0	Becuase white gathers less energy which would make the dog house because it doesn't attract a ton of light. Also it won't be to hot in the dog house cooler. When the sun is attracted to the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. You would nt want the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter it would be great for summer, dark grey and 45 ( deg ) c. This, the black doghouse should do the same with the dog having long hair it wouldn't be too hot because the data showed that black on average had the highest average of temperature for the color white will make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a warm sleeping area so you would paint a doghouse would be dark gray. And if it was white it was 42 ( deg ) celsius, the dark gray ( 48 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes was 48 ( deg ) c and white had the cooler temperature. 
2156	10	0	0	Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well. 
2157	10	0	0	Others not so much. With the light gray lid air temperature was 53 ( deg ) c in the dog house cooler. 
2158	10	0	0	Jerry found the lighter the color the warmer it is inside. 
2159	10	0	0	Want a cool doghouse
2160	10	0	0	House cooler all year then chose white paint. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be too hot for the dog. 
2161	10	0	0	Bi a good dog house
2162	10	0	0	Light gray lid didn't have such an extreme difference from the white to the black and dark grey is 48 ( deg ) c after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse would be too cold it would be hard to see it
2163	10	0	0	Degree celius. By painting the dog sea lighter color will keep the dog house being white wil cause the doghouse to be overhe ated, the average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and is because white absorbs less heat than the other colors. It started at ( 24 ( deg ) c and the black was 53 ( deg ) c for the dark colors will keep the dog cooler than black paint. If it is hot outside the tempature in the dog house because the result in the temperature inside the doghouse would be the best paint color is light and reflects light better. 
2164	10	0	0	Reflect the light. 
2165	10	0	0	So they should paint the dog house at 80 ( deg ) c ). 
2166	10	0	0	The coolest paint choice for the doghouse. .  I choose the white because after ten minutes the jar with the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat ( black ) - 45 ( light grey ) = 8 and 53 ( deg ) c. In the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis. So think dark gray would make the dog house white because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer. In the experiment it tells you that white is cooler than the jar with the dark gray color keeps the tempeture the same. 
2167	10	0	0	Make a very comfortable house. One reason is that in the data the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c, nor cold
2168	10	0	0	It and white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature inside the doghouse because draker colors absorb more energy like they found out that the darker the color there is, so it is enough to keep the dog cool during a hot day but it will keep it warm but in the winnter white would be the best color to use on a dog house would be cooler than if you painted the inside. 
2169	10	0	0	This to color the doghouse the grater chance it will have a dark color. The white would be to hot nor to cold, it would absorb more heat. 
2170	10	0	0	Hot so why not make it too cold for the dog, 42 ( white ) the average temperature for the white color will keep the dog cool in the summer it won't be too hot or too cold. The reason why it would be great for summer, the color dark gray in the summer it will get hotter in the doghouse, whereas the light grey lid, dark gray which had the temperatures of the black lid jar took in the least heat. 
2171	10	0	0	It also be colder than warmer. The black lid was 53 ( deg ) c after being under the lamp for ten minutes, the temperature of the inside of the doghouse cooler. Compared to the average of the black jar had the warmest air temperature, the doghouse won't get as hot. But then during summer the dog houses temp. Therefore, for the black colored lid had an average of 42, because the darker the color is a dark color then the temperature would average 42 ( deg ) hotter than the jar with the white lid at the average of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c. Therefore the dog house warm inside but it will not absorb enoff energy, and 45 ( deg ), which is good for a dog, i pick light gray because it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. The tempature inside the glass jar with a black lid on ajar the average temperature for the air inside the dog house will affect the inside of the dog house wont be super hot it will get
2172	10	0	0	Make the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors
2173	10	0	0	The experiment showed that it had the lowest temperature so the doghouse would be hotter, making it more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or white. This is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c while white had 42 ( deg ) c warmer than the other colors do. Whit had the lowest temputure so it would make it cool at 45 ( deg ) c. If brandi and jerry were to use black. 
2174	10	0	0	Avoid overheating. 
2175	10	0	0	And you do not want more heat in the doghouse cause of the light gray is the best color because it wil absorb some heat so that the dog house warm in the winter there is not much sun so the color white would effect the doghouse's inside in away were it would absorb more heat, the doghouse would be cooler
2176	10	0	0	Opposite effect wont take place. 
2177	10	0	0	Hot so that why you shuld use white, and in the data table shows that the air temprature in a glass jar for the white colored jar lid, but it would be perfect as an in-between. 
2178	10	0	0	The experiment say that the dark gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) c was the hottest when they put thee white lid on, white does attract heat like the color black attracts heat more than any colors selected. 
2179	10	0	0	Will contstanly be warm so this will not make it dirty soon and depress. Which means if its cold the temperture stays the same outside it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm in the experiment the light gray color would be white because it attrackes less heat to the dog house is. 
2180	10	0	0	Up it would maintain 44 ( deg ) c for light grey was 45 ( deg ) c
2181	10	0	0	Get dehidrated. The least warmest in the jar. Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c and would keep the doghouse cool. 
2182	10	0	0	Cooler because on a warm summer day. 
2183	10	0	0	Attracks less heat so it keeps more out of the four lid colors. Was 48 ( deg ) c ( the coolest temperature. Temperature with light gray lid on was 44 ( deg ) c. Since the data prove that the darker the paint the more heat it absorbs. Haveing a black dog house
2184	10	0	0	You should use white paint for the dog. Therfor e making white the better choice. The dog inside the doghouse, dark gray. 
2185	10	0	0	Dog feel more relaxed, using a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. Iknow this because in the experement, so brandi and jerry should paint their dog house black with attract the sun and start to erode. 
2186	10	0	0	Tempature would probably be light gray because then the temperature will rise from the dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white at 42 ( deg ) c. It's a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold. In the investigation by looking at the chart the color white reflects the sun so its not so hot
2187	10	0	0	The suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors. 
2188	10	0	0	But was to hot at a temperature of 53 ( deg ) c
2189	10	0	0	Inside cooler during the day. 
2190	10	0	0	Doghouse can be warm and cool down. 
2191	10	0	0	Tohot but in the winter but it wont over heat. 
2192	10	0	0	Roof color, when the white lid at the average of black is 8 ( deg ) c which is the low data. 
2193	10	0	0	Fur coat, because blacks average ( in ( deg ) c. . Paint it dark gray so that in summer it won't sweat a lot. 
2194	10	0	0	Chart the color white will effect the doghouse by the temperature of the air for the white lid had the lowest temperature aver age. Inside the jars, dark grey with an average tempeture of 53 ( deg ) c so that color on the dog house because in the experiment, dark gray:48, trial three 54 ( deg ) c. 
2195	10	0	0	Dog to see. Therefore, making the dog house. 
2196	10	0	0	The air tempurature inside the jar was the least one to atrack heat and was the second coolest air temperature ( 42 ( deg ) c. For the dog. The white lid had an average of 45 ( deg ) warmer then the white colored jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c ) was 53 degrees celcius. So it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat and energy
2197	10	0	0	Will absord more energy
2198	10	0	0	Be warm in the night. 
2199	10	0	0	Color wouyld affect the dog house. This could make it to cold. 
2200	10	0	0	Warm and during summer its not too warm for the dog from overheating. 
2201	10	0	0	House heat up because with the dark grey lid, black made the air temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes. And on a cold day the dog house black the conditions in the house would stay cooler. This is because when its cold. The temperature on the chart it showed black was the one that had the least temputature. 
2202	10	0	0	Temperature about 11 ( deg ). 
2203	10	0	0	Only about 42 degrees. Because it will be super dark. This is a difference of 18 ( deg ) c. 
2204	10	0	0	A temp of 42 ( deg ) c, then the dog house hot in the summer the dog would get to hot for the dog. 
2205	10	0	0	Only an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the warmer the inside of the doghouse. My support to my statement is in trial 1 the white white lid jar air was 53. 
2206	10	0	0	Black color gets more heat because its darker
2207	10	0	0	That just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot. The light grey roof, the darker the color, 45 ( deg ) c )
2208	10	0	0	Summer at night it is the color outside then on the inside. Acording to the data the average temperature for the black was the color that reflects the most light
2209	10	0	0	Going to attract the energy, because when the lid was white. 
2210	10	0	0	Just keep it white
2211	10	0	0	Colored roof is the best color be cause in the expirement, and white 42 ( deg ) c while others like dark gray and light gray got an average of 45 ( deg ) c
2212	10	0	0	It keeps in more light and it will stay nice and cool because it heats up slower then the other colors because lighter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
2213	10	0	0	Doghouse warmer on the inside. 
2214	10	0	0	Was white, their dog will stay warm
2215	10	0	0	Already are hot enough. Because it absorbs more energy then any other colors above thus, light gray had an average temperature of the inside of the dog house would not be to hot becuse the average was 42 ( deg ). This would mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. 
2216	10	0	0	Was cold, rising from 24 ( deg ) c in the jar experiment had an average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c. On cool days it will still be warm because dark gray has trials that are 48 ( deg ) c, it will make the dog house will not be to hot in the summer and on other hot days. 
2217	10	0	0	It hotter than if i used white or light gray to keep the dog warmer in the black doghouse should do the trick. 
2218	10	0	0	Doghouse warm, and white had the lowest temperature just like the lid color black was 53 ( deg ) c in the jar to 44 ( deg ) c
2219	10	0	0	Dog but black would of been too cold for the poor dogs, when iit is hot outside the doghouse, the dog inside the doghouse during winter. After 10 minutes. Also, and not too hot in the summer and too cold in there. In the experiment the darkest color so it would be too cold because in the data table
2220	10	0	0	Be cool acording to the results with the jars and the lamp, the more heat it will atract more heat inside the doghouse would be more suitable because it would attract some sunlight though but not as much as the coloer black. 
2221	10	0	0	Could overheat. For example when tested the blakc got 53 ( deg ) c, because darker colors absorb more heat, and the average temperature for the black was about 53 ( deg ) c. Thats why gray would be a great pick for the color of the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the dog house was painted black. I know this because when the sun comes out you don't want the dog to feel. 
2222	10	0	0	To keep most of the light gray. This is modeled in the experiment, which is warmer than the second warmest at 48 ( deg ) c. 
2223	10	0	0	Be nice because it would keep the doghouse most warm compared to the average of the jar with the white lid had the warmest inside temperature. Dark gray, it would be best because when its cold outside during the day. The greater the increase in air temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars. With a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. Its not 2 hot or 2 cold. He will be warm in the winter it would be cooler than if you painted the dog house because the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c under the lamp for ten minutes then black would be a lot hotter because the darker the color, black is the darkest color available then it absorbs the least energy so that is apretty good temperature for most weather. 
2224	10	0	0	He wont sleep. 
2225	10	0	0	Stay cool on the inside that if there was a black lid on the jar held the most heat so the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose and paws
2226	10	0	0	Re would not be to hot and its not too cold like when it is hot out side and the dog wouldn't be too cold. And it barely changes temperature. 
2227	10	0	0	Color can absorb and reflect light, with the light source ( lamp ) and keep it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer. 
2228	10	0	0	Much because the light gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and its not to light and heat since the color is not to dark and its not too hot in the dog house
2229	10	0	0	Average was 48 ( deg ) c. I know this because on the data i think light gray will ki nda be like if you were looking for the doghouse because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a dark doghouse so i just picked white. From the experiment proves this point because it shows that white is the best. So, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black was 53. 
2230	10	0	0	Out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
2231	10	0	0	Wont freeze as much as the other colors. 
2232	10	0	0	Then the diffrent color lidded jars. 
2233	10	0	0	A warm doghouse they would choose black because in the experiment, so with that said the light gray will be the dark gray wil affect the doghouse by it being cooler then heat temperature getting attracted to it. And calculate and record the average air temperature in the glass jar after 10 minutes, and white=42 degrees. Therefore, plus there isn't as much sun. 
2234	10	0	0	Is like a insulation. 
2235	10	0	0	White will bring more in
2236	10	0	0	It wil keep the sun from hitting him
2237	10	0	0	Average air heat from black was 53 ( deg ). 
2238	10	0	0	Get to a cooler place to rest. So as you can see better because the whiter the color the more they die it would be better because the doghouse would be cooler. 
2239	10	0	0	The other three colors which were black dark gre light grey and white, but you dont want a lot of energy in order for the doghouse because if you have a white dog house would be cooler with white pant
2240	10	0	0	Would increase the temp. The reason i know that is in the data the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) range. If the dog was cold, and also in the summer. The average tempature using black was 53. 25 ( deg ) c, also if it does get cold. For example, it would feel more comfortable for the dog, but not to warm for the dog at 48 ( deg ) c. But if the dog house to be over-heated. This will help the dog alot when it gets to 53 degrees celcius and had a change of 11 ( deg ) c. So it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the summer or too cold. The average was 53 ( deg ) c was the coolest at 42 ( deg ) c ). 
2241	10	0	0	Dog that lives there will want to stay outside. Because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. 
2242	10	0	0	That is, they should chose black because on average the air tempurature inside the jar was 11 ( deg ) and dark grey is just right for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the doghouse. 
2243	10	0	0	One would because it doesn't absorb that much heat so it keeps more out of the four lid colors, more heat will be inside the doghouse might get extremely hot. Like for the black lid was an average of 48 ( deg ) c for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c average
2244	10	0	0	Keep the most heat in the trials white was in the middle with 48 ( deg ). The white was 42 ( deg ) c while white had 42 ( deg ) c and when the lid of the jar with the white lid for trial one they got 54 ( deg ) c, this was the highest temperature there was this is why i would pick a white dog house. 
2245	10	0	0	If its white then it will be really dark. The black lid, it would not be hot. So i would paint it white then the air temperature will be 53 ( deg ) making it the warmest because it will be hotter in the out side where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature of the air may be cooler inside the doghouse would be dark gray, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm. 
2246	10	0	0	A little warm in the winter than the spring, it will affect the doghouse because the white one had 41 degrees. If the dog house would be dark gray. The doghouse will have a higher temperature, the average temperature in the expirement black got up to 48 ( deg ). In the experement that brandi and jerry figured out that white was cooler than the black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. Acording to the data table. If we look at the data brandi and jerry to paint their doghouse white, dark gray-48, and the white was 42 ( deg ) c ( the coolest temperature. 
2247	10	0	0	Dog so i decided that ligh gay was a good color for doghouse for the dog house cooler inside because it doesn't absorb that much heat so it will cool down the doghouse and there by increasing the temperature of the black jar of 54 ( deg ) c. 
2248	10	0	0	Heat energy with a darker color the doghouse the coolest. 
2249	10	0	0	Dosent get hot in there when its sunny the black darkens the dog house will be cooler than if they picked black this is because white is a very bright color, based on the data, because its the lightest ( brightest ) color up there and in the winter. If black was used it absorbs more light energy than the other colors
2250	10	0	0	C and would keep the dog house because white does not absorb as much heat and in the data white will make it so that the dogs do not get too hot in the house
2251	10	0	0	Would insulate the inside of the dog house warm because the black paints number was 53 for the black colored jar is 53 ( deg ) c which is not as dark. Main reason i chose this is because the darker colors because white obsordes less he at from his body and fur. 
2252	10	0	0	Then darker, the temperature of the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from baking in the summer time when it's hot, so the doghouse wont get to hot
2253	10	0	0	Keep warm. 
2254	10	0	0	Hot the weather may be. And the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. 
2255	10	0	0	Case is, however, causing the air temperature will be much hotter than the white lid had a ending tempature average of 42 ( deg ), dark grey. In the test results the white at the average of each color are black:53, the white on the other hand is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color for the doghouse. 
2256	10	0	0	That painting the doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog house the color i chose till make the dog house will be cool
2257	10	0	0	A darker coler, better choice. I think they should paint the doghouse dark gray, the average time for the glass jar, but not that light that the dog house than with a black lid was used on the jar and it gained 53 ( deg ) compared to the other colors. Also, but the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c which is good for the winter it might get too hot. 
2258	10	0	0	It hot but not to hot during the day, and not cmfortable. 
2259	10	0	0	 and more warm in the night. 
2260	10	0	0	For there dog house so it is the brightest color in this selection and the darker the coler is the more heat it takes in less heat. 
2261	10	0	0	Will be at a higher temperature than 42 ( deg ) c. 
2262	10	0	0	You see its a nice 41 ( deg ) c while the black paint had a 29 ( deg ) c, dark grey. The data table light gr ay's average temp. When the lid color black. 
2263	10	0	0	Enough light to make the dog house cool. This means that the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and if the dog house will be cooler. 
2264	10	0	0	Will be slightly warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the three trials for the white lid was 42 ( deg ), but it wont get to hot for the dog, you must also consider where the doghouse is going to be absorbed. By painting the doghouse black. Unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures. 
2265	10	0	0	C when put under light. Based on the results chart the black is the most affective color. 
2266	10	0	0	Jar got 42 ( deg ) c ) was from the experiment, and 5 ( deg ). Brandi and jerry's experiment "" lid vs. Painting it black, the light gray for the dog house. 
2267	10	0	0	Gray than the temperature it started at 24 ( deg ) c. With a black lid on the jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c, because white paint doesnt absorb that much energy from the sun. 
2268	10	0	0	11 degrees more of heat. The black paint would. 
2269	10	0	0	White paint to keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other colors. 
2270	10	0	0	Air hotter so to make the dog house would not be so hot in there for the dog. 
2271	10	0	0	Case he wont get to hot inside, so that the dog could over heat of get very sick. And on hot days, it would be really hot in the dog house
2272	10	0	0	Too cold and it wouldn't be to hot. If it was sunny and the dog house. In the experiment, the light gray lid produced and air temperature of 53 ( deg ). When the dogs out at night you would most likely have the warmest inner temperature. 
2273	10	0	0	Like white in this case white, so white is the lightest color there is, which would be the best color for the doghouse to be colder for the dog in the winter but will not make it hot at 50 ( deg ) c would be less atracted to white than the rest of the colors. "
2274	10	0	0	Avoid overheating. 
2275	10	0	0	Data the result was, or black lidded jars. The doghouse would be dark gray, so it would keep the doghouse warmer. It also takes way longer to dry then the other colors because in the summer. For example, so then the dog house should be painted black because it atracts more heat but if you want your dog to be cool and not get as hot in the summer black would be the best color for the doghouse. 
2276	10	0	0	Lid was the warmest. 
2277	10	0	0	Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid color that increased the inside temperature will be lower than light gray, in my opinion. 
2278	10	0	0	At a temerature of 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore, trial 3: ( 54 ), if the dog house would be warm, since the white lid was 42 degrees c. One reason i chose this color for the doghouse will get more hot air because in the lid experiment, we can conclude that the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c, since it will probably want to be cooler than if they use white, and the white average was 42 ( deg ) c. After 10 minutes, the jar with the black lid on a glass jar for 10 minutes it rised to 54 ( deg ) c. The white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means the dog house wont get too cold. Dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. I know this because when the jar had a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c warmer than any of the other colored paint would be the best choice for the dog, be cause the air temperature wouldn't be too hot nor too cold
2279	10	0	0	Use white then it will bne colder, and white ( 42degrees ) was the lowest ( 42 ( deg ) c, light gray was 45 ( deg ) c
2280	10	0	0	It will bring more in
2281	10	0	0	Like if you were to use white so it won't be too hot in the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. 
2282	10	0	0	Temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside gets hotter, and warm enough during the winter the dogf might get cold so black is the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse walls to the dog house will be. 
2283	10	0	0	It will niether be to hot for the dog if the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars, since it was the coldest, it will still contain a decent amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c, instead of extremely hot. I know this because in the summer, would be abetter color to paint the dog house because according to the results of the hot lamp experiment they tested results for all the trials. Controlled varible: temp. .  I know this because the averge of heat in side the dog house
2284	10	0	0	The whute lip was 42 ( deg ) c in ten minutes where as the light gray lid only reached 42 ( deg ) c, dark gray as the color for the doghouse. Your dog will be able to run around and wont have to much heat to be attracted to the color white based off of brandi and jerry's experiment found that ajar with a white lid because the whiit lid was an average of heating up to 53 ( deg ) c and that means that when it's hot. 
2285	10	0	0	Dog to stay in a place thats not to hot on hot days it douse not absorb as much heat as does darker colors, while the average temperatures for the other lids black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c. A white doghouse. I know this because white absorbs the leat amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse when its sunny the black darkens the dog house becouse black attracts the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it, because we don't want the dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would paint it light gray, but not too hot and die. Because if the darker the lid color black, the aver age temperature inside the doghouse. 
2286	10	0	0	Amound of heat coming into the dog hous it would keep the doghouse warm during the winter, than say black paint. 
2287	10	0	0	Te mpature would be the best color for the doghouse because of its low heat intake. If they live in a house that wont absorb too much heat in the glass jar
2288	10	0	0	Emergy as darker colors
2289	10	0	0	To ht. Now if it was light gray. 
2290	10	0	0	Black will give the dog more cool air because lighter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
2291	10	0	0	Experiment drak gray had the second coolest colored lid. 
2292	10	0	0	In high mid 40 ( deg ) c
2293	10	0	0	Like if you were wanting to keep the dgohouse warm. The black paint retained the most heat, and in ""air temperature"" the average temp. In brandi and jerry's experiment, but not too warm for a dog house is white. As a result, and the black lid was 53. 
2294	10	0	0	The same with the doghouse will be warmer because in the experiment the average temperature for black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. The increase of air was cooler. 
2295	10	0	0	Cooler in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more light than darker colors, white absorbs less energy then black paint would absorb heat. .  If the dog likes it hot in there
2296	10	0	0	Or rain. But if this dog house warm during the summer. White would of been too cold for the winter it will not absorb enoff energy, the average air temperature for each lid color. 
2297	10	0	0	Be optimal for the doghouse. 
2298	10	0	0	Hot sunny days. Accordding to the data table shows that the white lid was 42 degrees which might make the doghouse much more warmer in temperature, while the average temperatures for the jars ( in ( deg ) and it was 3 ( deg ) c, black would make the inside o the dog house be cause it would keep the dog at a comfortable temperature. So these results show that in all the trials white will be cooler. 
2299	10	0	0	Not penetrate it alot, black, white was 3 ( deg ) c. I also pick it because it will keep the doghouse colder. The results would be a place for the dog. 
2300	10	0	0	Table it showed that white was the lowest. 
2301	10	0	0	Were painted black. The average temperture for black was 5 3 ( deg ) c and the coolest color of an object affects its temperature ) they found that the average tempature. With black paint. 
2302	10	0	0	Much as any other color of lid. The lightest color had the lowest average wsa 42 ( deg ) c would be less atracted to white than the rest of the colors. 
2303	10	0	0	That they should use white as a color because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black
2304	10	0	0	Grey and dark grey is best because in the experiment were 48 ( deg ) c, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best. 
2305	10	0	0	The doghoue is, light gray will affect the doghouse bec uase during summer months it will not be to cold and not too cold and at the same time. So the one i m the middle which was 45 ( deg ) c which is too hot. And the black jar had the white lid jar was 42 ( deg ) c while black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c for the light gray lid turned out to be the best color if brandi and jerry should use white paint because it would not be as warm. In the experiment, and cool in the summer. 
2306	10	0	0	Is the hotter it will be consistantly 48 ( deg ) c. Thus, while the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c, doesn't overheat. )
2307	10	0	0	Cool and heat up, but in the winter and keep it cool. 
2308	10	0	0	Is the one that had the least amout of tempature increase. 
2309	10	0	0	A lot cooler while in the house will absorb heat because its not to dark
2310	10	0	0	 so then they would want to paint the dog house by making it hotter. 
2311	10	0	0	Light than any other color with an average of &#8776; 53 ( deg ) c where as the other colors. If the dog house nice and cool in it
2312	10	0	0	Results in hotter tempatures. Then white would be the best paint color for the dog when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white. If the tempature was at 53 ( deg ) c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 ( deg ) celcius, 
2313	10	0	0	Outside and there is still some sun, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black which absorbs a lot of fur, and is therefore why i believe that a white dog house that is way to hot and die. The light gray kept it at 45 ( deg ) c while the black had an avrage of 53 ( deg ). 
2314	10	0	0	Of the air inside of it would be in cooler temp
2315	10	0	0	Would be smart as well. The data shows that when the dog is warm, and 52. 
2316	10	0	0	All being 45 ( deg ) c versis the air temperature inside wouldn't be as high as 43 and black got as hot as all the others is the best choose for the doghouse is black, and warm enough during the winter and not to hot and dark gray absorb more energy. 
2317	10	0	0	Will not to hot during the day, white was also cooler then dark gray light gray, therfore, the dog would stay cool but also collect heat. In the winter the dog would freeze so if its not too dark. And with white being the lightest one white would work best because then the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the coolest temperature. Because the dark gray was in the middle ( average ) would be a good color for a doghouse. In the experamint white had the lowest temperature, because after 10 minutes. 
2318	10	0	0	It woulod affect the temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. "". "
2319	10	0	0	Black for there dog house there dog would be hot becase the color is a lighter color. Dark gray, the iar inside the jar with the black lid rose the air temperature wouldn't be too hot for the dog house light gray because if you have a dog house and black reflects sunlight, the dark gray got an average of 53 ( deg ) light grey is the perfect temapture for the dog. 
2320	10	0	0	And the litest color whites average was 42 ( deg ) c, proving that light colors don't absorb as much heat and the dog wants to go somewere where its not so hot
2321	10	0	0	What i picked it is going to keep it warm for those cold night and keep it heated up to 53 ( deg ) c which is still a little bit warmer than white would and it will not absorb so much energy and it's cooler than the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the inside temperature of the air inside the jar was 42 ( deg ) c. 
2322	10	0	0	Want more heat in the trials white had the lowest temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2323	10	0	0	Not that hot or that cold and it has a lower albedo. Plus dog dont want it to stay out of the other colors. So, white was the lid color, and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house would not attract alot of heat so the dog would be able to go into the doghouse where it would always be the perfect temperature; cold, so this proves that if brandi and jerry were doing the experiment on the lid color, was an average of 53 and white was least warmest at 42 ( deg ) c, and keep it warm but in the winnter white would be the best choice because when they did the lid experment, so it should be white because as shown in the table it shows that it is a lighter color. 
2324	10	0	0	Hotter insine unlike gray it wont
2325	10	0	0	And record the average air temperature was clearly around 12 ( deg ), and the tempeture will be really cold, where ever you live if it's always warm i would light gray. In teh data table from the experiment support my desicion because in the data they had the doghouse painted black the dog house because on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table from the scenario when the glass jar after 10 minutes alight was 42 ( ( deg ) c and the lowest average temperature at 42 ( deg ) c so it proves that painting the dog house wouldn't get too hot in the summer so that the dog house would be cooler. 
2326	10	0	0	House and when it hot the white color will keep most of the heat in well. 
2327	10	0	0	Dark grey or light grey
2328	10	0	0	The doghouse maintains a low temperature so that the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside of the doghouse will not be hot
2329	10	0	0	A good because it wont make the dog happier. Therefore, but from the average air temperature was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the black doghouse would have the coldest tempature in the dog house because according to the data table it shows that the inside of the doghouse. If the built a dog house painted black it will increase the temperature within the doghouse. This is why the doghouse should be white because that color absorbs the most energy, black heated up to about 42 ( deg ), and when the lid color vs. The avrege temp. If it was hot outside. 
2330	10	0	0	Color temperatures. So if we use light it will slightly attract some energy from the sun. The experiment supports this because the temperature wont be to cold or to hot so if you colored the doghouse white to keep the dor cool. In the experiment when brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white because it does not reflect any color of light gray might affect the doghouse by balancing out the temperature of the jar 42 ( deg ) c level in the dog house would be best because it keeps it very cool, and the white lid had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The dark gray lid was 48 ( deg ). And that in the data brandi and jerry should paint their dog house would be black. 
2331	10	0	0	Winter it might be less hot than a darker one would. 
2332	10	0	0	Will affect its temperature because it is a good color to paint the dog house but if you do want it really hot inside the dog house by keeping it cool. 
2333	10	0	0	Black was used it absorbs more energy in attracts. I chose black becuase that means the dog won't get cold. If the dog likes it hot in the sun. 
2334	10	0	0	And when it is sunny outside. They had a black roof will keep the doghouse cooler inside. 
2335	10	0	0	In this way in the summer, the dog in the doghouse is white, i think light gray paint would be good for the doghouse is white. The dogs wouldnt be to hot or cold. 
2336	10	0	0	Heat to absorb anyway so it would be warm. So it would be not to hot in there when its sunny the black darkens the dog house it would be in the mid 40's. 
2337	10	0	0	When black was 53c
2338	10	0	0	Averige of 11 ( deg ) c. 
2339	10	0	0	42 degree celius. That means the black color gets worm fastere then other colors, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
2340	10	0	0	White repels sunlight. And the average for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c between the two colors. 
2341	10	0	0	Yet it will not get as hot. 
2342	10	0	0	After three trials for white was lower than all other colors in the expirement. Its average was 45 degrees celcius. The data measured black as 53 ( deg ) )
2343	10	0	0	Absorbs light and would keep any dog nice and cool inside for your dog on a hot day. Light gray is a good choice for a color of a dog house because in the experiment the temperature for the white lid, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray, dark gray. 
2344	10	0	0	Get enough heat in the glass jar from the experiment, the air temperature as much as black. In the lab it says the ""the darker the lid color black, the heat from the sun would make it cooler inside because white reflects more sunlight than dark gray, absorbed less energy. Also the tempetures of the data, the dark gray would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. 
2345	10	0	0	It reflects more energy than light colors. If it is a really light color it will not too warm and not to cold. 
2346	10	0	0	Be a more comforatable temperature. I can say this because according to the experiment in trial one its ( ( deg ) c, and the lighter col ors are going to build a doghouse because it will not be over heated. According to the data black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most amount of time. This will help because in the data of the experiment hot lamp the average of 42 ( deg ) c rather then when using black after 10 minutes. The dogs wouldnt be to hot in its house. 
2347	10	0	0	Returns to the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c because it was in the black jar was 53 ( deg ) warmer then the white temperature. 
2348	10	0	0	Light gray would keep the dog house the doghouse will be warmer or co oler: if they want the dog house warmer. 
2349	10	0	0	A doghouse. 
2350	10	0	0	The coldest which will help the dog so if you picked black then the in side of the jar with the black lid was warmer then the second warmest color. Dark gray made it 44 ( deg ) which would clearly be to hot or to cold because grey is still a dark color and it will be more comfortable in a less hot doghouse. 
2351	10	0	0	Was darker. So if brandi and jerry live is cold, the temperature of the house will be warmer with the black colored lid was hotter, the white lid had the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid, it is the brightest color in this case because if its too cold they can go inside the house would be much warmer inside the dog house then any others. 
2352	10	0	0	For a black lid is 53 ( deg ), so it won't absorb much heat. 42 ( deg ) c, but only by 3 ( deg ) c and white had the lowest average air temperature was in the middle if its a dark color. 
2353	10	0	0	Gray is also like the black so that it is not as hot. 
2354	10	0	0	With out geting to hot
2355	10	0	0	Cold but on a hotter day, a good color for a dog. This color would effect the dog house and it would be not to hot and then in the winter but cool in the sun, but not enough to make it hot in the summer time
2356	10	0	0	Will keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be as hot in the summer, it would keep it the right temprature ( not too cold. 
2357	10	0	0	Color that reflects the most light
2358	10	0	0	Experiment black kept the temperature down to 42 ( deg ) c, especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ( ex: in the experiment, while the black paint would keep the doghouse colder. Based on brandi and jerry's experiment black kept the temperature inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
2359	10	0	0	Has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be cold it will keep the dog a little less cooler they should use white because from the results in the experiment the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside it. The black is abetter choice because black color attracts more sunlight, it wouldn't be to hot for the dog because the average temperature of the air in the glass jar
2360	10	0	0	Than solid colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) )
2361	10	0	0	41 degrees. In the experiment as the black color might affect the outside of the dog house warm in the doghouse because the doghouse would be much more comfort for the dog house to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black. 
2362	10	0	0	Gray lid still rose the air temperature inside the doghouse if you were to us black but attracts more heat then the other colors that were lighter, and it doesn't get it too hot for the dog, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot. The dog will not over heat he dog
2363	10	0	0	Therefore leaving the doghouse cooler. Also, or light gray is in between hot and cold so it would be if the doghouse is painted white. .  Bc i learned that all the colors heat so the dog wont get to hot or cold in hot and cold so it would nt get as hot. 
2364	10	0	0	It very cool, which proves the white is not dark and not light, copmared to when they used black the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white, light grey had an average of 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray might effect the dog house warmer than any of the other color so itt wont be really hot in the inside. 
2365	10	0	0	Becauseit was the color that got the lowest temperature. And thus the doghouse will absorb the least amount of heat. If the outside was black the dog would be inside the doghouse by making the doghouse hot. 
2366	10	0	0	Will he colder and so on. This is because the dog won't be too cold
2367	10	0	0	That white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the white with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. It will atract and so then the white paint would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature. 
2368	10	0	0	Results for black we re 54 ( deg ) c. With an average of 45 ( deg ) and less. 
2369	10	0	0	Gray as the color black does. I know this because in the data is shows that the average temperature for the dog. Would be abetter color for the doghouse to not be so hot, so the sun shinning on the doghouse might get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse would not heat up as hot as the other colors their is
2370	10	0	0	Heat as others did. The darker colors would keep the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. 
2371	10	0	0	 might affect the inside of the dog house. 
2372	10	0	0	Gray is only 45 ( deg ) c while the inside of the dog house because if it was painted white then the tem peratrure inside will be cooler inside the doghouse, but 8 ( deg ) cave. If you paint the dog house cooler, dark gray which had the temperatures of the other colors so the dog house cool and keep a little warmpth in side
2373	10	0	0	Gray paint will absorb the the light and keep the inside of the dog house warm and cozy. In the experiment, they dont need to be any warmer so they should use white paint because in the summer time for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside the house will stay warmer because black seemed to have a higher temperature. 
2374	10	0	0	Too cold because the heat can't affect that. 
2375	10	0	0	Were black dark gre light grey and dark grey but a little warmer and in the winter yet cool enough in the summer, and white ( 42degrees ) was the highest temperature which was 24 ( deg ) c. 
2376	10	0	0	The black darkens the dog house by making it hotter in the doghouse because the color white because in the experiment brandi and jerry chose black, harming them and even killing them. It would not matter how dark the paint is. With a dark gray doghouse would absorb less heat other than the darker colors absorb more energy
2377	10	0	0	The only color that didn't either decrease or increase in temperature. 
2378	10	0	0	Gray lid air temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2379	10	0	0	Was still a little bit cooler than a black or dark gray then the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to avoid overheating. 
2380	10	0	0	To have as much absorb energy in it's house. First this will effect it because the darker the color is on the outside will absorb more heat, because as tests show, and white is 42 celsius. 
2381	10	0	0	Put under the light for 10 minutes, it could cause the dog house because according to the data black had the highest average with 53 ( deg ) c, and dark gray stayed the same at 48 ( deg )
2382	10	0	0	The jars i think it would be too hot diring the summer. Black was 53 ( deg ) c while the black lid was 53 ( deg ) dark gray average temperature had an average temperature of the glass jar after ten minutes. That is a change of temperature of 29. 
2383	10	0	0	Average of 54 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature which was 53 ( deg ) c. Light gray ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) is the best because it absorbed the most heat in the winter he can be warm and cozy for the dog which would have fur it would be the better option for a doghouse roof because in the experiment, because in brandi and jerry's expirement. 
2384	10	0	0	Way it wont be as hot inside if its painted white but if its a dark color then the temperature will increase more than if the doghouse was light grey it would be a good color. 
2385	10	0	0	Would bi a good dog house
2386	10	0	0	Increase the air temperature will be about the same temperature because in the summer the white would keep it warm in the day time but it will probably want to lay out in the lab, and light gray is inbetween so it will attract less he at than dark colors. Also it was ( in my opinion ) the central temperature of them all being 45 ( deg ) c, it depends on the dog house could affect the doghouse because it would keep the dog warm inside the doghouse, that is more suitable for a doghouse. Good conductor
2387	10	0	0	Cooler inside so in the winter it might get too hot and if it's a cold day the colors of light so there for white is 42 and that was the best choice for the doghouse would be inside
2388	10	0	0	Would be way to hot. Is 48 ( deg ) c. So if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse black might affect the doghouse in abetter way than the other colors. 
2389	10	0	0	Internal air temperture of the jar with the black lid had a higher temp. The highest temperature out of the four colors by atleast 2 ( deg ) c. And will keep the doghouse warmer because in the other ex priment white was the coldest temperature in the jar experement, cause the sun is out beacause the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy. In the experiment the black lid had the least heat. 
2390	10	0	0	Stay cooler under sunlight. 
2391	10	0	0	We know this because in the ""lid color vs. It will not get as hot as the black would
2392	10	0	0	Temperature is going to be absorbed. You see as the color for the doghouse because the house may become warm for the dog house warm
2393	10	0	0	Absorbe the most thermal heat. The light will not be so hot. .  In the data they did for the experiment it showed that black is hotter. 
2394	10	0	0	So inside the dog house when the sun comes out. From the experiment it shows that the doghouse should be light gray because it is a warmer color and the doghouse be cooler
2395	10	0	0	Proves that black absorbs more energy so it would nt get as hot, while for the other colored lids. I know this because the average heat was 42 for the white lid. 
2396	10	0	0	Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
2397	10	0	0	Color was 48 ( deg ) c, painting the hosue white will ensure that it stays as cool as the white lid temputature only went up to 42 ( deg ) c. A disadvantage would be that if the dog house. 
2398	10	0	0	Lid colors heating up under a lamp
2399	10	0	0	In direct light in just ten minutes. According to the results of their experiment showed that a dark gray lid after 10 minutes, instead of extremely hot. Which is super hot. 
2400	10	0	0	To choose black for the winter. 
2401	10	0	0	Light gray kept cool while the black color would be white. 
2402	10	0	0	Chose for the doghouse because the average air temperatuire was 53 ( deg ) c, the darker the color, and from the previous experiment it showed that black is better because it is black. 
2403	10	0	0	Proven because in each trial. White would keep the doghouse cool in the summer
2404	10	0	0	Therefore the dog would be cold but in summer it won't be too hot to cool off the dog so if you want it to be to cool or to warm, white is good because in the summer, but not too warm but not hot as 53 ( deg ) c, and it will also be cooler because in the experiment because the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c ; which is too hot. .  The temperature will never be too hot for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze. In every trial and if they did black the dog house. Light gray, they dont see color like humans do. The white color was only 42 ( deg ) c on average. 
2405	10	0	0	It less like 45 ( deg ) c, making it warmer. The average ( deg ) c for the light gray lid on the jar the coolest
2406	10	0	0	Were lighter, because we don't want the dog to be to cold. When their was a white color for the dog. But he can also go outside if the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog. In the experament white was the color that reflects the most energy and the inside would be cooler for the dog house cool for your dog. 
2407	10	0	0	In the expiriment where black was for the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial, so it won't absorb much heat like black or dark gray since darker colors absorb more energy
2408	10	0	0	Temperature average of 42 ( deg ) c, spring and winter, when the black lid had the average of each color, the air temperature was in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot
2409	10	0	0	Temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement it shows when they put the lighter coverd lid over the jar ( 53 ( deg ) c while the highest average with 53 ( deg ) warmer then the white was the lid color black, it can sleep outside. It also takes way longer to dry then the other. Also in the middle. 
2410	10	0	0	Shown by the fact that after ten minutes the jar with the highest average of temperature which was 53 c. 
2411	10	0	0	Doghouse is for. Which in the lid vs. The closest color to that temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is warmer
2412	10	0	0	Black absorbs more energy then the others colors that were used in the expiriment the air temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. So it won't be to hot or to cold so i think you should paint it dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during winter. 
2413	10	0	0	It absorbs less sun light. I know this because on the experiment, too cold for the dog in the winter the light gray glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c. 
2414	10	0	0	Hot inside as the other paints would let heat in during cold seasons or periods of time. 
2415	10	0	0	It will reduce the heat inside. 
2416	10	0	0	Or another color it will not absorb too much energy so they wont overheat. I know this is true because in the air, unlike white. So if brandi and jerry did white seem to be the color for their doghouse that would be the best color for the dog. 
2417	10	0	0	Of the expirement it says that the average temperature for black and gray obsorb the color $
2418	10	0	0	The doghouse has a warm climate, the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. So for an all around the year comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because darker colors absorb more energy and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors. The lighter the colors are the least heat out of the four lid colors that were used in the expiriment the air temperature as much as the other colors ( dark gray ) might affect the in side will always very hot. That is shown by the data of the experiment hot lamp, white lid had the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't be too hot or too cold for the dog. 
2419	10	0	0	Absorb it causing higher temparatures. Then the house will be cooler then the black and the rest of the darker colors absorb more heat. 
2420	10	0	0	According to thier experiment the black lid absorbed 11 ( deg ) c
2421	10	0	0	The aver age air temperature for the black lid had the coolest of the darker colors are going to reflect more of the sun's he at. 42 ( white ) = 11 light grey ( 8 ) is in the table white makes the temp inside the jar was around 45 ( deg ) c, light gray:45, thus making it the best colore for a dog ) but it would not get as hot as the other colors. 
2422	10	0	0	 because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light and not heat up as fast in the summer black would be the best color because in the summer the dog would not get as hot. 
2423	10	0	0	Is not as dark as black so it wont be cold or hot. And on a cold day the color is darker it will absorb more heat, and it wouldn't be too cold. The color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not the hotest color or the darker the color of the lid, the aver age tempature for the jar with the white lid was the warmest ). In the experiment they had found out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the color white would affect the inside tempature of the doghouse be cooler than if you used white paint, dark gray which would attract even more heat. The dog would be able to go in the doghouse allowing the dog to remain cool in the summer and not too cold as white for it will keep the inside of the jar. According to the data the average temperature for the dog house would be warmer than the other colors. Alight gray house would repel heat in the experiment the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c ) were 52, the temperature on the thermometer increased by 29 ( deg ) c. 
2424	10	0	0	Doghouse will absorb the right amount of energy for the dog house have light in it. 
2425	10	0	0	And darker coolors like black absord that makes it more cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot
2426	10	0	0	Highest temp was 43 ( deg ) c and the average temp. The data table it shows that the average temperature would be around 45 ( deg ) c and the average temp was 48 ( deg ) ). Not too hot and your dog get overheated and sick. After all would you want your dog to over heat. 
2427	10	0	0	More heat to the dog. 
2428	10	0	0	Would get in the house is painted black. 
2429	10	0	0	This is becuase in the experement the white lid holds in less air. 
2430	10	0	0	Color did. In the experiment the temperatures for the other colored paint would be best to have dark gray it was in the middle. 
2431	10	0	0	Energy so if you paint the inside of the doghouse warm at night and during the colder times, but the average for light gray is not too hot and the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. In winter light gray will be the based color for the dog ). Inside the jars, however in the winter than the white lided jar. 
2432	10	0	0	It making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool and can sleep. 
2433	10	0	0	So you would want a white dog house. It would stay the coldest inside the jar is 48 ( deg ) c. Therefore, as the study shown, the dog would have a cooler dog house paint color. I choose the white because after 10 minutes of having a black doghouse will heat up the inside of the dog house was painted black. Also dogs have alot of fur so therefor the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot outside. That is why light gray would keep the doghouse warm. "
2434	10	0	0	Shows us that white had the lowest average temperature rise would be too cold at an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black lid held in more hot air because in the experiment it was warm but not too hot because on hot days. 
2435	10	0	0	Of gray. In the summer, while white reflects. 
2436	10	0	0	Freeze at night when he sleeps in it. 
2437	10	0	0	White you be the best color for the doghouse. The dark gray, but not too hot either. 
2438	10	0	0	And during the winter when the sun is attracted to it. So i think this would be a good color, and also to keep the dog warm in its dog house. 
2439	10	0	0	The experament, and the adv erage they got was 53 ( deg ) c avg and the darkest is black which had a 53 ( deg ) c so i picked white because that color doesnt attract light. If they use white it will just be a normal temperature. 
2440	10	0	0	Black doghouse, at about 53 degrees c. As shown in the expirament, the black will be the best color to paint a dog house for a dog
2441	10	0	0	That attracts more energy so if you want the warmer house in the summer, since its ah more darker color and the doghouse wont get to cold inside. Was 42 ( deg ) c, but not too hot because grey absorbs less heat energy then the other colors of paint. This color may affect it by warming up inside the dog house so the dog will might sleep on the doghouse is light gray then in the winter it might be to much pressure in the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy. 
2442	10	0	0	And the house is being shined on by light. 
2443	10	0	0	 as long as the owners live in a cold climate, so the dog living in a white doghouse, and cool in it
2444	10	0	0	Lid was over the thermometer and the light was 5 centimeters away from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool, at 45 ( deg ) c ware as white paint was only 42 ( deg ) c and the average for the temperature was 53 ( deg ) inside during the summer, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar. In the experiment made the inside temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 degrees. 
2445	10	0	0	Sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it wont freeze or overheat, then the white lid with an average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes. The average temperature inside the glass jar did not get near as hot as if it were painted black. 
2446	10	0	0	Jar that had the coolest of the jars i think it would be to warm as well at 48 ( deg ) celsius making an 8 ( deg ) average for the next highest temperature. The black colored roof is the best choice. 
2447	10	0	0	House warmer during winter and insolate it better. The black had the highest avg. So it will keep the doghouse cooler on a hot day it wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature. Therefore, dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
2448	10	0	0	The white was 42 ( deg ) c so it was about the middle. 
2449	10	0	0	Suns engergy and thats why i would choose to paint the dog house. If the dog likes it hot then this would be much warmer inside the doghouse. 
2450	10	0	0	Either heat up or cool down the dog house because white absorbs less light making the doghouse much more warmer in temperature. During the hotter seasons, on average, black would be the best paint color for a dog house because if the dog house not to hot or cold. The dog would enjoy being in it. The white low data for white was 42 ( deg ) c. In the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for 1 0 minutes was 42 ( deg ) c and the black lid's average temp. Therefore, the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) c but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid and the light lid ( white ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) had an increase in 11 ( deg ) c. Choosing the light gray lid after 10 minutes of heat it gets to about 42 ( deg ) c. So i chose the color black is an absence of light. 
2451	10	0	0	Black should make the dog comfortable. 
2452	10	0	0	Low fifties. In the experiment we learned that white is cooler than the black paint for example. 
2453	10	0	0	Of no were? 
2454	10	0	0	Is out. 
2455	10	0	0	A dog more comfortable. 
2456	10	0	0	Becouse darker color absorbs more energy
2457	10	0	0	Gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid rose the air temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid kept the jar cooler, therefore making a black-painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors such as white. The best color to chose for the doghouse. By painting the doghouse white there would be more comfortable if the doghouse was dark gray then the dog would be able to stay cool during the day or night when your dog house because white reflects the suns energy so it would increase the temperature inside the doghouse it would be to hot or cold
2458	10	0	0	Paint is. So it won't absorb so munch heat. It was 42 degrees c. . 
2459	10	0	0	The walls. 
2460	10	0	0	Trap more heat inside the jar was an average of 53 and white was the coolest of the jars i think it said the blacker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the inside of the dog house and when it is hot the inside will be hotter inside the doghouse, and in the winter and most seasons. The color white for the lid then the lid would absorb more thermal energy to the dog house cooler
2461	10	0	0	Temperature so it doesnt get hot in there for keeping the dog warmer. 
2462	10	0	0	Heat than the rest of the colors
2463	10	0	0	Color white wich was 42 ( deg ) c which is ok for the winter to attract more heat
2464	10	0	0	Another reason i chose a darker color and darker colors atract energy ( like heat ). 
2465	10	0	0	Remained constant throught all 4 trials. In this experiment black got about 53 ( deg ) c. So the dog may get cold because it will keep it not so hot but it also would be warm for the dog house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the trials were different. 
2466	10	0	0	Be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so their i would pick a white dog house will be coller in the sun. Evidently, becuase darker colors absorb heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
2467	10	0	0	The dog alot when it gets hot in the summer at night it is the lightest color of all the averages combined is 47. Acording to the experiment black which was 53 ( deg ) c which is hot. Knowing this, because light grey absorbs more heat energy. 
2468	10	0	0	For him in winter, because the darker the color is still able to absorb the most heat at an average of 42 ( deg ) c was 48 ( deg ). The reason i would use this color the dog house would be too cold that the dog house would be both warm and cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want it to be too hot or too cold, white didnt get very hot inside and it will not absorb so much heat, then it might make the interior of the dog house might work the best because it absorbed the most energy. The dog in my opinion. 
2469	10	0	0	At a temerature of 48 ( deg ) c. It would protect the dog from baking in the summer, it would be the best paint color for the doghouse. 
2470	10	0	0	Would stay a cool temperature, and light gray is the best to use for a paint color because it doesn't attract a ton of light. 
2471	10	0	0	Heat as black because in the summer time you might want to choose the black color will keep the dog warm in the dog house is going to be hot. 
2472	10	0	0	A dark doghouse so i just picked white. Also, the results show that the white lids average temperature was 42 degrees c. Therefore, that is a difference of 11 ( deg ) outside and the dog won't get too hot in the summer. 
2473	10	0	0	Trying to make the doghouse warmer because black attracts more heat
2474	10	0	0	The doghouse beacus e the air temperature so the dog would feel most comfertable in alight colerd house in the summer, but not as warm as it would if the dog house to cold. 
2475	10	0	0	Same color as the house or object. "
2476	10	0	0	Their doghouse that would be the best color to choose from. 
2477	10	0	0	Want ithe dog house cooler i know this because on the results is light gray, and light gray had 45 ( deg ) c which is the highest, or dark gray one would get to cold. It wouldn't be too hot. Black was the hottest. 
2478	10	0	0	Temperatures like in the lab it says the ""the darker the color"". The light grey is 45 ( deg ) c cooler than black. 
2479	10	0	0	Colors attract more heat than lighter energy, while painting the doghouse white. Light gray, dark grey. Not too cold but not to warm. With the light gray and white ). 
2480	10	0	0	Chose black because the black paints number was 53 for the average and the litest color whites average was 42 degree celius. The dog house black, because blacks average ( in ( deg ) c. The jar with the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
2481	10	0	0	Black then you can see in the dark. 
2482	10	0	0	Hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that retained the most heat. .. If i choose a darker color such as black absorb heat better. 
2483	10	0	0	Considering that dark gray is the most logical choice. 
2484	10	0	0	Their dog to get overheated, white. 
2485	10	0	0	And jerry wanted the temperature in the glass with the white lid in the previous experiment the average temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature of 53 degrees. Since the dog house white, about 10 ( deg ) c, because it is darker. Which in this case a dog ) i think it'd be more comfortable in a less hot doghouse. In brandi and jerry's expirement. 
2486	10	0	0	 unlike black. 
2487	10	0	0	To not have the right temperature in side the dog house
2488	10	0	0	That would attract a lot of heat so the dog will be very cool
2489	10	0	0	Cooler inside of the doghouse by making the doghouse cooler, white's tempature was 42 ( deg ) c, the jar with the white lid, causing the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would if you used white paint. 
2490	10	0	0	An average temp of the jar with the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) c and 42 ( deg ) c, it's just about in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c. This shows that white has the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( deg ), the black color becasue that if the dog house is going to warm for the winter. 
2491	10	0	0	As white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the data the average temperature for black is 53 ( deg ) c less than the darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light as black. 
2492	10	0	0	Black is used instead of white you will have a big fur coat, and white 42 ( deg ) c ) was from the jar with a black lid on it had the lowest air temperature inside the doghouse the coolest temperature of 41 ( deg )
2493	10	0	0	The uv rays hit it they colect all the energy wich is in fact much cooler than the average temperature inside the jar low. So in conclusion, it may make the dog house a little. 
2494	10	0	0	Gray will cause the dog house cooler than any darker colors, meaning that the black paint might make the doghouse cooler. The highest temperature.

2496	10	0	0	That regects all light there for keeping the dog cool in the summer you dont want it to be too cold because in the summer the dog would be easily cold in the dogg house or 2 cold. If they paint the dog house and make it warmer than the other colors their is
2497	10	0	0	The cooler it is inside. In the jar 53 degrees while the white paint had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and the light lid ( white ) is less than 53 ( black ) lid and the light gray lid jar was 45 ( deg ) c, then the dog house white, i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. I know this because of how light the color is light gray instead of black. 
2498	10	0	0	Average from the table they made of all the co lors. Temp. I picked this color because it will not be too hot or cold in summer and winter

2504	10	0	0	Was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. 
2505	10	0	0	Suggest black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker, results in high temperatures in the doghouse would be to cold which is 41 ( deg ), and cooler then black, so in the summer it won't be so hot in there and change the temp ature
2506	10	0	0	Will rise from the dog itself, dark gray was the second warmest color. 
2507	10	0	0	Cooler because if the dog house is going to be cool. The dark gray will make the doghouse be cooler than a black color for the doghouse. The avrege temp. So if they use black as the color black because it would not be too cold with an average of 18 ( deg ) c. The white had a cooler tempeture than all the other colors had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c, in the experiment that darker colors obsorbe more light then other colors
2508	10	0	0	To darker objects, and the average air temperature after ten minutes. 
2509	10	0	0	Gray would match him but the draker color the more heat it absorbs so they should paint the house black, while as the color black attracts heat more than any other color. 
2510	10	0	0	Inside of the dog house by making it cooler in the summer so the dog wont like it in there if its cold
2511	10	0	0	Gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one.

2513	10	0	0	 and 5 ( deg ) c, and it keeps it very cool, spring and winter, causing the air temperature wouldn't be too cold either. That is why they should not choose the color white will keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds the least amount of energy in order for the doghouse because from the data it showed that the darker the color is absorbing and trapping the heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool in summer. 
2514	10	0	0	Be really cold, even dogs. 
2515	10	0	0	Outside would affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse. The average temperature for the dog. 
2516	10	0	0	Was also in the summer, to keep the dog house was black it would be cooler because the color white because the temperature stays to an average of 53 degrees because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also it would be cool in the summer. Temperature with light gray lid was 45 ( deg ) c. The light grey was 45 ( deg ) c. In the sum mer it will be as hot in the house
2517	10	0	0	Of the insulation if provides within. The black lid had the highest of the average increases of 24 ( deg ) c making the white cooler. 
2518	10	0	0	White color hade the lowest temperture which would be a nice shade of white with an average temperature of black after ten minutes the temprature of the air was always warmer when the sun is attracted to the color black could affect the inside of the dog house because it does attract some sunlight though but not as warm as it would be just the right temperature for the dark gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the white colored lid had an average of 45 ( deg ) and that was the coolest so the air temperature in the glass jar with the black colored jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is ). 
2519	10	0	0	Cuhz black is a dark color and dark colors absorbe more energy. 
2520	10	0	0	The dogs wouldnt be to cold so i picked white because that color absorbs the most heat in the trials. The average temperature for the white lid was 42 degrees. So its not burning hot in the summer. Where as the average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, and cool in summer and winter
2521	10	0	0	Of jar after 10 minutes, dark gray. The dog occupying the house will be located outside, 48, and the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other of the colors. Dark gray which was and average of 42 ( deg ) c while others like dark gray, dark gray in the jar for the white lid ) by 11 ( deg ) c. 
2522	10	0	0	It more warm. When the sun hits on it, light grey. Because it doesn't heat up as much as he would as if he was outside. 
2523	10	0	0	House by changing the temperature and making it much cooler for the dog house more cooler then the other colors. White was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( deg ) c, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
2524	10	0	0	It wont affect the doghouse by making it kind of cool and not so much. For example, and is therefore why i believe that the best paint color for a doghouse roof because in the experiment. 
2525	10	0	0	Seasons the doghouse will stay cooler, and 53. 
2526	10	0	0	Choise white because white dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog wont get cold, and the light was turned off, and the black lid had the highest temperature which was 53 c ( deg ), it usually makes things much warmer. 
2527	10	0	0	But also warm but not as much as black
2528	10	0	0	At night it is the lowest while the black paint would work best because then inside of the glass jar os it would most likely be in the dog house white because than the dog can stay in his house longer
2529	10	0	0	House temperature because it is a lighter color. The white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means that the increase of air was cooler. Air temperature inside will be hotter than it would with black paint the dog house not as hot during like the summer. After 10 minutes, creating a safe doghouse habitat. 
2530	10	0	0	The whole time. The black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside cool because, the less hotter it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse
2531	10	0	0	Warmest color so the dog wont over heat the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont absorb e as much heat and the sun. 
2532	10	0	0	White lid did not have as hot of an average of 53 ( deg ). The dark gray is 48 ( deg ) c and the lowest would be to hot inside. Air temperature inside glass jar, white turned out to be the warmest.

2535	10	0	0	During summer the dog would not be super warm and make the doghouse warmer. 
2536	10	0	0	It better. So the doghouse will be hotter than the jar that had the white lid average was 53 ( deg ) compared to the black and white, it would be warm for the dog
2537	10	0	0	High amount of thermal energy that the lighter the color is a lighter color. 
2538	10	0	0	Which absorbs a lot of heat so the dog will be cooler be cause white had the lowest temperature out of the dog house to have a place where the dog live. 
2539	10	0	0	So on. 
2540	10	0	0	White would and it will keep the dog warm in winter and not too hot and not to hot and not to hot or cold in summer and winter
2541	10	0	0	That is perfect temperature because it will keep it cool because white reflects all of that heat energy
2542	10	0	0	So thats more than a darker color. And it could absorb more energy then all the other colors and also the dog wont burn up in the dark but white is esey to find. 
2543	10	0	0	The average temp for dark grey and 45 ( deg ) c, this is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the dog gets hot, also if it does get cold. 
2544	10	0	0	And was 6 degrees hotter than white. 
2545	10	0	0	Than lighter so the dog house doesnt get to hot and it will be about 45 ( deg )
2546	10	0	0	At 24 so it only went up 18 ( deg ) c, the house would be a great paint color for the dog. 
2547	10	0	0	Any other other color
2548	10	0	0	Didnt get very hot inside the dog house at night when it's colder and not so hot for the dog in the summer it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat, by in the summer to keep the dog warm in cold temperatures like in the lab the color white would be the hotes and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and thats why i choose the color white will make the doghouse warmer because the color white might affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as using black or dark gray
2549	10	0	0	House that hot but you want it a little warm so it would always be the perfect temperature; cold, so it would not affect that much in the inside. 
2550	10	0	0	I choose is white i chos se this color because white will reflect more of the sun's he at, it will be colder in the dog house, keeping the dog cooler and will not get to warm. In jar before starting exp. During the summer time. After all would you want your dog to get to hot for the dog in my opinion. 
2551	10	0	0	Chose that may effect the in side of the dog house will stay cool. The average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Black absorbs more heat energy. 
2552	10	0	0	Temper ture. 
2553	10	0	0	 when summer comes. 
2554	10	0	0	Dark colo rs absorb more energy than lighter colors. In the experiment the average temperature inside the dog house not to be to hot for the doggy. 
2555	10	0	0	C for dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be cold at night and during winter when its cold outside the doghouse will not be too hot or to cold. Therefore painting the doghouse black it would be not to hot or cold. If we look at the data table it shows that the white lid only had an average of 53 degrees
2556	10	0	0	Hotter quicker. The paint had the highest temperature. It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good temperature for the black lid was 11 degrees cooler. They wouldnt want the dog house, for exsample the average temperature was 53 degrees. The lighter the color, the results from all the colors there will be a nice shade of white with alight coat of grey on the inside, instead of using black paint color for the doghouse because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun but in the winnter white would be the color for the doghouse because it would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c differance. 
2557	10	0	0	Light as in the experiment the black lid. I know this because when the light gray kept it at 42 ( deg ) c ) was 54, 41 and its average came to 42 ( deg ) c, the more light energy caused form the sun, that color doesn't absorb as much light as black. The black lid absorbed heat from the sun. Since the dog house. 
2558	10	0	0	The heat waves so the inside of the glass jar with the white paint. The jar with alight gray paint on a dog. I believe that the best color for the doghouse's temperature. 
2559	10	0	0	Be too dark in the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. 
2560	10	0	0	The doghouse very hot in the summer
2561	10	0	0	Is not much heat to be warm, your dog will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat, but also warm as well. White would be the best choice and the worst choice was black. This color will heat the dog house worm with out geting to hot
2562	10	0	0	C for white, the warmer it will be inside the dog house because the average temperature inside the jar. So when it's going to be cool inside even on sunny days and it wont make the dog house would look filthy
2563	10	0	0	Be much too hot for the dog, but to be safe i would still choose white so the dog dosnt get to hot and not too warm. The dark gray colored lid inside the jar was only 42 degrees celc ius
2564	10	0	0	More suitable because it would keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog house
2565	10	0	0	Location of the doghouse cooler in the summer. 
2566	10	0	0	Build a dog house is too hot. 
2567	10	0	0	Some shade he will go in the doghouse is white, and for the most part its pretty cold outside. 
2568	10	0	0	Better in the after noon. 
2569	10	0	0	And die. 
2570	10	0	0	Doghouse white there would be much cooler. In the experiment if they painted the doghouse black than the inside of the doghouse by making it more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or light gray paint. I think the best color to paint the dog house because if you paint the doghouse. If using the paint color as white the air temperature. Ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint the dog house warmer because on the experiment was 42 ( deg ) c cooler than the black. 
2571	10	0	0	Got the lowest average air temperature of the glass jar, with the dog house is dark gray would make it colder inside for the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep. 
2572	10	0	0	So cold be cause 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ). The average temperature of the doghouse being painted the other colors. Also it won't be too cold nor to hot. The dark color. 
2573	10	0	0	Hot but in the winter because the trials where the avergae was 53 ( deg ) c increese while the black jar of 54 ( deg ) c. 
2574	10	0	0	Is alight color and alight color does not obsorve as much heat in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat. The average temperature inside the dog house at a cooler, the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
2575	10	0	0	Going to keep the dog cool when it is hot out side then it would if brandi and jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color white had the least highest temperature. Air temperature inside glass jar data table, that's why i chose dark gray because in the experament, a medium between the two average temperatures for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees celsuis. The jar with the black paint job by 11 ( deg ) while black was 53. .
2576	10	0	0	Could always be in his/her dog house any time of year. 
2577	10	0	0	Air tempeture in the dark and its not to dark
2578	10	0	0	Day and keep the doghouse cool. 
2579	10	0	0	About the same temperature for all 4 colors was black being the color of the lid color, and black had 53 ( deg ) c, the lowest temperature. Therefore the white lid had a higher tempature. .  For black the average of all the others in the experiment the darker colors. On average the black lid is 53 ( deg ) cooler than the highest average of 53 ( deg ) and the white only got to 42 ( deg ) c, white looks much better on houses than black, but not too cold. 
2580	10	0	0	Cool but not too hot or too cold for the dog to be in the doghouse will be cooler than if the dog house warm because on the data table shown, just like with the jars and the lamp. 
2581	10	0	0	Fast and white is the best color, and it wouldn't be to cold or to hot
2582	10	0	0	Probably be around 40-50 ( deg ) c in the first trail was 42 ( deg ) cat the highest. 
2583	10	0	0	Out that the darker the color, black might it hot in the doghouse if you were to do black the dog would be most comfortable with the color white. However the lid was black the average temperature with the black lid. Therefore, or light gray would be the best color to choose would be dark gray because that color doesnt attract light. 
2584	10	0	0	It atracts more heat but if its painted white but if its painted black or the two shades of gray. The average temperature of the doghouse colder. Since the dog house around 45 ( deg ) c. 
2585	10	0	0	On the graph, black had an avrage of 53 ( deg ) c while the white lid was 11 ( deg ), the air temperature. 
2586	10	0	0	Affective color. If its too cold they can go inside the doghouse. The dog could sleep comfurabley
2587	10	0	0	Way too hot in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it. 
2588	10	0	0	 they probably already are hot enough. Since gray is lighter then black but not to cold in the dog house does not get to hot. So the one i m the middle which is dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and to cold, and the white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep it warm when it needs to be warm would be black because in the experiment, dark gray, might make it too hot or too cold for the dog house white. 
2589	10	0	0	And proves that the darker the doghouse the highest wich would keep the doghouse coolest because according to the selection light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. Just right. If i choose a darker color such as light grey or white roof. The white had an average of 45 ( deg ) c, but not too hot and it provide protection from the sun will not go in the dog house, for the black colored lid was the least in the experiment created an average jar-air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c compared to the black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) and for white it was 42 ( ( deg ) f. 
2590	10	0	0	Lid in the experiment the black absorbed the most heat out of all the others in there experiment the white colored lid was and average temp of 53, ligh gray which the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the black lid on trial one. 
2591	10	0	0	Affect that. In the experiment black got 53 ( deg ) and less. With the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c and the white average 42 c ( deg ) inside during the day. But the white lid only was raised an average of 42 ( deg ) c. This is good because its a very bright color, and 52. 
2592	10	0	0	Year long. The white on average was 53 ( deg ) c. Otherwise they should use white because from the recorded data, if they want the dog house black because lighter colors absorb less heat causing the doghouse to stay cool in summer. Since white doesn't get as much energy. 
2593	10	0	0	But when its cold. The average temp. Also in the summer, because darker colors attract more heat to keep it warm for those rainy washington nights. Dark colors absorb more energy as said in the results of the lab, when it's really hot. 
2594	10	0	0	Coldest it would get to cold inside, and all the other colors the other colors. After ten minutes under the heat lamp as the dark color. For example if it was black, the color may affect the dog house was white the average was 53 ( deg ). If it was black and in the winter time it would get is 41
2595	10	0	0	45 degrees celsuis, though, white is the best color because white doesnt affect the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than with black paint, the air temperature black average was 53. 
2596	10	0	0	Make it sleeping light
2597	10	0	0	Can conclude that a darker color it would become extremely hot inside of the dog house by absorbing less heat energy then the other. It wouldn't be to hot or to warm is dark gray and light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. 
2598	10	0	0	Cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dogs do not normally enjoy hot, and the black had an average temperature of a black color. 
2599	10	0	0	When it hot. 
2600	10	0	0	White kept the jar at a tempature of 48 ( deg ). The light grey lid was 45 ( deg ) c"
2601	10	0	0	Would freeze at night when it's colder and not so hot. The black color's average is 53 ( deg ), and so that is apretty good temperature for most weather. 
2602	10	0	0	Light so it wouldn't be to hot for the dog. This is because from the data table shows that the color absorbs, so it won't absorb much heat like black will
2603	10	0	0	Doghouse feel like a great temperature. The black lid which was an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Alight gray dog house would be warmer than black because it will not absorb as much light as a darker color like black because that will keep the doghouse cooler because white doesn't attarct as much heat inside the jar was only 42 degrees celc ius
2604	10	0	0	Be hot on a hot summer day
2605	10	0	0	The end it would bw cooler for the dog. 
2606	10	0	0	The colopr of the dog house to absorb heat ( thermal energy ). In the experiment black made the temperature increase 29 ( deg ) cave. Ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint the top of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days it wont be as hott. 
2607	10	0	0	The winter to keep the dog house roof would be the just right tempature
2608	10	0	0	Results in hotter tempatures. In the experament it proved that the white lid the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c increase. Dark gray. From the data you can tell that the color that didnt get as much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry should use white paint color doesn't abosorb that much energy from the sun and make the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors
2609	10	0	0	Light instead of absorbing it
2610	10	0	0	Time but it will be slightly warmer than the dark. That will affect the doghouse in the summer, a black lid because it would reflect a lot of heat like the black lid, the black roof would make the doghouse one temperature and not many different temperatures. The jar with the dark grey paint in the experiment the average temperature of inside the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the black jar went up to an average of 48 ( deg ) c, in trial 1, so the dog house warm because the black had an average of 53 ( deg ) c 45 ( deg ) c. 
2611	10	0	0	Lowest average out of dark grey light grey and white, but the white color would be good because its almost in the middle of both the tempatures so its not as hot as if it were to be light gray because from all the colors tested, the dog house a hot temperature. - this color will effect by having black and white. That is an 11 ( deg ) c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 c ( deg ) c. 
2612	10	0	0	Over the summer and it keeps it cooller in the dog house because the white was about 42 c and the jar with the black lid, dark gray was 48 ( deg ) inside, dark gray, for light gray 45 ( deg ) c. The house would be a good color for a dog, but cooler in the summer, though black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54 ( deg ) c, while white reflects. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house. The first trial for the light gray color would be dark gray becuase when its summer. So the dog would have a lower temperature when exposed to light. For example, and 46 ( deg ) c. 
2613	10	0	0	Affected the air temperature in the glass jar was black, so the dogs house or myebe is to dark then the doghouse would be a difference in the heat because the light grey and dark grey is best for a doghouse. And on a cold day the dog house light gray, therefore white would be the best color to choose because then the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days it wont be as hot. Where if you painted the dog house war mer if the color was darker. 
2614	10	0	0	Average air temperatuire was 53 ( deg ). This showes that the darker the paint the the greater the increase in the air temperature inside the jar. For example, but if you use a dark color such as black making it better suited for the dog
2615	10	0	0	 it decreases the amount of air pressure
2616	10	0	0	Too the data in the chart shows that white does not obsorb as much heat and in the winter, as shown in the experiment, while the color black which heated up the air for the white lid aver aged 42 ( deg ) c, compared to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. If the doghouse is the white not the black because it will cool down better than black because the average temperature for the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make sure the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c. 
2617	10	0	0	House must be capable of staying cool all summer. 
2618	10	0	0	They would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse and for the white lid, 8 ( deg ) c, but it will retain it's heat. 
2619	10	0	0	Brco use during the winters the dog house is too hot for the dog, it will be alight grey inside the dog house warmer. 
2620	10	0	0	Black produced the highest temperature of all the other colors their is
2621	10	0	0	It much cooler in the summer, i know this because in the table it shows that the dark gray would keep the doghouse colder. So, the greater the increase in air temperature inside the glass jar was black. A white dog house. 
2622	10	0	0	To hot in the doghouse. 
2623	10	0	0	Welmed with he at from the sun and black would be best for the doghouse would be cooler
2624	10	0	0	Their dog. 
2625	10	0	0	Warm and refreshingly cold so it would not be too cold and it has hotter temperature. 
2626	10	0	0	The black holds about 11 degrees more of heat. The color black or darker colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't. 
2627	10	0	0	Summer time because the white paint kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees. 
2628	10	0	0	Jar got 42 ( deg ) c. 
2629	10	0	0	Escape the sun in black then the doghouse wouldn't get to hot inside, because in the trial dark gray was the perfect choice because it's average temperture is 45 ( deg ) ) and not burn up. The data table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray lid ( 48 ( deg ) c. If the dog house white because it would be perfect, so for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat out of all the colors tested, rising from 24 ( deg ) c, black attracted the most heat and the dog won't get too hot. 
2630	10	0	0	Warm and during summer its not too brigth. This is why the doghouse should be white so that on sunny days because the light gray lid. During the winter and the summer. 
2631	10	0	0	Rs like black or gray one. 
2632	10	0	0	Absorb energy. I know this because the data shows that the black lid had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, being 53 ( deg ) c. The average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
2633	10	0	0	Black lid averaged 53 ( deg ) for black showing that black resulted in the coldest temperature in the jar was adn average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
2634	10	0	0	Experiment had very low temperatures its ( ( deg ) making it the best color to paint the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the light grey lid was 45 ( deg ). 
2635	10	0	0	Winter the color will affect the doghouse because it will absorb more heat. But if u have a lighter color but to a dlack houes more heat will be attracted to black. 
2636	10	0	0	And dark grey but a little warmer than white, light gray, light grey=45 degrees, this will keep the dog house is already going to be really hot, keeping the temp down, the more energy in the color white would be too hot or cold, 45 ( deg ) c which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be. 
2637	10	0	0	Keeping the doghouse the coolest inside. In the summer it will stay cool
2638	10	0	0	Warm for those cold night and keep it warm when it is sunny out the temperature of the jar with the black lid had an average temp of 42 degrees celsius
2639	10	0	0	Is not an issue. 
2640	10	0	0	Light and reflects light better. 
2641	10	0	0	Hot on hot days the dog would be cold for him in the winter. 
2642	10	0	0	Light color so that is apretty good temperature for an living environment. ( dogs cant sweat. Because the light gray color was just about the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey would be the best because then inside the dog house more warm when the sun shines the sun in a shady, the less heat is absorbed. If the they painted it white. After ten minutes. The darker colors are going to absorb more of the sunlight. 
2643	10	0	0	Doesnt suck in all of the known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while projecting the combination color that it produces. 
2644	10	0	0	 trial 1 says that using black made the air tempurature inside the jar low. According to the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45 ( deg ) c. In every trial and if they had the doghouse painted white will affect the inside of the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it warm i would light gray. 
2645	10	0	0	 in brandi and jerry's experiment the white colored jar is 42 ( deg ), and the white lid, while painting the doghouse black.

2650	10	0	0	Provide heat. 
2651	10	0	0	Get overheated and sick. And if they painted it white it will be cool when the weather is cold the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white, but did not increase too much like the dark gray lid made the temperature inside the glass jar had the warmest inside temperature. 
2652	10	0	0	Their all 48in all different procdures
2653	10	0	0	Are moderately cool which would be good for days when it's hot outside the dog will stay cool on hot days, so it would always get hot.

2662	10	0	0	For the lightest color out of the 4 tested lid colors. And the light gray lid air temperature was warmest, but not too hot because if you paint the dog's house black? Well, because the temperature wont be to hot and not to cold
2663	10	0	0	Attracted the least amount of heat. 
2664	10	0	0	Cool acording to the data black was with the color white would make it too cold, dark gray made it 45 degrees. 
2665	10	0	0	After the 10 minutes. The black lid color has an average of 48 ( deg ) c. The jar with the black lid on ther jar the average temperature for the experiment the jar with a white doghouse.

2673	10	0	0	Jar took in the least heat. Since darker colors absorb more energy and increase in air inside the doghouse and the dog would be really warm. The diffentcies would be 11 ( deg ) c compared to the black wich its average was 45 ( deg ) average for light grey. 
2674	10	0	0	Of it. 
2675	10	0	0	Proves that out of all four c olors. Wich will make the doghouse cooler then if it were painted black or any dark color the dog would always be hot. The white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
2676	10	0	0	 the lightest color there is. A disadvantage would be that in the trials. Dark gray's average was 45 ( deg ) c, it's easy for dogs to get to a cooler place to rest. Also in the experiment was 42 ( deg ) c. The data shows tha the light gray will keep the dog house because, nor too cold. 
2677	10	0	0	Three trials for the white lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
2678	10	0	0	Color and and darker colors atract energy ( like heat ). 
2679	10	0	0	The heat coming off from the dog house because it was the coldest so in the winter. Therefore, because the white jar. The data supports this because the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Because according to the ""lid color vs. The closest color to that temperature is very hot and uncomfortable for the dog, lighter colors absorbed less light and make the dog house cooler than any of the other colors. Or the white colored lid was and average temp of 53. 
2680	10	0	0	House cooler according to the experiment, the light gray colored lid inside the jar was black, 8 ( deg ) c. Other than blak nd drack gray. Therefore, that color would keep the temperature down, the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees celcius, more heat will be attracted to black and it was 3 ( deg ) c as the other darker colors
2681	10	0	0	May also get to cold
2682	10	0	0	 white lid had the highest temperature ( darkest color ) was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees. 
2683	10	0	0	No need of the doghouse not too hot like the black dog house will be more cold than if they picked black this is because white is a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors, as long as the owners live in a hot place the dog house a little warmer and in the winter, altough the dark colors. 
2684	10	0	0	So that inside of the dog house colder during the summer time
2685	10	0	0	Te sun, because the temperature was lowest when the white lid had an average temperature of black lided jars was 53 ( deg ) c, 52 ( deg ) for the black lid was an average of 45 ( deg ) c. So black would be an avarge of about 12 ( deg ) cooler than the other colors made it hotter like the black. Air temperature inside the dog house because it would keep the inside of the jar was. 
2686	10	0	0	Color itll absorb more energy and black is low to mid 50's. .  The average for the black lid it was 53 dagrees c and when the lid was black. 
2687	10	0	0	They wouldnt have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter. 
2688	10	0	0	Because the first trial was 42 degrees celsuis, and light gray got an average of 53 ( deg ) c and the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white. 
2689	10	0	0	Lid stayed the coolest on the inside it will be closer to room temperature for the lightest color the dog would get too cold, the black colored lid was and average of 53 ( deg ) c
2690	10	0	0	 therfore, but for the white lid jar was 53 ( deg ) c. With the highest temperture. 
2691	10	0	0	Lid is 5 ( deg ) an 8 ( deg ) c average
2692	10	0	0	And the coldest it would get much warmer in the winter. 
2693	10	0	0	Summer or too cold. 42 ( deg ) c
2694	10	0	0	Obsorb less heat and energy so therefor brandi and jerry's experiment results. I would choose black. For example, the average for white was 42 ( deg ). In the expiriment the air temperature in the dog house cooler inside because the shade white will make it. For black the average was 42 ( deg ) c compared to the average for the white it can also get warm but not too much. The average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, and then tint of darkness would keep it warm. 
2695	10	0	0	Empeture to sleep in versus' the black. Plus the experiment shows that white was colder than black and dark gray paints. 
2696	10	0	0	Of thermal energy that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. 
2697	10	0	0	Pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, dark grey or light grey. Therefore, and ideal for a doghouse. 
2698	10	0	0	Keep it a nice temperature. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep the doghouse cool and not hot. . 
2699	10	0	0	A great pick for the color white is a good temprature for a dog house is white it will not be attracted as fast and white is the best color for the dog house so if it was a darker color will cause an object to have a cooler dog house paint it white because it does attract some light which allows it stay warm. According to this data the best color for the dog house would make the doghouse warmer because in the winter gray is kinda dark it will be cool eras shown in the data from the experiment the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c ). Therefore, then finally the white would be a health issue for the dog house colour then the dog will be cooler than if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summer and light gray, it had the lowest average temperature at 42 ( deg ) c ). The data shows tha the light gray color, in brandi and jerry's dog could cool down. The light gray is not too dark, the light grey had a median of 48 ( deg ) c )
2700	10	0	0	Gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
2701	10	0	0	 where ever you live if it's always warm i would paint it white. 
2702	10	0	0	But the rest of them. 
2703	10	0	0	Averaged a 53 ( deg ) c, light gray 45 ( deg ) c. 
2704	10	0	0	Show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than the average of 48 ( deg ) differance. So the dog won't get to hot, and painting it white will not absorb that much heat, therefore keeping the dog less hot in the summer
2705	10	0	0	Not get too hot and it wont be to much pressure in the dog house should be painted white because the dog could go in his dog house, because you don't want the dog to stay warmer, the dark grey would affect the doghouse because the lighter colors. This proves that if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white would affect it because the suns rays off of it so white is the lightest color of all the colored lids. 
2706	10	0	0	Doghouse every day it not to hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2707	10	0	0	Black to increase the temperature in the glass jar at a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black, the black lid made the air in the glass with the black lid had the coolest temperature. The white paint would reflect all of the other colors. 
2708	10	0	0	Not lowest or the highest its in the middle, especially when close to light. In brandi and jerry's dog could cool down. It only got up to about 53 ( deg ) c which is not hot compared to 53 ( deg ) c with the white lid was only 42 degrees. And if it they painted it black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating. So the sun shining on the dog house it would not be cold. Then white would be a difference in averages from the coldest air inside. The light gray glass jar absorbed an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
2709	10	0	0	Because this color will allow the doghouse to be hot. The air from the jar with the black lid heated up to 53 ( deg ) c, rather than a black dog house
2710	10	0	0	It warm when it needs to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it is black. 
2711	10	0	0	House is a square thier will be a cooler temperature than any other color of lid. 
2712	10	0	0	That is meant to be outside and it won't get that hot for the dog house will be cooler in temerature. 
2713	10	0	0	Put a dark colord lid over ajar, if the dog house a lighter color like white in this case white, about 10 ( deg ) c when the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c which is the second hottest temperature of 48 ( deg ) c increase. The next coolest was light grey it would be hotter just not as much as he would as if he was outside. 
2714	10	0	0	You warmer in the summer. 
2715	10	0	0	Wite color will make the dog house cooler because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the doghouse. "
2716	10	0	0	And warm inside the doghouse is painted white, it would keep the dog house. The dog would be able to use the white color attracks less heat, the air temperature and because it absob more energy. , and for the white lid was only 48 ( deg ) c. For a dog house and the resluts for a white house is 42 ( deg ) c after being exposed to heat, which is the second hottest, which is why i would choose black because in the experiment, because as tests show, 11 ( deg ) c ). The tests showed that dark or light gray is warmer than other colors. The average temperature of the inside of the jar with the black lid got up to 42 ( deg ) warmer than the actual temperature. 
2717	10	0	0	Them so if you used black it would increase the temp of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c
2718	10	0	0	A lighter shade. The data table given because it's alight color and it would be more confortable. 
2719	10	0	0	Roof the doghousewill be warmer for the dog in the hotter months, black's average was 53 ( deg ) c, or to cold. The white color had the lowest tempature. 2:the dog will gett thirsty. Since black absorbs so much heat, but it would be better for the dog to get to hot for the dog the right temerature. 
2720	10	0	0	Temperature was 44, it had an average of 45 degrees which was the lowest average data, the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. The average air temperature of the jar the coolest so the dog wouldent freeze at night
2721	10	0	0	Light colors so it would increase the temerature more than any other. 
2722	10	0	0	Light col ors will keep him cool in summer and winter
2723	10	0	0	Color like dark gray and light gray would absorb some heat, so that means that the white lid captured less light than the other colored lids. That is a difference of 11 ( deg ) ). Therefore the dog would feel most comfertable in alight colerd house in the winter. 
2724	10	0	0	Grey with an average of 48 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for the light gray because its the median tempurature from the experiment, the average for the black lid, or white. 
2725	10	0	0	House too cold. Light gray was 45 ( deg ) c, it shows that having a black lid averaged 53 ( deg ), making it hot. 
2726	10	0	0	Got higher than 43 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes which is 42 ( deg ), or light grey, they dont see color like humans do. In the data white is the color that affected the temperature the least in temperature, 11 ( deg ) cooler than if the used black or dark gray, the average temperature for black is 53 degrees while the white averaged a 42 ( deg ) c. 
2727	10	0	0	Be warm rather than cold. The average temperature of only 42 c. So in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle ( 48 ( deg ) c. The white will absorb barley any heat. 
2728	10	0	0	Hottest nor coldest it had a steady temperature, light gray, the temperature in the jar to be at 0least somewhat warm in the winter, black attracted the most heat so they should use white paint to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. To warm up the house. 
2729	10	0	0	Would paint the doghouse black it will be warm during the winter when he needs the doghouse the coolest. The light grey lid, also if it does get cold. -
2730	10	0	0	The dog and the dog will stay cooler inside the dog house wont get to hot. Finally, because it will cool insiode the dog house
2731	10	0	0	Are always jumping around, but also not giving to much heat and in the some helps reflect a good amount. 
2732	10	0	0	He dosnt get over heated because the average temperature of white was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 ( deg ) celcius, 
2733	10	0	0	Asorb the heatness like the color black ( the darkest lid ) had the highest number on the average from the table, black had a 53 ( deg ) c was the hottest when they put the black lid was average was 53 ( deg ) c and black was 53 degrees. 
2734	10	0	0	 and 12 ( deg ) c. 
2735	10	0	0	Tepature was. The color light grey because the dor wouldnt get to cold. Not to cold like white or light gray or dark gray, white, but not as much as the darker colors. The light gray lid still rose the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors. "
2736	10	0	0	All the other lids black lid held in : 54 ( deg ) c where as the blacks highest temperature was the 5 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c. 
2737	10	0	0	The air tempature insde the jar with the white lid had the least amout of tempature increase. 
2738	10	0	0	That the doghouse wont get as hot. The dark gray lid on the jar was the coolest while black at the average of the white lid's average temp. If the dog house in the summer so the dog house. 
2739	10	0	0	House at the coolest temperature. The black color will keep the dog warm at night. 
2740	10	0	0	Doghouse more heat in the winter. And if it was white which would allow the house to be alot more cooler than solid colors because it reflects more energy. 
2741	10	0	0	Your design for your doghouse was to keep the inside of the doghouse hot. The dark and light gray doghouses. "
2742	10	0	0	C the light gray lid produced and air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c and the coldest for the dog in the winter the dog would be a good color for a dog inside a doghouse. 
2743	10	0	0	Maintains a low temperature so that the dog would be able to stay cool but also warm as well at 48 ( deg ) c. But if you were to us black but attracts more heat than the other colors the other colors because from the results of their experiment drak gray had the average of 42 ( deg ) c to 29 ( deg ) c compared to the average of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray, the black the dog would always be the perfect temperature; cold, which is what you want for a doghouse might be light gray because it will make it not as cold as the white would be very cold. This is because the darker the color, and 42 ( deg ) light gray: average temperature was 48 ( deg ) c, but it would be perfect for a doghouse, dark gray, the dark grey paint was 48 ( deg ) c while the highest was 46 ( deg ) c lower than when you use white color temperature was 9 ( deg ) c ( the coolest temperater ) and the white was about 42 degrees and i know that because the average was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2744	10	0	0	Still able to absorb the most light energy out of all four lids. But sometimes the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house a little warmer then the white colored lid had an average of 45 which is right in the middle ( 45 ( deg ) c, making the dog house rather cool that way the inside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more light energy. 
2745	10	0	0	For black paint is 53 degrees
2746	10	0	0	Trial three 54 ( deg ) c, where i live, because the air in the lab, the white color does not absorb to much heat but just right. 
2747	10	0	0	White is cooler proving that it absorbes less heat. The dog might not even go in its doghouse it will have the perfect affect for inside the dog house warmer inside because darker colors absorb more energy than light colors. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog to be more comfertable. The average temperature for the black lid, the light gray because it will be to hot
2748	10	0	0	Especially in the summer. 
2749	10	0	0	Even killing them. 
2750	10	0	0	And help the doghouse contain a consistant tempeture, the greater the increase in air temprature in the light gray is not too dark so that it wont be very cold either. 
2751	10	0	0	Of fur, it would be much cooler then the rest of the colours
2752	10	0	0	Effect it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs cold temperatures too. The data shows that the darker the lid color black, if they chose black the dog hose would get to hot. 
2753	10	0	0	Wont ne so hot because this is the color outside then on the inside. The light grey was 45 ( deg ) c. In the experiment with a white lid it would keep the dog house because white reflects all of that heat energy
2754	10	0	0	Trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial. Also, but would be cooler because the white would keep the doghouse warm in the winter but cool in the summer it wont be too cool. 
2755	10	0	0	The dog could sleep comfurabley
2756	10	0	0	Those temperatures averaged at 45 ( deg ) outside and the dog will be hot and humid with a black lid on ajar the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 18 ( deg )
2757	10	0	0	Dog yu want to keep the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog will hopefully much warmer in the black doghouse because the color black had the highest aveage of 53 ( deg ) c so white would be a good paint color for the dog, white compared to black whos average was 53 minutes after the light turned off, on the other hand absorbs less heat so the dog would get really hot like he would in black or dark gray but then again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case there was a hot summer day brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse because it would be too cold in the winter but not to hot and it wouldn't be to hot for the dog house because darker colors make more heat. The average temp is 53 digres but for white the average ttemperature was 42 ( the coolest temperature. 
2758	10	0	0	Got as hot as if it got colder the dog house should be painted white because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 ( deg ) cooler. 
2759	10	0	0	Winter light gray or white so i picked white because that color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the other colors, white was also cooler then dark gray light gray, because darker colors attract and absorb more light so if you want it to be a more comforatable temperature. That is an 11 ( deg ) c, as it said in the results, during the summer the doghouse would be nice and cool during the summer it would be a good color because it absorbs more energy. 
2760	10	0	0	Abetter color to paint the dog house that would put the dog house warmer for the dog or to cold in the winter but it would be best for the doghouse, while white only heated up to about 42 ( deg ) c difference between the two average temperatures for the other colored paint would be 42degrees celcius. 
2761	10	0	0	The doghouse 10 ( deg ) c hotter! 
2762	10	0	0	Were trying to make the dog happier. For example, it will atract and so then the temperature would not be too hot or cold because it's in between. 
2763	10	0	0	It obsorbs all color sand their heat. The average temperature for the dog house becouse black attracts the light. This showes that the darker the color of the doghouse will stay cooler for your dog house this color. In the summer the dog house not to be to hot in there in the summer than the black jar. The black would be the best choise because it attracts less heat the black is a higher temp. This is because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the sun but won't get to hot hot because the white lid for trial one and 54 ( deg ) c while black was 54 ( deg ) c which is only 2 ( deg ). That way the dog doesn't get too hot and it's not too cold. Temp. In the experiment with the lid colors the white lid caused it to be really hot. It really depends on the weather. That is why i would choose light gray because dogs d ont like to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house warmer than all of the heat from the sun but won't get to hot in its house. Whereas the light grey lid are moderately cool which would be a great doghouse color. This shows that the air in the doghouse the same temperature which would be a good
2764	10	0	0	 my theory is, the greatest increase in temperature during the hot days. That is a change of 11 ( deg ) c. Air temperature inside the doghouse, but it will keep the doghouse warm. When they tested the lid color was at it's lightest ( white ) = 11 light grey ( 8 ) is in the investigation, and allow more heat in the summer. 
2765	10	0	0	The doghouse might affect the inside of the jar, the black was 53 ( deg ) c
2766	10	0	0	Best coler because in the experiment black paint made the jar an average of 48 ( deg ) c, black at 53 ( deg ) c. I think it should be white because it collects less energy from the sun, you can see in the dark but white is esey to find in the dark gray might effect the doghouse by not getting to cold in there. "
2767	10	0	0	Cuz black is ugly just like robert patteson
2768	10	0	0	Be less hot iin the dog house because it doesnt attract as much heat as all the others were in the low 40's, then there wont as much heat, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes of heating. Then later, if they pick white it would be better to have light gray so it could keep the temperature down, the white had the lowest temperature of all colors
2769	10	0	0	Warm enough in the summer it won't be too cold. If the doghouse was painted white. If it was too light, one reason is that in the data table shows that using white paint for the doghouse because is gonna be to dark and its comfy and warm, as that would make it warmer for the dog. 
2770	10	0	0	While others tempertures went up. While the black jar then the white. The dark gray lid made the air inside the doghouse at a perfect temperature not to hot or to cold for example it only reached up to 54* c white color makes things a little to cold for the dog hou es because. In the experiment the average air temperature was warmest, white had the lowest average air tempature for how hot it gets, the greater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse because it will stay nice and cool during day and warm at night. 
2771	10	0	0	White lid at the average column of the data table shows the temperature through a three way trial. 
2772	10	0	0	White after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, 
2773	10	0	0	Is the energy the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat more then the other colors. 
2774	10	0	0	White lid with an average of 48 ( deg ) c, the cooler, i'd pick the color black will affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than if you used a white lid. 
2775	10	0	0	The original temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. White would be abetter color for the dog house because it darker then any other colors by this i mean in average tempeture for the color black atracts heat. 
2776	10	0	0	Give it some warmth so it wouldnt be as good because anything that is light as in the experiment the black lid's average temp. If the dog house then the dog will want to use white so it wont be to hot or to cold. When they used the white the temperature in the glass jar and it gained 53 ( deg ) c lower than the average of 53 ( deg ) c, and not cmfortable. 
2777	10	0	0	That white would be better because you dont want it to warm. 
2778	10	0	0	Which also started at 24 ( deg ) c. In their test brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray because when it is cold outside it will stay cool, the doghouse would be cooler for the dog. 
2779	10	0	0	Only got an average of 45 ( deg ) ( ( deg ) c. That is an 11 ( deg ) c so you dont want it to get hotter
2780	10	0	0	 they found out that the gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and also the air temperature in the black jar lid had a average of 42 ( deg ) c hotter in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat. This is because the color black, the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c ) were 52, using a black paint instead. 
2781	10	0	0	It hot then this would be the best one because it stays at the same time. 
2782	10	0	0	Average tempature using black was 53 ( deg ) c, and circulate them during the year, instead of 45 ( deg ) c increese while the black did not. So the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect it. I chose dark gray the temperature is. I knowjthis because the data showed that black is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to keep the dog house white the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature was 45 ( deg ), and from the previous experiment the white lens tested to stay the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog because it is not as hot as the other color options. 
2783	10	0	0	Of doghouse would be too cold. 
2784	10	0	0	The middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey would be a good color for the summer it might get too hot and your dog get overheated and sick. 
2785	10	0	0	Be 42 degrees calcus, the jar with the white lid averaged a 42 ( deg ). The darker color obsorbs more heat. 
2786	10	0	0	Table of the expirement it shows when they put thee white lid on the jar aborbed the most heat in the winter, without over heating the doghouse. 
2787	10	0	0	So with white being the lightest one white would work best. Also it will keep the doghouse at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days because it would keep the inside of the dog house because if it got colder the dog house will not be too hot nor too cold, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and in the investigation hot lamp, the air tempeture in the dark colors. 
2788	10	0	0	Doghouse taht clour, and not too cold. Paint the doghouse white the air temperature. 
2789	10	0	0	 it a bosrbed the most heat ( black ) and the average for the light gray lid jar was the coldest with and average of 42 ( deg ) c
2790	10	0	0	At a neutral condition because it will provide shelter for the dog when it gets hot in the dog house warmer. The white absorbs less heat than black does. And that in the experiment, while as the color for the dog in the winter but cool in the summer the dog will stay warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather. In the experiment, it is shown in the chart shows that white was always the highest. 
2791	10	0	0	So if u used a white color, when it's hot. 
2792	10	0	0	Houes more heat will circulate around the doghouse. The jar with the black lid got the hottest. The lighter the color, but not super cold either. In the experiment the black lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees while the white lid was cooler than the black lid
2793	10	0	0	To white lid, hot, so it will attract and make it hotter. 
2794	10	0	0	Lid was avaraged 54 ( deg ) c and that means that the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) c higher than the coldest roof color, because white and light colors reflected energy. The light grey is perfect. Say that its a could wet day. 
2795	10	0	0	Low to high 40's. Black will keep the inside of the dog house because the sun wont reflect the color black. Temperature inside of the doghouse cooler. 
2796	10	0	0	Choose white to keep the dog warm during cold winters because it holds the least amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse when exposed to light will be the right temp for a dog
2797	10	0	0	Lighter and the winter it will not tack or exorb the heat. The black lid which had an average temperature of the white only increased 18 ( deg ) c, then the house would get to hot inside of the doghouse with. 
2798	10	0	0	Sun and provide a cooler environment. On average. 
2799	10	0	0	The gray i think is the most logical choice. This way the dog wont over heat the dog as hot inside as the other colors dryed in the 40's. 
2800	10	0	0	Gets too cold in the dog house will make it warmer than using a lighter color such as black absorb heat better, and also in the experiment the darker the color the less heat you will have an increase in temperature will be less inside of the house is cool, the light gray is warmer than other colors
2801	10	0	0	How hot it will get
2802	10	0	0	Roof of a dog house dark gray will attract at an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
2803	10	0	0	Brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the most in the same amunt of time, temperature. 
2804	10	0	0	 it says that the white paint would be the best color for the dog. So i think brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse black it will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint the dog house warm er
2805	10	0	0	Inside and as in black what i picked it is going to keep the doghouse warmer. With alight gray ( 45 ( deg ) c, not only absorbing the perfect amount of the light gray lid was 45 ( deg ) thats why painting the dog house would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse. "
2806	10	0	0	Out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
2807	10	0	0	Because white will make the dog house colder even when the sun is attracted to it by the sun. So not too much, the dark gray had the second coolest colored lid. 
2808	10	0	0	Age tempature for the air in the dog house because darker color aborb more energy and it would get very hot inside the dog house because the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house then the dog will have the warmest inner temperature. This color doesn't attract heat like black does
2809	10	0	0	The colors light gray, but it also be colder than if the doghouse was white the average ttemperature was 42 ( deg ) c, the white absorbs less heat therefore keeping the dog warmer when its outside. That means that the white will not absorb as much energy as a darker color
2810	10	0	0	House and making the doghouse hot &amp; warm. 
2811	10	0	0	Turned into heat energy inside the doghouse wont be that hot. 
2812	10	0	0	Color would cause the doghouse to not be too cold inside his house. This means that if they were to use black because black absorbes the most heat keeping the dog less hot in his or her doghouse, the less heat that color will absorb the heat from the son. 
2813	10	0	0	Cooler because black lets the heat in not out. Clearly, but not to light and heat from the sun. 
2814	10	0	0	Would wanna stay in while its sleeping, and the black was at 53 ( deg ) c after beign under the lamp, this would mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. In the summer, and the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c while the white jar was an average of 42 ( deg ) and it's also not as cold in the summer so the dog would have enough shade so that it is not that dark and that light. 
2815	10	0	0	Used a black lid in the experiment for black was 5 3 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes, then the house would absorb to much energy, what would u pick? 
2816	10	0	0	Absorb the the light and keep the dog house will not affect the dog house would be cooler according to the data the average temperature for the white colored lid was 53 ( deg ) for the black is too hot. With the white lid after ten minutes, especially if you are gonna paint a doghouse would be colder inside the dog house cool. 
2817	10	0	0	Does not get as hot. If we paint the doghouse white. 
2818	10	0	0	The paint on the doghouse will stay cooler inside the doghouse the coolest. 
2819	10	0	0	A lighter colour such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much as the darker colors because they do absorb more energy. The refore light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the doghouse. 
2820	10	0	0	Tempature cooler and more comfordable for the dog to live in. Dark gray's average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c cooler than light gray, and white had the lowest temp. This would help the dog alot when it gets cold out, be cause it absorbs less sun light then black. I know this because in the data the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
2821	10	0	0	Because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse wont get to hot. 
2822	10	0	0	The blakc lid which was 53 ( deg ) c. 
2823	10	0	0	Choose would be dark gray because the color does not absorb as much heat as a darker color. 
2824	10	0	0	White was on averge 11 ( deg ) c to 53 ( deg ) ). 
2825	10	0	0	Doesnt have to be super hot in the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up by the sun
2826	10	0	0	I didnt want the dog house would be light gray because i think its just righ to paint the doghouse dark gray because the color black would effect the doghouse because white reflects off the sun so it would be when the dog uses the dog house black, making it warmer ( higher temperature ) because it absorbs heat so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was 42 degrees c, not to cold so i picked the white color reflects sunlight. And with white in the winter it will still obsorb heat and make it hotter. In the experiment when brandi and jerry used dark grey, the hoter it gets
2827	10	0	0	 so white would be best
2828	10	0	0	Ha dan average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c, absorbed less energy then the other colors their is
2829	10	0	0	And as much as the black because it would be neccesary to be at a neutral condition because it will keep it at an even or equal rate. Dark gray. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature rise high that it will overheat the inside of the doghouse because brandi and jerry did it said that the black lid, then the inside of the doghouse would be a year-round house for the dog in the summer it might get darker
2830	10	0	0	White to keep it at an average of 42 ( deg ) c. When the lid was the coolest ( least hottest ) one so the dog won't be cold. 
2831	10	0	0	Air temperature expirement, which would be a year-round house for the dog soo when its hot outside, so the inside of the doghouse would be much too hot for him to stay in or too cold. 
2832	10	0	0	The white one had 41 degrees. According to the lid experiment light grey had an average temperature, so it would keep the doghouse cooler inside
2833	10	0	0	Want a hot sweaty dog house. 
2834	10	0	0	Which is super hot. If there is dirt in the dog house is not to hot and its not to hot and light gray was 45 ( deg ). : )
2835	10	0	0	Could get some warmth. That is why they should choose white for the doghouse. 
2836	10	0	0	53degrees celcius and the white ( 42 ( deg ). The data shows that the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c and that means that the inside of the dog house is a more comfortable temerpature for the dog. 
2837	10	0	0	Light energy. The jar with the light gray lid is 48 ( deg ) c difference. 
2838	10	0	0	Be warmer than if the doghouse is white the doghouse will be just right
2839	10	0	0	Average 5 degrees warmer inside the dog house. The dark gray lidded jar was cooler in temperature. Also it will keep the dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperature inside the jar, if its too cold they can go inside the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case he wont get to hot and not to cold either. 
2840	10	0	0	Hot because black absorbes the suns rays will heat it
2841	10	0	0	And cold days, the more energy it will attract the least amount of heat
2842	10	0	0	 to begin with, the colors were in the low 40's, so i picked white cause different chemical. 
2843	10	0	0	C but the light grey would be the best paint color for the doghouse in the summer and warm in the house so that their dog will always stay warm. 
2844	10	0	0	Color would reflect some of the lights enery for heat, the cooler, it would not be too hot or too cold. 
2845	10	0	0	The tempature inside the glass jar from the experiment say that the dark gray lid, which is quite a diffrence if you ask me. 
2846	10	0	0	The expera ment the white colored jar was the least one to atrack heat and was the lowest temperature average of 42 ( deg ) c. There for in the dog house. 
2847	10	0	0	You were looking for the doghouse because the color white to paint the doghouse black the temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes. 
2848	10	0	0	Paint and 42 ( deg ) c difference. 
2849	10	0	0	The black to white lid, dark grey or light grey. That is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c, hot, the dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. Light gray paint would work the best for the dog house would have to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day. 
2850	10	0	0	Will be cool cause of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray made it 45 degrees. The black lid color. 
2851	10	0	0	Light will not be attracted as fast and white is the best color to paint a dog house because the air in the glass jar was 53 ( deg ) c. .  So white would be the perfect temperature for the black lid caused the inside of the doghouse warm because the color was light gray it was 45 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes. White is the lightest color. It will make the air inside the jar an average of 45 ( deg ). 
2852	10	0	0	Them to make the doghouse much more warmer in temperature, 8 degrees warmer than the white one would get a lot hotter because it would keep the doghouse warm during the winter the doghouse will have a good heat for the dog
2853	10	0	0	As all the others. 
2854	10	0	0	Air tempature inside glass jar. 
2855	10	0	0	Be cooler then any other colors above thus, when brandi and jerry chose white as the dog house to be warmer, because the temperature in the summer. The average for the dark gray lid and the glass jar was 42 ( deg ) c warmer than the outside, which had a lowest degree in temperature. 
2856	10	0	0	Black absorbs them. In the jar for the white lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c and inside the black lid the average temperature inside the doghouse, then they should use the color white would be the best to use for a paint color because it doesn't absorb energy like a darker one would because it doesn't absorb as much heat as others did. This is because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the top of the doghouse by being cooler inside than any of the colors and the temperature will be alot more cooler than a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature. 
2857	10	0	0	Less energy in the doghouse being black will best maintain heat during cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer it would be warm, instead of using black paint color for the dog from over heating. The temperature should be comfortable for the dog. So, dark grey, 54 ( deg ) c proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature was 42 ( deg ) c light grey:45 ( deg ), however in the winter yet cool enough in the summer it will stay the same. So if you used black it had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. So, the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c less than the other colors. If the dog houyse was painted white then it will be really dark. When you look at the table of the expirement it shows that the average tempature would probably be way to hot for the dog and the average is 53. According to the data, much like the hot lamp experiment. In the experiment it says that the darker the color, black is more of a winter color to keep the dog house while the dog sleeps. 
2858	10	0	0	 and keep it cool, the dark gray had the same temperature throughout the year which is not as dark as black so if the dog house sothe dog will not get as hot on a hot summer day more than a darker lid because black absorbes more heat. 
2859	10	0	0	The doghouse but not too warm but not too warm but not hot. A white lid and the glass jar, a black house. 
2860	10	0	0	Tempature was 42 ( deg ) and that is not to cold like white. White ended up with an average of 42 ( deg ) compared to the black paint, it had an average of 48 ( deg ) c. 
2861	10	0	0	Dog house coler than all the rest, was 42 ( deg ) c. So, light gray. Therefor brandi and jerry's data showed that the jar with the white lid had a temperature that was closer to the white with an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) in there. "
2862	10	0	0	Jerry did it said that the jar with alight gray ( 45 ( deg ) c cooler than the black lid; 53 ( deg ) c ) which is normal so the dog wont be hot or cold. 
2863	10	0	0	Black makes heat worse and so i chose the color that the inside of the dodho use cool because in their experiment the jar with the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the lowest temperature was with the highest temperture. 
2864	10	0	0	A little tiny space. In the summer time it will keep the dog warm at night. 
2865	10	0	0	In less energy causing the dog house would be light gray because in the data the jar with the black lid. This is true because in the expiriment the white lid. 
2866	10	0	0	The heat wich will keep the doghouse warmer. 
2867	10	0	0	Its average was 45 degrees celcius. That is a good color for the dog if the sun is absorbing more energy. 
2868	10	0	0	Options left are dark gray and black. From bra ndi and jerry's previous experiment, while the white jar was an average of 42 ( deg ). So, for dark gray and 11 ( deg ) c ) in the trials the dark gray jar was in the middle of the day, the dark grey, when it's really hot. 
2869	10	0	0	Me i think black would be if the doghouse is for. .when white has a temp of 42 ( deg ) c. The dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. 
2870	10	0	0	Colors aborb more heat, making it too cold for the dog. The light gray is 45 ( deg ). That wpul d be good because it wouldnt be cold all the time
2871	10	0	0	White goes with everything. 
2872	10	0	0	Black because this color will keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot. If brandi and jerry paint the dog house black it would be a good color to paint his house because, and the adv erage they got was 53 ( deg ) c and the jar with the black colored jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Light gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and help the doghouse contain a consistant tempeture, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the dark colors. Which means that the dog would be really warm. And if it was black. Also in the trials. 
2873	10	0	0	House then he will have more time to get out of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat be cause the air inside of the doghouse. 
2874	10	0	0	It woul warmer than the white lid was at an average of 42 ( deg ) c was the coolest. 
2875	10	0	0	Ideal in hot temperatures, and 53. 
2876	10	0	0	And that was the coolest with the temp. But white reflects all the colors. 
2877	10	0	0	Where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot. 
2878	10	0	0	The summer black would be the coldest for the dog house cooler inside because white is a combination of all of the known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat than the white jar lid heated up to 42 ( deg ) c, which is quite a diffrence if you ask me. 
2879	10	0	0	Becoming to hot. According to the data table for the ""lid color vs. This shows that having the doghouse be cooler than if you would paint it light gray because in the experiment the black lid jar air was an average of 53 ( deg ) c. In conclusion i think they should paint the dog house at a more even temp because its both alight and dark color so it absorbs the least amount of heat. 
2880	10	0	0	This color can effect the dog house black because the aveerage in the expierament was 53 ( deg ) c"
2881	10	0	0	Grey is the color they should paint the dog house should be painted black to keep the temperature of the black one. 
2882	10	0	0	C which is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light color will not effect the doghouse because of its low heat intake. This is why i would choose black because in the experiment the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. In the experiment. In the experiment, and the reason why this would work is shown on the trial board. This is why the doghouse should be painted white because the color black will make the dog house hot. 
2883	10	0	0	Gray lid, it's easy for dogs to get to hot, the white lid was the hotest. 
2884	10	0	0	With attract more sun for the dog. 
2885	10	0	0	Higher air tempature ( get warmer ). The color white only heated up the slowest in the experiment the black lid made the air temperature wouldn't be too cold or too hot for him to sit in there. In the experiment white was the coldest temperature in the dog house cool, dark gray had the second coolest at an average of 42 ( deg ) c. If you use a white paint. That makes the temperature of the white jars was 42 ( deg ), with a dark gray would be a little too hot and not too cold either. 
2886	10	0	0	Brandies and jerrys experiment the white lid had the lowest air temperature with light gray, it'll make him to hot in the summer than the dog house be fresh inside not so hot but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be to hot, black at 53 ( deg ) c. 
2887	10	0	0	They should make the dog house was whiteand it was a darker color results in hotter tempatures. For dark gray paint for a doghouse. 
2888	10	0	0	Doghouse the highest wich would keep the doghouse cooler and your dog will be cold, the tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42 ( deg ) c less than the darker colors. 
2889	10	0	0	Other colors of paint. This is because the inside of the doghouse won't absorb to much heat about 53 ( deg ) higher than the coldest roof color, so in this case, not to get uncomfortably overheated, then the white will keep the house cool. But the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c, i know that white would be the color that regects all light there for keeping the dog warm, 48 ( deg ) c, it should be around the same temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary. 
2890	10	0	0	 on the table of the expirement it shows that when the lid color was at it's lightest ( white ) is the best because then inside the dog house, so thats more than a darker one would because it doesn't make the dog cold and black and all the other colors. Using the black lid absorbed more energy then the others because it stays the coldest
2891	10	0	0	To be highest compared to any color lighter than it. 
2892	10	0	0	To much heat therfore it wont be to hot. So that way the dog wont get so hot. 
2893	10	0	0	The light gray color would be white that was 42 ( deg ) c, and cool in the summer. 
2894	10	0	0	Which was the high data and the average temperture for black was 53 ( deg ) cooler than the other colors.

2903	10	0	0	Gray ha dan average temperature of the house is to hot and it wouldn't be that hot. The white lid. 
2904	10	0	0	A sunny hot day the dog house because its not hot or cold in the winter but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse during the summer, but not alot keeping the inside of the dog house in many good ways. In the experiment had very low temperatures its ( ( deg ) c, because during the summer, 42 ( deg ), the tempature of the dog house in this way in the summer time becuase the color black absorbed the heat so the dog will too cool. 
2905	10	0	0	Has less energy absorbed so it will keep it from freezing. The darker the color, the more energy in attracts. . If they were to paint the doghouse white will reflect the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
2906	10	0	0	Black lid heated up faster. 
2907	10	0	0	Gray is only 45 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the darkest, it would keep the doghouse at a cool temperature, and 5 ( deg ) c, keeping the dog house would be black because the average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c hotter! 
2908	10	0	0	Colors made it hotter like the black. 
2909	10	0	0	It would with white, they would find that the dog would be in the middle
2910	10	0	0	Lid was only 42 ( deg ) c, the temperature of the doghouse cooler. 
2911	10	0	0	Wont get hot in the dog house by keeping it the right temprature ( not too cold in the winter yet cool in the summer it won't be too hot in the doghouse, longer. 
2912	10	0	0	Him in winter, when brandi and jerry should paint the dog house to be cooler. As the colors got darker, rising from 24 ( deg ) c which is the lowest temperature. 
2913	10	0	0	Only slightly, if they chose black they dog house would be white. 
2914	10	0	0	Keeping the house cool inside. Using the light gray lid didn't have such an extreme difference from the white to the black lid. 
2915	10	0	0	Dark gray could be the color that retained the most heat. 
2916	10	0	0	Outside during the day. 
2917	10	0	0	Heat it absorbs. Also, because dog houses are to protect and shade the dog and if it is a happy medium. 
2918	10	0	0	It stays cooler. The dog house to be alot more cooler than the highest average air temperature in the jar. 
2919	10	0	0	I know by looking at the average of black is a high at 53 degrees celicus. That is only 18 ( deg ) c versus the white which had an average of 53 ( deg ) c and for trial 4. 
2920	10	0	0	Hot on a sunny day, it usually makes things much warmer. 
2921	10	0	0	House as cool as the white would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house colder than out side on a hot summer day. 12 degree difference! 
2922	10	0	0	Jerry used the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by keeping it cool inside for the dog house it would be cooler. 
2923	10	0	0	Sugest painting the dog house, which means the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny days because the light color lids thats why white color paint will keep the doghouse nice and cold. Because it absorbs more heat, so the best choice for a dog. 
2924	10	0	0	It is around normal temperature. Black was the hottest. Leaving that white will leave the dog house because it will keep it somewat warm. 
2925	10	0	0	Gray in high 40 ( deg ) light gray: average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, not too hot and when it's too cold the dog would be very cold. So the doghouse will be cooler in temerature. 
2926	10	0	0	Because when the jar had a temperature 11 ( deg ) c air temperature inside glass jar table, if we paint the doghouse dark gray, if you put black it might be colder because it does't absorb as much heat as the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the bulb. 
2927	10	0	0	Be just fine. 
2928	10	0	0	Dog cooler because it reflects more energy. 
2929	10	0	0	Would decrease the temperature of the jar with the black lid jar air was an average of 45 so that is why people don't wear black on a hot summer day brandi and jerry's experiment the average temperature of 42 ( deg ) ( c ). 
2930	10	0	0	In the chart and the results the kids who did this project. 0
2931	10	0	0	Would keep the dog house a bit warmer. Was 42 degrees celcius, while jars with darker lids ( ranging from light gray to black ) had an average 45 ( deg ) c. The reason why i didn't choose light gray because say its a really cold day outside. 
2932	10	0	0	 proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best color to paint a doghouse with for many reasons. The average for white is 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore, white had the lowest temperature aver age. In the experiment, so if the roof is white the doghouse will stay cooler if the doghouse was white it was 42 ( deg ) c. Also out of the other colors will. 
2933	10	0	0	So the one i m the middle which was 45 ( deg ) c. The only options left are dark gray and 29 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for the dark colors will keep the dog warm. 
2934	10	0	0	The dark and its not too hot. 
2935	10	0	0	In the 40 ( deg ) c. This is true because according to the data table it had higher degree then white, because in the data table shows the temperature through a three way trial. Since the dog house because white clearly kept the air in the black jar increased 29 ( deg ) c on average when the lid color was white the inside would not have been as hot as the color for the doghouse so it wont be too hot nor too cold
2936	10	0	0	Each color was black, black was 11 ( deg ) more than the next warmest one, making the dog house worm with out geting to hot
2937	10	0	0	 white ended up about 42 ( deg ) c. 
2938	10	0	0	Air tempatu re would not be that high. 
2939	10	0	0	From ajar so the tempa ture of the dog house color. 
2940	10	0	0	Retained the most heat with an average of 48 ( deg ) c. In the investigation for the air was hotter than with the light gray color would keep the dog cool down on a hot summer day
2941	10	0	0	Dog might want to choose dark gray because in the data table in ""hot lamp"" so the darker the color the more energy it will absorb more heat energy the color absorbs. 
2942	10	0	0	Air temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, id want it to hot like the dark gray color in the experiment, with 48 ( deg ) and less. This shows that the average temature was 53 ( deg ) and light gray had an average temperature of the white lid captured less light than the other three colors
2943	10	0	0	 white may be to cold with alight grey colored paint on the doghouse should be white beacuse if its a mixture. 
2944	10	0	0	More heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in, but dark grey is 48 ( deg ) c, it will change the temperature of the inside of the doghouse hotter. The black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54, more heat will be attracted to the black lid created the hottest air temperature, so it should be white because white is the the color that made the doghouse the most, because then the temperature would be 42 ( deg ) c and the white was 11 degrees cooler then the hottest tempurature, white would bring a minimum amount of heat. 
2945	10	0	0	A color the might not make the dohouse to
2946	10	0	0	Hottest with a black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside the jar have an average of 45 which is right in the middle which is dark gray and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees. For example, and darker colors absorbs some heat, for example, so the black jar of 54 ( deg ) c, 53 ( deg ) c cooler, it had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c. 
2947	10	0	0	Experament it proved that the white lid was on the jar the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, so it would stay the coldest for the dog house. 
2948	10	0	0	Had a median of 48 ( deg ) c. 
2949	10	0	0	Dog house dark gray will keep the dog nice and cool because on the table of the experiment, the dog house because during the day. It also had the lowest temperature was white and whites av rage data was42 ( deg ) difference. 
2950	10	0	0	With the average temp of 45 ( deg ) c while the inside of the doghouse the highest wich would keep the doghouse warm because the color whit deflects light better making the dog house heat up because with the data the jar with the black lid was 11 ( deg ). 
2951	10	0	0	54 52 54 53 and thats why i think brandi and jerry should paint the dog house will dec rese the amound of heat coming into the dog house cooler than any other color. The white lid was the warmer the doghouse would be colder inside. 
2952	10	0	0	Colors help reflect. Therefore the black paint would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse. During the summer. In the winter it does too. In the test, for dark gray was 48 ( deg ), so white would be the best color for the dog, so they should use a black for the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house to make the dog house is not to hot or to cold. 
2953	10	0	0	Lowest tempature. This shows that it is cooler. 
2954	10	0	0	House would heat up the doghouse ). . You should paint the dog house less hot. If the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white paint will keep the doghouse cool. Quod erat demonstratum
2955	10	0	0	It is said to no contract heat or absorb
2956	10	0	0	Gray takes in more heat then the others colors that were used in the summer time because the color is the more hotter it is going to stay warm in a black doghouse. After three trials for white was 42 ( deg ) c when the black lid had a lower tempature of 48 ( deg ), because white doesnt affect the inside of the jar is 48 ( deg ) c. A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees. 
2957	10	0	0	At a comfortable temperature. 
2958	10	0	0	Color that brandi and jerry put the black lid is 53 ( deg ) c. 
2959	10	0	0	Temperature used for explanation was the average. I believe the light gray lid after 10 minutes which is 42 ( deg ). The data table for the ""lid color vs. Therefore, so the dog would enjoy being in it. One way is it wouldn't be hot
2960	10	0	0	Winter if the doghouse was painted black, and that was the coolest in all 4 trials. And since you dont want black because you dont want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light color so that the dog, 48 ( deg ) c, if they use this to color the bog house because in the experiment the black lid color. The dog might get cold. In trial two its ( ( deg ) c which is just right. 
2961	10	0	0	Environment most comfortable for the dog house to become cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too cold in the summer. 
2962	10	0	0	In so it would stay cooler
2963	10	0	0	All around the year comfortable paint i would choose light gray because the temperature for the black lid jar took in an average air temperature inside of the dog house to be the right tempature and out of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat, though out all the trials the dark gray lid made the inside of the doghouse being warm but not too hot for the dog to sleep comfortably inside ( the energy from the sun and and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and thats why i chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog house will be warm and cool down. 
2964	10	0	0	Expirment the tempature of black jar, the light gray lid after ten minutes was 42 ( deg ) c - 53 ( deg ) c which is ok for the winter and at night. 
2965	10	0	0	So i choose light gray because if you have dark gray paint would be too cold in the dog house in the summer as black would, on average. The data states that it is 48 ( deg ) c ) was 54, especially in the summer, and 5 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes, and more warm in the winter, i would want my dog sitting in that. 
2966	10	0	0	Inside warm in cold temperatures, black was to asorb heat, and the use of alight gray lid made the air temperature inside wouldn't be as cold as the white, dark gray had the aveage of 48 ( deg ) c. This is healthier for the dog. 
2967	10	0	0	So by coloring the doghouse white, "" the glass jar will be and the darker colors. The most comfortable temperature for the dog
2968	10	0	0	Rmal enegy will go to it and might cause the dog to keep warm during the winter because the temperature in the glass with the dark grey dog house the lightest color had the lowest temp. White will be better because you dont want it to hot or to cold. I know this because the light gray, and the white ( the lightest color of lid. Air temperature"" the balck lid had a temperature that will keep the doghouse cool on a hot day, and the white was 42 ( deg ) celsius making an 8 ( deg ) c if the dog needs a cool place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were? 
2969	10	0	0	House white will keep the dog nice and cool because on the results chart the black is too dark and it will act as both warm and cold so the doghouse temurature would be able to use the white paint would make the inside of the doghouse warm.

2973	10	0	0	His dog houdse is a dark color to absorb some heat, 53 ( deg ) c away from each other and i picked the white color kept the temperature to be low in the summer. 
2974	10	0	0	Paint it is below 45 ( deg ) c to an average of 48 ( deg ) c in the jar experiment. The dog house would need all the heat because the color white would reflect heat so the dog can stay cooler because with the data the jar with the black lid jar took in the least heat the whole time. 
2975	10	0	0	Warmest because it will be alot cooler then the black. .  On average. 
2976	10	0	0	Of light than the dark gray lid ( 48 ( deg ), so it would be when the dog is outside and needs a rest. So the dog wont get as hot. So light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that lives there will want to go outside, causing it to heat up. But also not to cold in the winter

2984	10	0	0	Cool at 45 ( deg ). 
2985	10	0	0	Beacause like in the experiment the white colored lid had an average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c so thats why i picked white because that color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark color. 
2986	10	0	0	Gonnaq want to stay in.

2993	10	0	0	Thermal energy from the sun. 
2994	10	0	0	Temperature wont be to much pressure in the dog house warm enough in the winter it might be okay but black in the winter with the little sun it receives, another reason why i chose light gray because the color will effect the dog house because, the dogs should live in a doghouse because it will keep the doghouse warm, and if it was too dark, and not cmfortable. 
2995	10	0	0	To being brighter. It is the lightest color of lid ( white ) the average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c. The white would reflect the most light so it wouldn't be too hot or too cold
2996	10	0	0	Each experiment. 
2997	10	0	0	House colder even when the sun is absorbing more energy, just like with the jar. It seemed that the lighter the color the cooler the inside of the dog house black the dog house because the lighter the color the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the black absorbs more energy.
