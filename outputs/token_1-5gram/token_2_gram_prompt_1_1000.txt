They need to replicate this experiment. It says (2) pour vinegar the experiment is: how much vinegar is up in step 3, the experiment i would be different kind of three additional information that is how much or containers should also need to retest this procedure doesn't say to know how much vinager should be clear and find out of vinegar placed in there are doing the four containers you putting in order to specify how much vinegar to replicate

Also, you would be useful to know the 24 hours (under sunlight and problem is how much vinegar into each cup, step 2, pour into the two how much of each individed
144	1	0	0	Rending the amounts then i would be what the last additional information that they are the samples were taken out to know now much vinegar was being massed and the amount of surrounding do this experiment i realized that i would need to put the rock form and how long to know how much vinegar to replicate the control set amount of container, it then what qualities  ^p 1.how big of the experiment, and the vinegar into on. A plastic. 
145	1	0	0	Distinction of each cap and also be able to replicate this experiment would need to know a graph for example, their experiment/lab.

They should be able to know how much vinegar should specify what happend in the containers concerning how big the containers. Some additional information you would need to use in their experiment. The group's procedure have an even size of liquid, what  also need to put in. Limestone, ^p 2. One last thing i would would be added to mention of viniger they should say how long and more than the solution/room could have to tell you would need samples.

152	1	0	0	Disadvantage because it should be added between steps 1 of each sample to be rinsed, it lacks important details. The 4 more detailed procedure, ,, you would be, you when replicating if they should the person would also need to tell exactly the difference of area to come out a table. Why the lab exactly the samples are trying to understand it is need to replicate this experiment, also need to know what four different samples that went. 
153	1	0	0	Revisions of vinegar was added. I believe that you would need to know were their data. You will need to know what the cups. How much vinegar to say, a lot of light or closed or the starting and problem statement, the experiment i would also failed to record the procedure should it should explain how large effect of a time you poured into water you would place in each container.

Also need to the group neglected to find the ending mass. 4 of the sample with in each sample  and how much vinegar was placed into the temperature.

Most importantly, how much vinegar without that information to replicate this experiment design of rocks with. 
182	1	0	0	Sure the group should be as a lid to know what the four samples being tested & 3 try using and plastic, ^p let it would me to replicate this experiment for longer  i would need to be helpful to know how to replicate this experiment is the mass of vinegar is decreases. The containers. I would be more details will help also need in this experiment replicable. In step, they used in the procedure. They should also what my hands, like to know what the experiment is needed in each sample has to get an amount of information  secondly, also how much of container, you do you how much distilled water. 
183	1	0	0	Canter, finally, how long do. All 4 kind of vinegar i would need to do you are determining the cup, the group did the students procedure 3 things.

I would need to determine the conditions are the begining and may be poured into containers, after 24 hours at. Another piece of cups in order to replicate this experiment i would want to use.

They only have different samples in each separate container and dependent variable and if there should include all in making this experiment is poored into one might say how the groups procedure simply there only looked at because if it dry slower then also need to note samples need more specific so i removing the four samples.

You would be covered or different placements, as much vinegar is very hot? I would be more contact with the corrections will need to other information i would need to replicate the solution should given, plastic.

You end mass, i would be in step 3, or what size contaner and how much vinegar to know how much vinegar should also need to run atleast 3 minutes, i think you do i would be instruction on how much vinegar to add another piece of samples right or less significant effect on mass of vinegar. 
661	1	0	0	Procdure also say repeat with all be information, determine the word sample you would need to see p it seems to replicate this investigation was i would need to know the procedure of each object, they should be needed like put something to each sample into each sample at these materials, they must have to replicate the mass i should also need to replicate this will need the mass each sample of the same masses before and a sample is what the marble and label on.

I would need to know how much vinegar you are using for a lot more directions and the difference in mass, also need some marbles, there should add 4 types of the experiment a clear. I would need to determine the samples  i would need to know the experiment and more descriptive and the amount of vinegar in grams before to do. If left out a given in each container and the same or the amount of the mass of vinegar we should place marble, i would need additional information that you also i myself or
806	1	0	0	Complete the starting mass, also need to allow the end.

The samples from there procedure is how much vinegar to go and also need to replicate the sender to know maybe, lastly, which sample into container would have to know the temperature of the starting mass of the experiment again? Plastic. To solve. Lastly what kind of the 24hours would need to rinse them on how  the samples. It be added more suspific as knowing the experiment, the temperature over min should be poured in order to find the four separate that would need to increase the measurement of the procedure.

Size of each cup (m/s), you to put the procedure does it before you need to know how long or too much vinegar put in water inthe sample and rinse each material in. I would need to tell where the size containers. Another liquid to replicate the mass?

Use or how much vinegar is so people can be repllcated there was ""10.4"" for all of all this experiment, so that you are listed in the samples dry for 30 minutes. And drt for, a more densely packed the starting amount of the starting mass and if container without measurements of the groups, the tested in step 4 containers.

They haven't been more specific amount of measuring the wight of the amount of the cup and how much vinegar on the cups so i would need to make a dependent variadle and put in each has more vinegar to replicate the when samples.

This is poured into the mass of the steps to the point and how much vinegar used to use when you would need to know the experiment, darkness outside. It in each sample and plastic, i doesn't tell you need a sample should include marble, wood and plastic.

977	1	0	0	Temperatur after i would be to know in mass from the mass of the experiment to replicate the first thing that is needed is calibrated. They need too also what i could affect the experience and what the mass of info they tried to pour the experiment, how all of the procedure.

987	1	0	0	Problems with distilled water for the words, or size containers, it happen if they can affect the amount given procedure, one more reliable one each of container, the four samples and any of vinegar more clear and see the group os material they could also instead of vinegar you may or scale to know how much vinegar to sample when other information. What samples sit and how much vinegar to do it should include what to do the containers they divide the procedure did they be added into the mass.
