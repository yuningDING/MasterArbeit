Next, they have chosen one main point, crash course, and finally, we find out its just a tool bag? 'then, the author starts out explaining that remains of satellites that have been destroyed now clutter the pathways around earth and how it occurs- providing strictly fact or background information on satellites history and strong conclusion warning the reader about small objects the size of a very small rock and it's ability to strip paint from a concrete wall.
