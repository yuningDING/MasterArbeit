Aunt kolab said, 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family? ' rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this because when rose's aunt kolab asked is rose felt weighed down by this family, she doesn't completely agree with what she is doin. Her sister said that she hate when she stay up late working. 
33688	7	0	0	 she always goes to school then she turns around and goes to work, make supper, and then do her homework. This relates to her conversation with aunt kolab is caring.

She begins the conversation with anna gives rose a comforting older sister personality. 'i'm so lonesome for papa. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it was aunt kolab making the muted noises coming from the kitchen. Rose says only if you already have everything. '

She was more respectful. 
33704	7	0	0	Is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and all the other conflicts in her life. 
33705	7	0	0	Her hands and thinking 'paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example showing how she feels responsibility for her family. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help rose not feel this way. 
33706	7	0	0	Describe her would be, strong. Strength seems to fit her based on what she is trying to do for her family. 
33707	7	0	0	A college scholarship all at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think this is a good trait to have. She offers ideas to her aunt to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college. 
33708	7	0	0	And leaves but rose did have a motherly instinct and did try to comfort her with her problems trying to solve them for her by talking to her an giveing her ideas on how to solve her problems with her job an work, how to get things set in her life. 
33709	7	0	0	Then she is on the verge of getting fired because she is taking to many days off for the essay and to watch her little sister.

33712	7	0	0	The responsability she has for the family. 
33713	7	0	0	And tell her that the job pays more, and that paul will help us, her dad will be back, she wasn't meaning to be harsh towards her sister, or talking to her aunt kolab, shows a great deal of respect. I know this because when she is talking to anna, i conclude that rose is like a mother, always worrying and trying to act older than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she does not like sharing are feelings about being pressured to help out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the story her aunt specifically asks her if she felt weighed down and she didnt respond so it makes me think she wnated to say yes. 
33714	7	0	0	First in everything she does, and she cares more of how others feel than herself. An example from the article is; (last paragraph) rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. 
33715	7	0	0	She started on another subject. 
33716	7	0	0	With anna when she hides her emotions from anna. This is evident when anna says to her, she is a 'people pleaser' but she feels helpless because she is so worried about her brother and is positive about the work she must do but she continues to help and tries not to complain even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down by her family problems like she does. She has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning. All of this is necessary. But she also doesn't want to tell her aunt how busy and stress she is. She has dreams about everything. 
33717	7	0	0	 i say this because in the story she si stell aunt kolab that she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do it. 'ann is mom home yet. ' 'rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer. '
33718	7	0	0	She wants tobe free, but rather she would want the happiness of her own family before hers. Since rose is a caring person and that is why she says 'what's wrong? You feel okay? '
33719	7	0	0	Would tell her mother. This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought, 'rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. (line 21) rose nodded. 
33720	7	0	0	Things in her day and gets tired often. 
33721	7	0	0	Sure her sister is okay in paragraph 5. 'what's wrong? You feel okay? ''
33722	7	0	0	Worry about even when rose her self is as little worried. 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. '
33723	7	0	0	 because he is working in las angeles. 
33724	7	0	0	Concentrated on how busy she is. 
33725	7	0	0	Is she is put under a lot of pressure because she has to work and go to school she tries to push forward for her family. Despite all the stress from school and work, she still has to do homework. 
33726	7	0	0	To collage and then send monry back so that her sister can go. 
33727	7	0	0	How she can make things different and rose says 'maybe her life would get easier. 
33728	7	0	0	Is demonstrated by the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story when her aunt was talking to her aunt kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to do. She wants to help out. One detail that supports rose being determined is how even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to hurt her. An example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, and tries to explain it so that she can make anna feel better about the situation when, in line 12, she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college and get a good job and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'. 
33729	7	0	0	Quick joke about money to lighten the mood.

Picturing the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork, and a four-hour shift and still finds time to write an essay for her older brother and is still able to carry that weight with her. She showed this when she talked about her work and her paper. But istead, she tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her. ' this shows that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'we have our part to do to help paul finish  college. Then he'll get a good job, anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college. She is understanding of the situation and the essay that she has to help cook supper. 
33731	7	0	0	Chance to go to sacramento. 
33732	7	0	0	And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother. This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought, i won't get to travel to sacramento to receive the prize. '
33733	7	0	0	 who is trying to be positive for her sister. She made a joke about money, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she knew it would hurt her feelings. 
33734	7	0	0	Her dedication to getting her work done. Rose is easily pressured from all the work she is doing is for the good of her family. Rose said, 'he had to go. The job in los angelos is better paying and they need the money, untill she started talking to her sister anna. She realizes how other people sees her situation. 'but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should because you grew up here. ... This must be difficult for you. Yes? " 
33735	7	0	0	That she is caring. She encourages her sister that everything will be ok. When her sister was up and walked into her room rose immediately asked what was wrong. Also when anna got upset rose tryed to cheer her up by making a joke and laughing. Although, anne is right about money isn't everything. 
33736	7	0	0	That everything will work out in the end. 
33737	7	0	0	Believe that one trait about rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. One example from the passage is when she says, ''do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing for this family. These example show that rose is a caring individual and could be more mature for her age. 
33738	7	0	0	College and getting a good job to pay for paul's college education. One detail from the story is that she works hard for the success of others, but also has a state contest for an essay she really wants to win to go to sacromento. But then she is on the verge of firing her. '
33739	7	0	0	 i feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort, and make it seem better by saying that their father had to go and that the job paid more and it would help to go to college and actually getting something out of life. Another, example is when rose woke up and the rubbing her neck. She remebered that she was thinking of a topic, for her sister and herself. 
33740	7	0	0	Rose trys to tell anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried. 
33741	7	0	0	Very mature and understands this conflict as an adult. 
33742	7	0	0	Other activities such as the three thousand word essay because she has work and has to help out with the paul's college fees then he'll get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to collage.
