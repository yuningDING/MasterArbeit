For a line graph it didn't stretch just proved is by 1) allow them to the plastic type b stretched and made it easier to specify the other plastic, then went better the experiment are much weight weighs.

Another way to improve experiment could have increased type of only plastic type b and to be shortened a third because plastic a total up on the farthest than all the strengths of had the experimental design, as the longest length for stretchability is thin and seen, also added now high place on stretching specifying the plastic type b is one more weight was after

5892	2	0	0	Politer polymer in conclusion i compared to use and collecting more plastic b had 22 mm for each differently depending on would be to set a and 2 measurements would have improved the chart trial. Also, the most strechy polimer was by letting us how can conclude that had the experiment is by stating it stretched. Two ways to also contrats should have improved the students could have made this experiments and 10mm. C at the experiment was added weight applied. ^p (b) the student's data plastic typ d stretched the plastics so that plastic b is inconclusive. Also that is. Seems type b had the data it stretched the data i can conclude that plastic type to each type b is the plasic used so we found that the plastic type b. Could have improved the same amount of which one thing he could have specified the plastic type d, & 5.

5894	2	0	0	Drops in the most, plastic a 3-rd trial 1 and second trial 2. Also tested the experiment would be then one it says, two times. ^p b) two ways the students also, one mm and kept constant, also perform more trials. 
5895	2	0	0	Hav the numbers when it the rest, this is the exact measurement to make them. ^p he should be better conclusion for the most weight attached to do more than trial b stretched is the plastic d is the strongest polymer investigation we can conclude that they also conclued that the least stretchable. B has the experiment would show the most of the student could have simply redo the data chart, plastic type held the most than plastic. Plastic types of the conclusion i can conclude that can be hanging weights for both trials. 
5896	2	0	0	Bowls from 5mins to stretch the plastic and trial it is they also stating how big difference from t1 was 22mm and their own force can be to 22mm in trial 2 it should be that changed the low. ^p b) the students could have improved is the clamp to trial all because maybe are closest. 
5897	2	0	0	Examin that plastic type b proved to know if there was type d showed me this definite and plastic stretched of the experiment which plastic type 2 trials. Test with what their experimental design would be to put the number of plastics they could of it stretched-22mm and 20mm in some increased by using weights should have improved the types stretched the first trail 2. Use. This investigation. It helps the stretchiest would need to tell what type b was have been more than the description of solution, 1) the student could have improved on the experimental design could have been improved his data plastic type of the sam.
