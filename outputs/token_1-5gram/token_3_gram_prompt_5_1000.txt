21678	5	0	0	Of four major steps. It takes the mrna leaves the nucleus. The peptide chain making it grow. Termination- the mrna then goes back to recieve the information to the golgi apparatus4.)the golgi apparatus, trna reads the message decoded. 3.the trna travels in a single strand of mrna. The nucleus. Those are four major steps involved in protein synthesis  of course then goes out and finds the matching portion of dna goes through to other parts of the nucleus to proteins. The nucleus, anaphase, telling them to the codon3. Trna transfers the protein that your cells divide and then it would then be sent to the dna
21679	5	0	0	Protein exits the cell. Than the mrna splits in two and starts to copy the stand, it then goes to the dna, metaphase, called codons. The information carried by the trna forms the code in the cell gets back in two. You have the blueprint copied and translated through translation
21680	5	0	0	That  are involved whenever the mrna. It then gets the corresponding rna is used to make the proteins. The rrna according to what they are produced. 
21681	5	0	0	Has been read, prophase. Forming the peptyde chain of amino acids that match up with the mrna.3.  Third, and another hooks on. Then passes on data or mrna. The trna comes along. The ribosomes biuld the mrna goes to the amino acids form together to form their makeups. Then it leaves the nucleus2)mrna gives the information. 
21682	5	0	0	Sythesis starts with the codon information.2. It takes the nformation outside of the protein will be taken out. 
21683	5	0	0	Feel refreshed. The mrna get the message from the nitrogen bases. The explanations for the process begins again. This trna molecule has one of the protein and nutrients that it turns into dna
21684	5	0	0	A peptide bond with the trna brings the materials needed to sythesize protien.

21693	5	0	0	Nucleus controls what happens. ..idk
21694	5	0	0	Membrane begans to break down into the blood stream. Then the mrna is transported throughout the body3. The mrna takes the information in sequences of 3 nucleotides, the last step is replication. The trna and relays that message. When the trna molecules form peptide bonds. 4. The protien. 3.the trna travels to where it needs to be made. From there, the mrna leaves the nucleus, it produces sugars, the two half strands pair up with trna
21695	5	0	0	Is taken to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.2. Now it will kill you really bad. 
21696	5	0	0	Last in the ribosome. The trna. Trna brings amino acids and bring back a new cell
21697	5	0	0	Or business. The amino acids, from the nerves it then protects the material throughout the body if something is hurt or if the code to begin protein synthesis.2. The mrna leaves the nucleus, which start producing protein and nutrients that it sends the material throughout the body for energy in the cell
21698	5	0	0	Readable to the trna sequence, the trna. Step 3:they get to the nucleus, it then begins to decode the message.2. Gives the mrna, metaphase, the line of nitrogen bases pair up with a stop codon is identify and complemented. And the sequencing will stop. 
21699	5	0	0	Rna attaches to the nuclues then gets the dna and it goes to the ribosomesthe trna transferes the dna it makes copys of more amino acids, metaphase, metaphase, mrna, good for youmakes you stronggood for health

21703	5	0	0	Transfered3 carried to nucleus4 protein synthesis
21704	5	0	0	Other good cells that are needed most. 
21705	5	0	0	What not. Then it brings them back to the ribosomes in the cells and start to decode the strand. The trna changes thymine into uracil3.the mrna changes in to trna to transfer the message to the amino acids to the spot they need proteins. 
21706	5	0	0	Small enough to fit into the cytoplasm. This is the mrna leaves the nucleus, segments are put together with peptide bonds to create a protein strip. The ribosome reads the mrna leaves the nucleus and matches it with peptide bonds. Then the small and large ribosomes then attach to the stomach4. The mrna contains the amino acid sequence to produce more rna, a trna molecule by a rna strand. Finally, it makes the protienthe golgie bodys pack it up and makes a copy of rna which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids that link together to make a protein so it unwinds its self, it attaches itself to distribute throughout the body the stuff from the nucleus. After that it could be passed on by rrna3. When the trna will take the information it has to reproduce, and the mrna is transferred using trna.3. The trna then transfers it to the ribosomes it goes to the ribosomes. Acid is formed. 
21707	5	0	0	Enter trna, and brings it to to other rnas and then the rrna, a will deliver the protein and goes to the endoplasmic reticulum.3. It travels to the mrna's anticodons. After all of that it is carried to where it needs to be coded
21708	5	0	0	Move or stay3. It will then go back into the cytoplasm and delivers them to require enough energy to make protein. This trna will find the amino acid, interphase
21709	5	0	0	Copied dna and leaves the nucleus mrna go to the peptide begins as various trna's reach the stop codon. (3)the ribosome matches the codon. Then the mrna through the cell.

21711	5	0	0	Has been formed, the first stade of meiosis. It is single stranded rna to find a protein. The left over material is transcribed. When attached to the ribosomes give the body and give the rrna would bind amino acids tell wich enzymes. Trna finds its matching sstrand and then goes to the correct codon to the nucleus it contacts the trna then translate the sequence-rrna create ribosomes for the rna will transcribe the mrna goes to the nucleus into the ribosomein the ribosome reads the mrna needs. 
21712	5	0	0	See if there are many parts to make a new strand to make a polypeptide bond. It translates the dna strand is changed into rrna. Then the lysosomes to produce anticodons.3. Trna brings the mrna to trna and transfers into to so it unwinds its self like for a new strand of dna. Every three sections of three neuclotides. The codons can attach itself to a veshicle then goes to the ribosome. Another major step is when dna is transfered
21713	5	0	0	The amiuno acid code is given
21714	5	0	0	Looks like a blueprint as the hydrogen bond brakes and that copy goes out to another over and the protein is completly made. Third the amino acids to get.4. Last they transfer it to the making of the srtand
21715	5	0	0	Brand new strands are checked over to insure there were no wrongly placed codons
21716	5	0	0	The transfering of the dna molecule producing new segments of rna that binded, metaphase, it then takes it to the ribosome and gives it a boost
21717	5	0	0	Segment of dna is stored. After interfase is prophase 3 is metaphase. After that the nucleotide. Once the message that it makes a  copy of the nitrogonous bases.

Telephase: cell divides into two identical daughter cells are copied back into mrna and connects its segments to the ribosomes and make a protien
21727	5	0	0	The treatment he was recieving so he left. Then the gogi body out the process. The second step would have to have proteinssecond it has to travel to the trna moving ribosomes. Then it foes down into the rna
21728	5	0	0	A defect in the cytoplasm to be remade.2. Mrna goes to the endoplasmic reticulum to go. The codons with the information from the ribosomes to break apart and go to different parts of the amino acid. Then last it creates sequences and they eventually have some children and live the good is then copied again an then it attaches on to the polypeptide chain. The mrna with other proteins went.4: the body then makes the protein is synthesized to match the exact specifications of the cell. 
21729	5	0	0	Acidsthe chain of amino acidsthe  codons ar turned into trna and that amnio acid comes and aids the process starts over again.

21734	5	0	0	They bring the correct codon to the rna is 'coded' into an amino acid. This will keep going until it reaches the stop codon arises and the small and large ribosomes come attach to and from cells.4. Cell walls come in and connect with to make protien. They form a new strand onto the rna attaches to a ribosome, because you know what else. Once here a amino acid sequence that makes copies, the cell can function properly
21735	5	0	0	To amino acids.3. The rrna stage to deliever the message back to the mrna is run through the nuclear membrane. Trna finds complementary bases
21736	5	0	0	And translates it into protein. It is used to find a part of its self like for a specific protien. 
21737	5	0	0	Whether it be personal or business. The dna is made

21740	5	0	0	To fix it. The ribosomes give the body is healthy, forming a strand of dna goes through the krebs cycle3.then the protiens to all other amino acids making a complete protein. 3. Metaphase- getting itself ready to be coppied and then go back into the golgi apparatus where the ribosome to attache to the nucleus to the ribosomes.2) ribosome makes the amino acid sequence is reached, it attaches to the cell membrane. This bond folds and is shipped to other rnas and then that travels around and is then turned into a product that will form one section of dna
21741	5	0	0	The g0 phase. Then it is making its red blood cells.2. Rna which is an exact clone of the cell to be copied and then transfered back into mrna in the cell.

21745	5	0	0	The blueprint copied and zipped back up to the ribosome form a protien chain. After this a complementary strand is translated into trna and translation occur. Then it has to translate what the mrna is translated in the middle. All the trnathen the mrna to the golgi bodies where transferrna gets the rest of the strands have to leave the ribosome. 4. The amino acids. Finally, and than starts all over the anticodon, it then uses those proteins. Second, rrna comes and aids the process starts which decodes the mrna is a protein consisting of animo acids, cells
21746	5	0	0	Opposite poles. This then produces protein
21747	5	0	0	Goes diffusion then the mrna releases from the nucleus. The trna how to make mrna. Than the mrna joins with the one thing then the enzyme helps bond the chain to then be added to the body and finally becomes a protein.

21761	5	0	0	Is dna spliting into two identical halves, in anaphase the chromosomes began to produce proteins. This happens because of ribosomes. The next step is mrnathe last step is rna enters the body for the trna takes and makes an amino acid4) after this rrna takes the information of the nucleus to take the c and chang it to the ribosome.2. It tranfers into trna.3. That attaches to a ribosome. For the amino acids4. They are done they get to were it came from. 
21762	5	0	0	Change the rna to translate the dna. Trna carrying an amino acid sequences, processing proteins, trna, then the final amino acid that matches the code for an amino acid which forms a codon, transcription and translation. Another major step is the mrna will then turn into protein.

21765	5	0	0	Then anticodons start to attch to the endoplasmic reticulum where, because it is read by the mitochondria, and to a strand of dna is then synthesized by the rrna. Then it connicts to the nucleus and goes to a ribison to become mrna. The amino acid chain is formed
21766	5	0	0	Hands of the cell copys the rna strand with a strand of rna that binded, interphase, transcription is the mrna leaves the nucleus-mrna travels to the right base of each other and form a chain-proteins, the new rna. These codons have counterpartners. Following this step, ribsomes, copying the nucleotides are put together to make a bopy of itself to the protein that attaches to it. The information, anaphase, oxygen, absorbin the minerals, after that then creates amino acidsthey are converted into codonsthey are then joined together transmit through the nucleaus it is broken down into the body.4.
