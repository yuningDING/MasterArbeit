23177	5	0	0	In your body that give more oxygen each time. 
23178	5	0	0	Considered trna then attaches to a protein to code for an amino acid.4) a protein is formed by a strain of amino acids joined by petide bonds. 
23179	5	0	0	 and calls for a trna molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. The rna then is checked for mistakes. Then, it is bonded to a ribosome and it starts to build a rna molecule. After the opposite strand is made, is met by a trna which takes the protein and moves it away, then the cell stores the proteins and uses them. 
23180	5	0	0	Mrna leaving the nucleus and then duplicated and seperated. 
23181	5	0	0	Used for whatever is needed), it is bonded to a ribosome and then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes and tells the cell what dna sequences to make. After that, the process of rna is shown, and it starts to decode the mrna. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids as more trna come and once the bond forms between the two amino acids and the mrna tells the ribosome how to make the protein. 
23182	5	0	0	Becomes mrna it sends out messages to other rnas and then the mrna attatches to a ribison to become rran and the n when the rrna matches up with rrna it transfers into an tran to exchange its geneitc information
23183	5	0	0	The mrna fills in one of the sides of the dna once the whole strand has been remade the mrna goes to a ribosome. Then a machine reads its codon. The proper protiens are brought togeather to make a protien. 
23184	5	0	0	Contain the same sequence of rna. An anticodon is attached to the original strand of dna
23185	5	0	0	The strand goes to a ribosome. Then trna will bring the attacted amino acids to the ribosome and makes trna which then goes and gathers amino acids then the amino acids then match up with their corresponding nucleotides. 
23186	5	0	0	Ribosomes start making the protein. 
23187	5	0	0	Dumps off the information it is carrying. Then trna. And rrna which creates ribosomes.

23194	5	0	0	Unwanted parts of the sequence are destroyed. Then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed. After the opposite strand is made, they form a polypeptide. The poly peptide begins to coil and twist together. As its coiling, it is bonded to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mrna in segments of three. Then, the protein is assembled. 
23195	5	0	0	And then split several times again. Then the full strand is split, and both strands go to the ribosomes. 
23196	5	0	0	Gets ripped apart then traslation when things occur in the nucleus. When the trna foes back to the nucleus. The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next step is when the mrna goes out and gives the code to something else. That blue print is then taken to make protiens. 
23197	5	0	0	Anticodon that matches its codon.3. The trna brings the rna to the with directions to copy the stand, trna which will transfer the rna to the animo acid sequence of a protein. Rrna combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to build the protein number back up. 
23198	5	0	0	Strand and makes the protiens to match the sequence
23199	5	0	0	Then delivers the dna to another nucleus. The dna is made into rna, then the protein will synthesize.

23451	5	0	0	Acid comes in and attatches itself with the mrna. The trna goes back to nucleus
23452	5	0	0	Then attaches to rrna, ribosomal rna, transfering rna, and takes it to the ribosomes to leave the cell. The fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after (:
23453	5	0	0	Transfers its infornmation to the organelle. The organelle will read the anticodon and match it with the proper codon on the mrna. The third step is translation. This step is important because the mrna goes through the dividing wall and into the trna and into a section of the dna. Dna getting transfered. Dna getting paired with a new strand.

23472	5	0	0	Which is when the dna spilts and forms a rna strand on the cytoplasm. In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will go to a different cell to do reproduction. Also when it leaves it has to get use it being gone.2) is they have to work to regain it back.3)is when they are starting to regain it they have to store it.4) is when they get it stored they have to make new copies of the information to put for trna. Then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the trna are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien. 
23473	5	0	0	And then put to work throughout the cell, collect things from each part of the cell it starts making proteins for the cell. The third step is  when the trna comes upon a stop codon, the process starts again
23474	5	0	0	Matches the codon to the ribosome and then trna comes and connects with the ribosome and then turns into a trna. From there, the information is passes to a trna which is then used in making proteins. Now begins the step of protein synthesis. 
23475	5	0	0	The mrna then enters the mitochondria where it is transformed into rna
23476	5	0	0	Make and then the dna gets a new code, and if there is a mutism in there then that will happen, then the cell gets ready to dived with interphase, ten the cell starts to seperate with interphase, then the protein will make its way to the nucleus. Trna starts. Grna starts. Rrna starts. ?

23479	5	0	0	It where the broken dna strand is. Then it goes to trna and the trna takes and makes the new strand. The rrna sends the trna to get transfered onto the rna sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids. This step is important because the mrna goes through the nuclear pores and delivers the message to the right place in the cell. 
23480	5	0	0	Then moved out of the cell4)develers the message
23481	5	0	0	Pieces are added to the seqence. Next the mrna carries the information to the other parts of the cell move. Anaphase is where the chromosomes line up. Anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus, it meets up with the trna.

Atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction. The trna keeps connecting to mrna to make amino acids. Then the rrna comes along. The rrna links all of the information together. 
23499	5	0	0	Produce oxygen which is released into the body where they are needed. 
23500	5	0	0	Strand and then moves to the cell. 
23501	5	0	0	Goes through the golgi apparadus then through the endoplasmic reticulum then into out the cell membrane
23502	5	0	0	Parts of the body. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. Second, it brings them back to the ribosomes and get the proteins to take it where it needs to go. 
23503	5	0	0	This step to create the correct amino acid for that certain codon.3. The trna continues to read the mrna. The trna the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which is given back to the nucleus to produce the protein. 
23504	5	0	0	When the mrna releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mrna in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the stand of dna starts to unravel. From there the trna will transform into a cell, two is crossing over, movement, mitosis, meosis, osmosis
23505	5	0	0	Nucleus and trna steps in to translate the sequence-rrna create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acids-the sequence is let out of the cell-it goes off into the cytoplasm and proteins connect to the mrna at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids, and i do not know the rest. 
23506	5	0	0	To give amino acids to trna which then goes to rrna goes to grna
23507	5	0	0	A strand of mrna can be translated several times. 
23508	5	0	0	Moves along the mrna like a zipper and copies the code making it a new strand of nucleotides. Step 4: the mrna matches up with its trna and the nucleotides make a protein. 
23509	5	0	0	It will go through translation where the mrna is copied, then amino acids from to the strand. 
23510	5	0	0	This happens they convert the mrna to amino acids and it goes down the strand one by one till it reaches the stop codon. This happens continuously to make proteins. The trna brings the rna to the rrna. The rrna completes the assembly. Finally, it gets the right amino acids. The last step is the making of a proteine
23511	5	0	0	Travels to  the endoplasmic recticulum where it is used to make an rna strand with the trna. Then trna tranfers the information. While this is happening, the mrna takes the dna segment to the ribosomes. Secondly, the strand goes to a ribosome. The ribosome attaches to the mrna.3. Trna translates the mrna into a dna sequence.4. This dna sequence is what is used to make copies of the dna. After that then the body sends out the proper proteins. Lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again. 
23512	5	0	0	Begin to insert itself into the dna and make a bopy of itself in it. Afterwards it will remove itself and move on to another dna strand. 
23513	5	0	0	Trna then from there the trna comes into play and then it goes in and looks for any missing parts or if the letters got switched around to fix it. 
23514	5	0	0	Last step is finished to form and pass on the protein. 
23515	5	0	0	That make it a useful organism for the cell, it goes out into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes. The ribosomes finish the process of protein synthesis
23516	5	0	0	Then the dna that was made is trasfered by trna and he transferes it to rna so that rrna can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the proteinribosomes (rrna)- assemble the proteintrna- transfers the protein to that cell. 
23517	5	0	0	Into another language that the mrna understands. The strand is then transcribed, turned into an amino acid. More trna then comes and repeats the whole process. The mrna takes the information to make a amino acid. This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain. After a new amino     this then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain. Once the trna have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be checked for errors. Once the trna have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons. The codons in the mrna. The third step is translation. The fourth step is metaphase. The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next step is to divided the atp's. After that, the dna is rezipped. 
23518	5	0	0	Telling it what its new match will be, switching the a's to u's. T's go with a's g's with c's and visversa except the a will switch to a u instead of a t. This is call metophase. After they replicate one set of the genetic information goes back into the nucleus. 
23519	5	0	0	Acids have to leave the nucleus to make protein synthesis. The last part is where it becomes rrna and helps the ribosomes, the part of the cell it starts making proteins for the cell. 
23520	5	0	0	And leaves the cell in order to go get what ever the cell needs to live. 
23521	5	0	0	Nucleus four major things happen with protien synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, and finding the protein

23523	5	0	0	Ribezomes compress what is left down. Secondly the ribezomes compress what is left down. Then at that place it makes some protein. The next step is the mrna gets its second strand. The mrna get the orders to go to the cell. Getting rid of all the bad proteins. Then, the trna floats away to find another amino acid to carry. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, giving that cell the rna
23524	5	0	0	To rrna then the codons are decoded and changed in to aminoacids. 
23525	5	0	0	More and new dna. 
23526	5	0	0	Outside the nucleus to be matched with a ribosome2. The ribosome latches on to an amino acid.3. The dna is being replicated, when rrna is being produced, then it builds a second strand to make the proteins. 
23527	5	0	0	Then is will be taken to where it can get energy. They it goes back to nucleus. The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are, mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the golgi apparatus. Then goes to the golgi apparatus. Then the protein is sent it off into the cell. 
23528	5	0	0	Synthesis goes from rrna to rna to dna to protein. 
23529	5	0	0	Rna delivering the coded information needed

23532	5	0	0	It then travels throughout the body. 
23533	5	0	0	The ribosomes to start trna where they translate the message. Then the mrna take that information and arrange the proteins accordingly. 
23534	5	0	0	Is exchanged to make protein. The next step is translation. The fourth step, the polishing of the protein, the protein is taken my trna back to the nucleus as trna and reattaches itself with the mrna strand. Trna balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein. 
23535	5	0	0	Mucleus starts doing its job. Therefore the body gets what it needs. 
23536	5	0	0	Nucleus with instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids.

23538	5	0	0	To the cells membrane. Then the rnas can go to the ribosomes where a protein attaches forming trna
23539	5	0	0	Proteins to the spot that the area is low on proteins. Then rrna helps the proteins break down3. The trna transports the proteins to and from cells.4. Cell walls allow the protein inside for use. 
23540	5	0	0	And then becomes a trna. From there, the golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell. Trna brings amino acids with complementary codons to attach     then the er takes it to the cell membrane. 2. Gets copied and attached again
23541	5	0	0	Isemerging with a cell. The mrna will go back to the nucleus.

23837	5	0	0	Step which almost finishes protein synthesis. They are then held together by a peptide bondthe trna discinnectsthe amino acids leave the nucleus to do its job
23838	5	0	0	Coded for a protein. All these steps put together allows protein synthesis to occur. 
23839	5	0	0	Takes it to its distenation
23840	5	0	0	Going into the blood stream. The third step, the trna is copied into a complimentary rrna. The codons are read on the mrna strand, with code instructions. 
23841	5	0	0	 they make a new strand
23842	5	0	0	Not sure about the other ones. 
23843	5	0	0	Is then paired with the opposite nucleic materialsthen its 'copied and pasted'
23844	5	0	0	And complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mrna gets copied, and is lead to the golgi body. The blocks then go the where the body mostly needs it. Mrnd is the diliverer from the dna. The mrna takes this section to trna to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis. 
23845	5	0	0	The mrna will come to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. It then goes to the ribosomes gets protein then goes to the golgi apparatus. Then the mrna goes to other cells in the organism and does what it had to to in the nucleus
23846	5	0	0	Then taken to make protiens. 
23847	5	0	0	The two then lock in with one another. 
23848	5	0	0	A message that tells the other types of rna what they will be doing. It creates a blue print for trna. Trna is the transfer rna. And rrna makes ribosomes for the cell. After that it gets copied and creates a new, complimentary strand of rna. 
23849	5	0	0	Mrna gives the messages to the grna. The grna then make a gentic code. 
23850	5	0	0	Is where they are taken from one place to another for protein synthesis. 
23851	5	0	0	The ribosome with a message to make proteins. The cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created. 
23852	5	0	0	When read stand for one amino acid ( amino acid- the building blocks for proteins) as the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome disconnects from the mrna strand and the protein is formed from this information. 
23853	5	0	0	Interfase is prophase which is the first stade of meiosis. The second step of this is when the mitochondria takes all the proteins in the body and packages them up and ships them somewhere else. Then the trna turns these codes into rna codes. From there the trna comes into play, trna takes the proteins and delivers them to the endoplasmic reticulum and to a ribosome, and then leaves the nucleus. The mrna travels trough the cytoplasm. Third, the codons form proteins. 
23854	5	0	0	Chain to then be transfered back into the dna sequence. 
23855	5	0	0	The mrna that takes to the original rna and makes everything right agian
23856	5	0	0	Them each a condon. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mrna strand. 
23857	5	0	0	Then goes though sythesis. Which then is creates protein synthesis. 
23858	5	0	0	Which get the body started. Then proteins combine with nucleic acids to make dna sequences for the new dna. Ionic bonds are made between each protein. 
23859	5	0	0	The nucleus involved in protein synthesis. They are making the proteins snythesis with each other. Step 1: to arrive where the proteins are2: brake the proteins up3: conncet proteins again with rna 4: the process is complete
23860	5	0	0	 each codon codes for an aminno acid and then the amino acids will be assembled into proteins. 
23861	5	0	0	To form polypeptide bonds between the amino acids. Then, it must find a copy of another rna to link it with the other. Finally, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. 
23862	5	0	0	And move on to another dna strand. 
23863	5	0	0	And into the blood. The protiens copy themselves and create amino acids. Mrna leaves the nucleus with the dna information because dna can't leave the nucleus. Then it is stored
23864	5	0	0	Read and coppied into dna. The dna then sends out coding for the process as well. Protein synthesis is a very complicated process. 
23865	5	0	0	Throughout the body sending the message to the cells stating the problemrrna-replicates the cellstrna-transfers the messagegrna-gets all of them together
23866	5	0	0	Up of amino acids that make a protein. The codons attach to the anticodons of the trna strand. Then it gets paired and is protein
23867	5	0	0	The trna goes to the ribosome3.       Lysosome. 
23868	5	0	0	For just about anything. But they can also be transferred back to the nucleus. 
23869	5	0	0	Is where the strand is straightened out. Peeling: this is where the strand is straightened out. Peeling: this is where the mrna goes to the rrna to tell it to make protien. The message in the rna is seen by the ribosomes. 
23870	5	0	0	Begin to be ensembled in the correct part of the cell and for the nucleic acid sequence of a protein. 
23871	5	0	0	Leaves the area it began, it mutates, it forms new cells. 
23872	5	0	0	The first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. The trna then brings the rna strand to an mrna strand and makes proteins from there. 
23873	5	0	0	 then bracking down, and forming nutrients to protein
23874	5	0	0	A chain by peptide bonds. 
23875	5	0	0	Dothen the mrna is used to duplicate in the cell membrane
23876	5	0	0	Information goes back into the nucleus and break down
23877	5	0	0	 the mrna continue this process until the full strand of dna is unzipped. Then the chain of amino acids creates a protein. 
23878	5	0	0	Nucleus is goes through the blood stream. The third step, the trna is copied into a smaller form called messanger rna or mrna and then that travels around and is involved in a process known as protein synthesis. 
23879	5	0	0	Our dna and lastly it is changed into protein. 
23880	5	0	0	The cell knows what to code for the proteins
23881	5	0	0	 the newly formed mrna branches away from the stand of dna starts to unravel. From there, a ribosome attaches to the mrna.3. The trna comes and joins to gether with it for a little whils then the trna leaves. The trna brings over the amino acid that matches with the anticodon that it's carrying. One
23882	5	0	0	Itself from the nucleus and gives to it to the amino acids. The amio acids on the trna form peptide bonds with the other amino acids in the ribosome.4.  It then forms a new strand of rna together and sends the protein out to where it's needed. 
23883	5	0	0	Site of protein synthesis is rer. 
23884	5	0	0	Synthesis will take place. Then transfer rna decodes, and sends the information to have rrna take place. 
23885	5	0	0	Trys to find the minerals they need. If those cant be found they use  photosynthesis to get the mineralsthe body finally makes the proteins it needs. 
23886	5	0	0	  protein synthesis is complete. 
23887	5	0	0	Be on at a time.4)once the new protein is formed. 
23888	5	0	0	Acids being apart of it and helping us have what we need to survive. 
23889	5	0	0	Goes and transfers the message to the mambrane. Then the amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids that are made up of amino acids that are made up of dna. 
23890	5	0	0	Acids and takes them to the ribosome.3. It forms rrna and begins binding the amino acids in the ribosome.4.  It then forms a new strand of rna to a new location where it is then used as needed. 
23891	5	0	0	Floating bases around them. The ribosomes create the needed proteins. 
23892	5	0	0	Mrna has taken the information to its destination, trna then takes place to bring the correct amino acids to create a sequence.3) the sequence is coded by the trna.4) proteins are made. 
23893	5	0	0	 trna transfers it over to mrna, which gives the message of genes to the rrna, which carries instructions from the nucleus from the animo acid sequence of a protein. 
23894	5	0	0	Information it will start making protiens and their codons. After codons and proteins are made the cell now has new dna. 
23895	5	0	0	And then attaches to rrna, or a ribosome, then trna transports the things to the golgi where its packaged and distrubuted by rrna. 
23896	5	0	0	Its job and the trna takes it to the nuclues and then the process starts again. 
23897	5	0	0	And the good is then taken to the amino acids for different uses
23898	5	0	0	Make sure that it kill off the bad things
23899	5	0	0	 coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid code that is to be made. By the end of the sequence is reached, and a trna links up with the ribosom/mrna to make a specific protien, the protien is produced, from the nucleus the first step includes the mrna attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.4) there the proteins are synthesized. 
23900	5	0	0	Side of the nucleus, it moves across the cell membrane to preform this action. Three: turn the energy into protein. 
23901	5	0	0	Prosperous and fulfilling one. 
23902	5	0	0	Proteins are used for energy in the cell. The next step is translation. The fourth step, the creation of the protein, trna allows for the protein th tanscribe, rrna creates the dna in the rna, form amino acids, then the cell divides into two identical daughter cells that both contain the same sequence of rna. The ribosome takes three mrna at a time and the trna then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids.4. The chain of amino acids. 
23903	5	0	0	The dividing wall and into the trna and into a section of the dna. A will become u, t will become a, c will become g, and g will become c. After the mrna finds a ribosome and attaches itself to the mrna2.the mrna takes the trna to the rrna where they become a protein. 
23904	5	0	0	Where the chromosomes line up. Anaphase is where the chromosomes go off into groups, and telophase. In the process of termination and goes into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid code that is needed to make proteins. After this is done trna is helping produce atp for protiens. After transcription occurs translation begins to decode the rna that has been made. After this has been done the rna then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens. 
23905	5	0	0	Transports the information to genes. 
23906	5	0	0	 the rrna then codes what the mrna said. 
23907	5	0	0	Now done its job and the trna takes over. The trna leaves the ribosomes and goes to the nucleous. Step three: i dont know
23908	5	0	0	 then goes to the brain giving the brain the message it needs and the brain sends out organisms to fight it. The fighters destroy it. 
23909	5	0	0	For the proteins and makes them. Then the mrna travels to the mitochondria.4. Protein synthesis is completed when the mrna leaves the nucleus. During translation, the information is passes to a trna which is then used in making proteins. The four major steps are prophase, anaphase, and telephase. Those are four major steps involved in protein synthesis. Then it gets more sugars to multiply the strands. Mrna then goes and copies itself. Then the rrna will hold it together. Then you have a protein

23923	5	0	0	Sure the mrna makes new rna to get through the life cycle
23924	5	0	0	The 4th one would be that mrna would go through the nucleus and travel through the cytoplasm. In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will then pass it to the grna which is the last step in protein synthesis is rrna making the proteins. It eventually gets made into peptide chains and during this step the proteins add on to the peptide chain making it grow. Termination- the mrna tells the trna to stop decoding.
