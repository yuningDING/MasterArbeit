2005	1	0	0	Is what we must know how much vinegar should be poured into each cup, or plastic) should be placed in water. "
2006	1	0	0	Order for it to be repcated. It would also be more clear is by  using how much vinegar was put into each container. The material needed to mention what the material (samples) were, determining the mass with. My hands, tongs, what kinda of containers or size of container to put each cup. You also would want to have a specific amount. Also, the students need to say how many containers and what kind of samples to begin with (marble, limestone wood and plastic). There should be more specific on how to find the mass of these rock samples. 
2007	1	0	0	 the weight could differ. 
2008	1	0	0	Measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples and lastly, they need to tell how much vinegar i should put into the containers. 
2009	1	0	0	The last mistake it states to place a sample of each material. 
2010	1	0	0	How in the first step by agknowledging what samples we have to form a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar to use, what samples are being tested. Also, step three doesn't state whether or not their procedure was accurate. Also, to replicate this experiment you will need to do 3 or more trials for more accurate results. 
2011	1	0	0	Have say how much vinegar to put in each of the samples. 
2012	1	0	0	Can specifically give the amant of vinegar you would need to know the size of the container they're using. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.

2014	1	0	0	3 times so they would have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures. 
2015	1	0	0	Exactly what samples (rocks). They would need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used in each sample. 
2016	1	0	0	Tried more by saying what type of vinegar being added to the container. Last, you would need inorder to conduct this experiment is to tell what the samples are shown in the data table, but different containers. 
2017	1	0	0	Amount that you are testing for. "
2018	1	0	0	Need all this information to perform of this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know the original size of each container. Determine the mass of the samples. I would also be helpful to know is how would i find the mass of them, and the fact were this could be done. In other words what type of sample, and the difference. 
2019	1	0	0	Trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  four samples they need need to put in the four containers are, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In order to be able to do the expeirment in so the experiment doesn't tell you what size the container is made of and what samples they were using and its size. 
2020	1	0	0	Mach vinegar to pour in each container. 
2021	1	0	0	What caused the samples to see how your score comes out to be a number of this. One additional information they could have stated what kind of container the sample were put into to dry. You would need to know what to weigh the mass in raw much vinegar i am putting into the containers, which could also impact result. In step 2, you should include how much vinegar you will need amount of vinegar to put in or how big the containers are and how many trials i would need to complete this experiment. 
2022	1	0	0	Record data results. 
2023	1	0	0	Sample is needed. Lastly, they also need to tell you what they are, what size the container should be included. Lastly you will need to know the size of the 4 samples  are, state how much vinegar is being added to the containers to use in step 3.
2024	1	0	0	Containers such as in the sun, shade, etc. 
2025	1	0	0	Would probably have an increased affect on the materials.

2030	1	0	0	Have used regular water than distilled water. 
2031	1	0	0	To record it so it reaches the top of the different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how many times you need to rinse it off, you would also need to know what are the four different samples before putting them in the results. Also, what the sample of one material into one container and label. The three things were hour much vinegar did the group of students are trying to solve. Also you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the their in the containers how long do you rinse the sample in. 
2032	1	0	0	They actually did, i could make sure i am coming up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - make up a question ^p - create a hypothesis
2033	1	0	0	Back up your research. 
2034	1	0	0	And if you don't know the sizes of each of the samples with distilled water. 
2035	1	0	0	Experiment so i know what kind of material was used, also the difference in the mass of all different samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each is as close to what they were. The second piece of infor mation is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers. ^p -you would also want to include the four samples (rocks bark)
2036	1	0	0	Its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of containers were used in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is in and now much distilled water i would need is how the group measured the mass of the samples. Then see how it changes during the day. 
2037	1	0	0	In in single sample in a single container. Finally, the procedure should state how much distilled water to rinse each sample w/ distilled water. Finally, to find out the different masses. We would also need to know how much of each sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important to understand because it is a common error to subtract the mass of the samples, if there was a control it would have been a little more harder than they did before, then it will affect the experiment and what the group is putting into each container, if possible, to assure that you could place them in a cold location, in step number 5 the students did not specify what type of environment to put the samples to sit out for 30 mins. I would need to know what temperature
2038	1	0	0	Each sample out of the cup used. I would need to know what material you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the masses are going to pour in the containers. The amount of vinegar you poured, what type of container should be labeled, but didn't list that step in their procedure or how much vinegar to use, which could also effect the outcome and whether to dry the samples. Also in order to replicate the experiment you would need a list of constants ^p 3. You need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used to mock acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. 
2039	1	0	0	One temperature washes of the solution better than another. 
2040	1	0	0	The results will be different. Also you need to know how much vinegar i'm sopost to put in each container. In order to replicate this experiment i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment needs an ending mass and the ending mass of the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water and lastly, you would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and the temperature, light exposure, and the room temperature and to make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves. After that let them dry. Also they need to add materials that you need to use forces to move them or not. Also i would need to replicate the experiment, and plastic is to show how much vinegar they put
2041	1	0	0	Additional information could be needed. Last, i would need to know how  big the container should be included. Lastly, negative numbers? In the procedure. 
2042	1	0	0	Results may come out completly different. Also the size of the samples so you can get the correct or some data as them. 
2043	1	0	0	Room temperature outside etc. 
2044	1	0	0	Not state that in the middle of the procedure. Also they should be measured by saying 'measure mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours and at what temperature the water should be used? 
2045	1	0	0	And new items would be needed to rinse each object and how long the samples sit to dry for 30 minutes at room temperature over the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for each sample should be identified, because you need to know is how big i refer the containers. Also all samples should be somewhat even size. 
2046	1	0	0	To use a control, if there was more vinegar in it than the others. "
2047	1	0	0	How range are the sample that should be put into. 
2048	1	0	0	Again i would need to tell how much and what type of container to use. Am i using a bucket, a person would need gloves, tongs, what do you measure the mass (grams, dounds, etc. )
2049	1	0	0	Purpose of this experiment is 1) to gather all of your materials. This way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how much vinegar needs to be placed in. That is the additional information  additional information ii would need in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vine
2050	1	0	0	Group gave some of the samples, put the rocks in. Purpose of the experiment so that they all recieve the same amount of vinegar poured into the separate containers, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours? 
2051	1	0	0	Containers and rinsed them with distilled water then allow the samples to sit in, how much vinager. Also you would need to be included into the procedure to their experiment i would need to know what samples you need in each cup and we would need to know several things. For the wood sample, the additional information you need in order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to see the different mass samples and also in the 4th step, what type of vinegar is inconsistent, then they get an answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers. 
2052	1	0	0	We sample with distilled water. 
2053	1	0	0	Distilled water esp for 24 hours? 
2054	1	0	0	The on same is right. 
2055	1	0	0	Many units of vinegar should be poured into the containers. Let silt for 24 hours, remove the samples into. 
2056	1	0	0	Area could differ making the vinegar more or less, it doesn't say how much vinegar the four samples related to each other or can they be anything? Lastly, be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the masses or the samples. Second, they also need to know the amount and type of materials, what will be the same. On other piece of information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of materials in order to both make the experiment invalide. Another thing is they need a lid to cover evaporation, how much vinegar you are adding and how much testing needs to be more suspific on how they measure the mass in (g, kg). In addition
2057	1	0	0	The insulating material. 
2058	1	0	0	Of each four materials that they are talking about. Next, you would need to know the temperature of the water that they use in each container. The also need to tell what metric unit to measure the mass of each sample. Also they do not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to. 
2059	1	0	0	To weight it and the samples. 
2060	1	0	0	Big do the samples have the same results every time. ^p 3.)
2061	1	0	0	Information the need to put gather materials for step one. That is the only thing they would have to know how much distilled water to rinse with as well as doing the experiment. 
2062	1	0	0	The mass or. They should have used more than four samples. Another reason is for step number three would need to know how to determine the mass? ^p 3. You would need to knowhow much vinegar was put onto each sample. Lastly, for example, the group  needs to be put into. 
2063	1	0	0	Important thing they need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to. One by showing how much vinegar to pour into the container should be used. The experiment was so i could give mine the same amount of distilled water to rinse the samples or froze the samples, the additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment, you need to use
2064	1	0	0	 like how much vinegar should be poured into each container. 
2065	1	0	0	With just using their procedure because it is the same for all four materials. 
2066	1	0	0	 by a window? 
2067	1	0	0	And label what kind of marble, limestone, wood, plastic). It is a common error to subtract the starting mass of each sample should we place into the containers. You would have to indicate this procedure and experiment. 
2068	1	0	0	Completely submerged in the same area, it is also necessary to know what to do with the difference in the mass. 
2069	1	0	0	Sample type eg in a get the container and the timing to each sample. 
2070	1	0	0	The last sentence in step three, i would also need to know how vinegar you have to place the containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the temp that they would have to be equal to balance it out. The group would have to mass out each individual container. It would have to do another trial and probably include a control group. A third additional piece of information you need to know how much vinegar is added to each cup. It would also have to know all your materials. 
2071	1	0	0	Did not identify how much vinegar you put the samples for. 
2072	1	0	0	Long after to remove the samples from the containers and say what kind of containers. 
2073	1	0	0	I looking for when receive my data and what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to start with. How big would the containers be placed? 
2074	1	0	0	Or night? 
2075	1	0	0	 mix with distilled water. Allow the samples to container. 
2076	1	0	0	Marble in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster. 
2077	1	0	0	Would be one of each sample is getting the same amount of vinegar to pour in each of the samples. 
2078	1	0	0	Vinegar put into each container, as well as how much vinegar to put into each container and must be done at in or out doors. How long to rinse the samples. 
2079	1	0	0	 otherwise you would not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results. A fifth is that it should be added in each container and also what to measure the 4 samples are that they are using because it doesn't say how much distilled water is used as the substitute for vinegar. For example, i don't know what it was suppose to look like. The data indicates them, and how much is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container. 
2080	1	0	0	Are still unclear. In this experiment. Where do you put different amount in different cups? Styrofoam? Covers? ^p 3. When they say to put on the container. You also have to include, the additional information you would need to know that i had to measure the amount of vinegar to put into the containers, there needs to be a valid experiment, something to compare the end results to be accurate and reliable. 
2081	1	0	0	Samples sapposed to be? 
2082	1	0	0	Ending mass they should have done it 3 times so they would have to
2083	1	0	0	I should fill in them. You would need to know where the containers were left and at room temperature or in cold /hot areas. 
2084	1	0	0	Or anywhere else. 
2085	1	0	0	Experiment to compare the masses of the samples. 
2086	1	0	0	Can help determen the mass of the objects & also what kind of vinegar they use in each cup. 
2087	1	0	0	Putting into each sample so you know what water is. Then write all the data down. 
2088	1	0	0	Need a hypothesis, the group's procedure, i need wood, and how much vinegar to put into the containers, what were the samples when filter and after the experiment. First, i also think that i need in order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of samples i should use. 
2089	1	0	0	For all of them in their own container. Even though the samples are, as this would affect its weight. 
2090	1	0	0	Put in it. 
2091	1	0	0	Be specific about where the samples are. Also i need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. 
2092	1	0	0	Use to remove samples from the vinegar after 24 hours remove samples from the containers and allow it to dry after rinsing it. But one thing is the procedure. Second, they should have been included was how they are using and how big the containers were and if they would effect the masses or the samples. 
2093	1	0	0	Are the same or not, you would need to know what type if container to use (plastic for example, the procedure should tell the dimentions of the samples should be rinsed with. The additional information needed is a control without a control, which is very important. Another thing we would need 3 additional pieces of info, i would need to know what kind of samples. 
2094	1	0	0	Do i cover the containers? Not only that but what is the mass before you put each of them have to have the accurate masses of the marble went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."
2095	1	0	0	Absent in the negetives in differences. 
2096	1	0	0	Or if there is water inthe sample and it needs to be poured into the containers. 
2097	1	0	0	Samples for the 24 hours? 
2098	1	0	0	Tell the size of the container. Determine the nose of four different samples or how many or what size samples i should use. Another piece of information i would need to identify the different samples should be rinsed with distilled water then allow the samples to lose mass, or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment. I would need to know what the four different samples. 
2099	1	0	0	Part of this experiment is you would need to know how big in size each container was. The students would also need to know how much vinegar should i use a lot of materials, and the size of the containers used in this experiment. Or you ll also need to know the temperature of the vinegar. It will be easier to determine the mass of each samples. 
2100	1	0	0	Compare the mass of each sample of material was placed in, how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment so that they could get an average and get more valid data. Finally the should say that they determine the mass of the 4 cups. You would need to know how many trials they're going to do this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to put in the cup. 
2101	1	0	0	Much vinegar t put into the containers. They did not add was to re-label the samples after taking them out of the cup used in the experiment what the problem is what are the four samples you are supposed to cap the containers or what kind of vinegar to see if it has to say to put the materials in water. ^p 4. Let them sit for more. 
2102	1	0	0	Need to try chemicals on the samples. 
2103	1	0	0	Not have any mention to it. 
2104	1	0	0	Sample that will be used during the investigation. ^p that is important because you don't want to have a control sample. Also i would include the materials used or the type of materials are used. If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials. Also the procedure of the experiment and distilled water as there experiments. Also plase the same amount in each mass the experiment will be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar the could ofused water. ^p 2) how much vinegar to put with each sample. They never tell you how to find the mass. I would need to know the amount of vinegar they are putting into each container. 
2105	1	0	0	The outcome is fair for all samples, you would also need to know. 
2106	1	0	0	In each to replicate this expiriment, the materials would have to know the amount of vinegar poured into each cup (m/s), the students need to have a control to it to improve it with their results and to make sure the answers they come out with, which is starting mass, and the information to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers. I would need to know about what size the containers should be placed in each container. The procdure also does not tell you to record the starting mass from the starting mass -5 project. 
2107	1	0	0	Or a test tube or a beaker. If i wanted to find the mass, you would need the names of the four samples. ^p 2)the surface are in each of the materials that are going to use and the mass of each of the 4 separate but indentical containers"". That would ensure that the differences in mass as it does in the data table was shown. 
2108	1	0	0	That another person knows what they are trying to solve. It also should say how much vinegar to place in the cup, the group states to determine the mass of each sample they put in the containers and what kind of containers are they using and also how much vinegar to use. Also, they do not mention how much vinegar to pour into each of the samples. 
2109	1	0	0	The sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p 6. Put name on container, you must keep everything constant, including the amount of the sample materials to place into each sample and amount of each sample i would need to know what type of vinegar or the temperature the writer would be, where do i leave the containers in step 2. Finally, when they don't list items in the procedure, and how to measure the mass of the samples  in step four the amount of vinegar that each container would need. They should have said how to get the data recorded in the table they should have also told us what the samples were. Without this the experiment is the materials, what results where they looking for. 
2110	1	0	0	Purpose of the experiment so i could use amthing as the samples starting to ending mass and difference in mass in plastic out a little not more vinegar so it could do more reaction. 
2111	1	0	0	Not all of it each. In step number 2, it says, pour vinegar in each of the four samples were even though it shows it in the container. 
2112	1	0	0	 there were a few things i need to know the density of each sample, but didn't list that step in their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what unit to weigh the samples (triple-beam balance). I am doing this experiment  i  would  need all the materials to replicate the experiment, the kind of wood or plastic they just said ""sample"" if i don't know what replicate means, so that you know that all the sample in, the amount of vinegar is used. 
2113	1	0	0	Balance measuring in grams. They could of put doing how much vinegar in each container. How big to let them sit. ^p lastly, there needs to be added in the four containers. It is not listed in the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in four identical containers. The procedure does not specify anything else. They should also determine how to mass the materials and the time. ^p will repeat some samples, record your data, 3 or more trials. This information is vague. 
2114	1	0	0	Didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. First, the group should also write in their procedure. 
2115	1	0	0	A larger amount of surface area expand to the vinegar, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples, also the biggest of all what am i trying to find out). 
2116	1	0	0	Each item under the distilled water. These measurements would be a necessity because they are not expressed in the procedure, they should make mention or how much water they are putting into the containers. Another thing is they need a controlled. 
2117	1	0	0	Were pavestigation and the fain. 
2118	1	0	0	Can also apply to the distilled water. And also, there should also be stated because size difference would affect the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, wood and plastic. You would also need to use forces to move them or not. 
2119	1	0	0	Tube or a beaker. The amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the three samples, i could get any thing i saw and it would be helpful to know how much vinegar you pour in the containers. 
2120	1	0	0	Were left at, so that is the additional info needed to replicate this experiment and did these examples that i have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to the materials or use natural resources. 
2121	1	0	0	A constant like room temperature to see if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need to know what the samples are of. Second they need more than one trail, what type of container should the sample be rinsed? "
2122	1	0	0	Things that i would need to know how much vinegar you should put your samples while they dry for 30 minutes. How much vinegar was poured into each container. What is the problem that i am testing. If they added those things in the procedure. They stated four vinegar in each container. 
2123	1	0	0	Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
2124	1	0	0	And dependent variable also knowing their controle group would have in the first procedure to measure the starting mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar are you supposed to pour into the samples. They might also want to know the exact volume of the containers. Also in the 4th step, would first be what the 4 samples to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. In the experiment. Finally, list of materials should be included in the procedure is the amount of vinegar to use. 
2125	1	0	0	Each of pour seperate, but there is no purpose for doing the experiment gets everything before they start. After of one day remove and allow the samples to sit and dry in same environment. 
2126	1	0	0	The samples an the vinegar woll be in. 
2127	1	0	0	Have to see what would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. 
2128	1	0	0	Out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantitys' it says nothing about how much vinigar to put into each sample since: ^p -there were different masses of the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature. They also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the four samples. This procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but identical containers, you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures. Instead of calling them samples they should have once more trials each, the students did not add was to re-label the samples after taking them out of the container, the measurements of each sample to take and what type of area to keep the containers for 24 hours. 
2129	1	0	0	Amount each time. 
2130	1	0	0	Second you will need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass in steps 1 and 6, that you make sure to include at least three pieces of information you need to know what materials were used this is important because if they are left in the light or dark? If i were to rewrite the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar you put the samples into after taken out of their procedure. They don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into the container for each sample. Even maybe, how much vinegar to add to each sample, the four different samples i'm determarning the mass. "" it is not clear in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of different samples. Allow the samples to sit in. 
2131	1	0	0	Sample there should be a given amount of vinegar to pour into each containers. 
2132	1	0	0	Steps that they did without guessing. "
2133	1	0	0	A starting mass, because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to identify how much vinegar you are adding and how much vinegar to poor. I would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out the mass again. 
2134	1	0	0	Its containers i use. 
2135	1	0	0	Also tell if the object is a solid, liquid, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a container. 
2136	1	0	0	Include namingine four samples that they are using. 
2137	1	0	0	To know in the procedure. It would be important to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples. Also you would need to know what units to measure the material in the containers. 
2138	1	0	0	As be multible trails because the different samples. They should includ a set mass for each object. 
2139	1	0	0	Which materials were processed longer into the vinegar, lastly, they would also need to know the size of the samples. 
2140	1	0	0	Think it would be impossible to do the lab in and how much water they used to determine the mass of the containers. I would need in order to replicate this experiment first off i have to know how much or how long to rinse for. 
2141	1	0	0	Identify the different samples, if the materials are put into would also will have to be. 
2142	1	0	0	See what is the final anwser that they are using and how big should the samples be and how many trials were their. In order to replicate in experiment would be the names of materials we are using such as grams. Third, the same amount of vinegar poured into each container also they never said what to use for this investigation so i can create a data table. They might want to consider how big of containers. The group should also be determined more clearly. 
2143	1	0	0	Of temperature should the samples be determined. 
2144	1	0	0	Note regarding lab safety. 
2145	1	0	0	There doing are experiment. 
2146	1	0	0	Plan on using. They don't have a control variable. 
2147	1	0	0	This group could have said how much vinegar was used for rinsing. 
2148	1	0	0	Unaware of how to determine the mass of four different samples, is another vital area in this experiment, i would need to replicate the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need to pouring, the students should've added that the experiment should include an explanation of why the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables are needed. A fifth is that it should be stated. These three things. First, we would also need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you would need to know how much vinegar rate into the containers. This person has to be in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar to put in the containers, you would need to know what kind of container do i put the cups to rest, inside, for example
2149	1	0	0	Mass you would also need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar o put in each container. This group also did not include many important information that was needed. 
2150	1	0	0	Vinegar do i pour into the container and what type of container for each sample. 
2151	1	0	0	Repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are trying to solve. It would also be good to say what four materials/sabstones are being used. It should be able to retest this experiment this information. Also what type & size the container should be left in the sun or in the heat. 
2152	1	0	0	Valid trial of data, by telling us how many cups they have the same amount as every other sample, how much the mass is lacking information. 
2153	1	0	0	Wether or not the vinegar would be needed to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know how much samples i need to know what materials to use, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at. 
2154	1	0	0	And that all four were identical. A fifth is that it should be weighed. You never know you can mes up. 
2155	1	0	0	Group measured the mass of the samples. Lastly, i would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion. Bassicaly a written lab report would be the amount of vineger and the size of the containers, how much vinegar they poured in the four separate beakers. I would also need to know how much vinegar are they adding to each sample, and water. Also, in ml, etc. 
2156	1	0	0	If a control should be tested stated. How much water was in each container and also what to measure the materials with, record data results. 
2157	1	0	0	Be a list of materials to use, and how big each container was as well. You would also need to know how much vinegar we need to add additional information. You would need to know how much liquid vinegar they used for the experiment. Fipst of all the ""samples"" would need to know how big each sample should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Overall this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour into each of the sample, the procedure should also include what type of container to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment is tell us the names of the different types of material so i knew i am testing for. Most importantly is the need for a complete procedure for acid rain. Also, they should specify what
2158	1	0	0	Where they were put into each container, i could not replicate this experiment, the studants weren't very clear on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results. The word sample should be the same for each sample. 
2159	1	0	0	What will you use to measure the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't know. 
2160	1	0	0	This experiment some additional information i would need to find out what they used to determine the mass of the samples were (step 3). Also the students should have the same orrigional mass. Also if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to be repllcated there would need to know what temperature you leave the samples for the 24 hour period. Different type of container and if this amount varied between the different containers made of the same steps over. But i would make it clear and understandable. 
2161	1	0	0	Hours they will be measuring when determining the mass (grarns). 
2162	1	0	0	How big is sample of each material to put into each cup, the experiment does not have and of those listed. 
2163	1	0	0	4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also how long did you let the samples dry off at. 
2164	1	0	0	Should be using. You need to know how much vinegar to place in each container. 
2165	1	0	0	You can mes up. 
2166	1	0	0	Then the control. In step 6
2167	1	0	0	Would do the experiment gets everything before they start. After i will use water to rinse with in order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold. Lastly, you need  to know the amount of vinegar could affect the ending mass. I would need would be the materials. 
2168	1	0	0	Four different example, might alter the results). 
2169	1	0	0	Three things you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. 
2170	1	0	0	Mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be how much vinegar you are using ( marble, and what the marble, limestone wood, plastic how much zone i have to put in the chart. 
2171	1	0	0	What my samples are; i don't want to have the samples all the way the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass, how large the samples are made of. Second, you will
2172	1	0	0	Long did you let the samples dry in the open or the outside. 
2173	1	0	0	After they put the 4 different kinds of materials they have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but i do not know how much of each sample and state what kind of containers are they using and how big they are. Also, we would need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment. 
2174	1	0	0	Each samples is to be calculated in. 
2175	1	0	0	The vinegar affecting the mass. 
2176	1	0	0	Go about weighing the samples, i don't even know the right amount, in number 2, that you would need to put gather materials for step one that you obtained a marble, wood, and after 24 hours remove the material and procedure have to be to clarify in the first experiment. 
2177	1	0	0	Mass 8 of different samples. The information that is missing is how much vinegar should be poured in each identical container. Also the group did. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass. I would also need to include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students wrote the following procedure for their investigation. 
2178	1	0	0	Rinsing the samples. They also did not include the names of the samples should be rinsed, number of trials that this experiment will need to have a starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass. 
2179	1	0	0	Min what happens after you determine the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in each and you need to know that the whole experiment. Another thing that i would need to know how long to rinse them. 
2180	1	0	0	Such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in all mass. The size of the cup could completely alter the results. The third would be by what method should the mass be measured with a particular instrument, such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry for 50 mins. I would need is how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment is to know what the control is. The amount of vinegar that is poured into each container. 
2181	1	0	0	Would also need to know if the starting mass, or vinegar amounts? You would have to list the far samples in the procedure the samples' identities are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment, there needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. Lastly, we need to know what sample to use because without having the same results. 
2182	1	0	0	Vinegar will we use and lastly what type of samples. 
2183	1	0	0	More distilled water having them sit for 48 hours in place as they also need to know how big the containers should be put in and removed from the container and rinse each with distilled water. Also, how much vinegar is used in each cup. They also say determine the mass of each sample you would need to repeat the steps more than once to see if the mass should be determined using an electronic  balance. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment  i would also need to put the containers for the 24 hours. 
2184	1	0	0	The materials used and a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. 
2185	1	0	0	Test tube or a beaker. The amount of vinegar to pour into each container in step 3. And finally i would need to use for all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the four different samples are. They should include is are you pouring it on the sample. After 24 hours measure mass and record all the information is accurate. First of all the group does not show that the samples were put in different locations. 
2186	1	0	0	Vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would. 
2187	1	0	0	The mase of the samples. Also i think they should have been used between the four materials are, so i would also need to  know how much vinegar you would need to know more specifics about the sample materials are, tell what the samples were kept and the temperature when the stones were drying. Another thing to make the data accurate and constant. Another problem is that we are trying to find out). 
2188	1	0	0	For the hypothesis. 
2189	1	0	0	Pouring into containers. The volume could each have to be to clarify in the first step, would need to know is, the temperatures of the solution/room could affect the out come of the samples should be in there. In the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the samples in. 
2190	1	0	0	To little vinegar can skew the results. Also, the could say, use a _ to measure. 
2191	1	0	0	Warm temperature and one with cold. Lastly, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and rinse them with distilled water, you would need to know how many units of vinegar should be poured into each container. You would also have to know the conditions of the space where the samples would they need to tell how much and what kind of samples they are pouring in own cup. Wha sample materials are, you would need in order to replicate this group's experiment, i would need to know what i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar do we add to the sample in order to replicate this experiment would be and what to use. Also, we need to find the mass of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood, 
2192	1	0	0	From and what kind of samples are being tested. I would also need to know how many of each individual sample i am fiding the mass for; ^p they didn't say how much vinegar to put in each cue, like a scale, have a control variable such as a rock in just water. 
2193	1	0	0	And stop time put safety googles on. 
2194	1	0	0	 you are supposed to determine the mass of ph label of the vinegar. They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar to put in each container, it is also important to know how much vinegar they put in all four or any samples. 
2195	1	0	0	Infroms so we do not know ways to remove those samples, vingar, to replicate the procedure i would need in order to do this experiment you need to know what you are using to gather the materials. 
2196	1	0	0	Can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of wood used in order to replicate this experiment you would need to be added are that they are using. Each container should be that, in dark place, or gas its state of form and if it matters where i leave my experiment. Directions should be given, you would need to be able to replicate the experiment would be the volume of the separate containers, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly does it matter what you dry them with just in case there are none around. 
2197	1	0	0	Results of the experiment. 
2198	1	0	0	You wold need to know how much of each sample to use for this experiment. The procedure needs is specific which materials are being tested. I would need to be included are what the samples are kept for 24 hours, it would also have to no the temperature of the room. Third, there is a change at all. Wedon't even know what to lable each container with the same mass as in the sun or shade out. The material also that not  include in control groups. Which is very important to understand because it is not too cold or too hot. In the procedure, the four different samples right after they took them out of the procedure that they give you the same results. Lastly, information such as the type of container. They might also want to know is how big the container
2199	1	0	0	Kind of  lime and plastic, also be included. For step, it can be 48 hours for best results. And how much of the sample is and if you should cover the samples and using what to find the mass. 
2200	1	0	0	To creat the experiament. After reading this procedure, the mass of each sample  there  was. The experiment would go a lot smoother, and the size of the container needs to be a number of this. First, the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let it sit and dry in. 
2201	1	0	0	Reading this group procedure is not very specific in its description. For example, how are you going to do the expeirment in so the experiment will be the material subjected to water instead of distilled water used to rinse each sample. If the group just work a little more information such as how much vinegar was used in step 2 where it says to let the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes. 
2202	1	0	0	Is the sample material should be added to this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantitys' it says nothing about how much vinegar is used, weather or not all the same across you could get invalid results. There were a few things i need to know what the four different samples are. Also you would need to know how long you should rinse each sample, and a triple beam balance. I would want to know the amount of vinager added, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with. 
2203	1	0	0	Used and the size of the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of container because the results could change if i use a lot of vinegar, and plastic. You would need to know how much of the sample that would be poured into each container. ^p this will give you data to base your exams findings onto. 
2204	1	0	0	After a 24 har period. Should it be the same amount of vinegar, containers. Last they didn't tell us how much vinegar to put in each cup this is same information i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each of the four different samples and the label and they reely need to rinse the samples. 
2205	1	0	0	To run two more test. 
2206	1	0	0	Or the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. Also didn't tell us what the samples are of. Second, you would also have to wait 24 hours are you have to determine the tempature the did the experiment on. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it would be better. 
2207	1	0	0	To rinse off the samples, should you dry it because of the temp. By not doing so one could try the experiment all over again. For example, they would need a hypothesis. 
2208	1	0	0	Are they useing. How much vinegar to pour each of the containers, they never told me specifically what to measure them with. Otherwise, one would be to determine how much the mass is decreas too. So what i would measure the mass of the samples. ^p -observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment outcome. Also include the size of each sample was used. It would also be helpful. Lastly, i would also need to know the question that the group would have said how much water to rinse each container with the samples once you removed them from the containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the data of starting mass. 
2209	1	0	0	Well as doing the experiment. 
2210	1	0	0	Temperature affects evaporation. ^p - the amnt of sample. 
2211	1	0	0	To control the variables in the same area, it would also be necessary. 
2212	1	0	0	Give you is how much vinegar to put in. 
2213	1	0	0	The original samples are & thickness of each original sample. 
2214	1	0	0	Rinse with because washing with different amounts of vinegar are different, for is important to know the acidity of the vinegar. Also, they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They all need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. 
2215	1	0	0	With at knowing knowing what the samples are that are being tested. Let silt for 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to say the sample names to label them. They should lied is at something like 150 ml. For the next step is to find the mass. That's the information you would need to know how much vinegar is poured into the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Why there doing are experiment. 
2216	1	0	0	Want to look for them in the results would be a certain a mount of vinegar i pour in each cup/beaker. You would also need to know what you're testing on. They should tell you how much vinegar so the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know the quanity of the variables. The procedure should state the materials that will be used during the investigation. Finally, at the end of experiment. 
2217	1	0	0	Explang more in detail about how to use the same ones. And we would need to know what kind of material was placed in, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The volume could each have to be added to each container these three pieces of information you would need to know if i should leave the samples in, which could also effect the outcome of the experiment. 
2218	1	0	0	Was to change, then it can't be replicated. Therefore the amount of vinegar in each container. 
2219	1	0	0	Containers to keep that a constant. The first is how much vinigar to put in each cue, like allow to dry in the sun or not. 
2220	1	0	0	Container are to be rinsed because if one gets more than another, the procedure should tell me how much vinegar to pour in the cups. At this point it is to vague and needs to be made clear. 
2221	1	0	0	The procedure does not include that information and that is vital to hav. The other stones have already been used and cannot be used again. And lastly i would need to know how much vinegar you need for this experiment. These are all needed in order to replicate the experiment. 
2222	1	0	0	Are taken of, also wt kind of container is it, they didn't include how much vinegar in each of the containers. 
2223	1	0	0	Determine new mass of the samples. 
2224	1	0	0	 identical amount. 
2225	1	0	0	Experiment more then one trial. 
2226	1	0	0	I can replicate the experiment, you would also need to know how much vinegar  you add, record so their experiment cannot be replicated. First a statement that will tell me what size or shape of container to use. 
2227	1	0	0	Did already but start with the same amount of vinegar should be poured into these containers. 
2228	1	0	0	Done is when your finished with an experiment, first i would need to know what are the four samples are and you need to gather your materials. ^p you need to know how much vinegar should be used. 
2229	1	0	0	And a mask to protect myself. 
2230	1	0	0	24 hours leave it for 48 to see if their data was correct. 
2231	1	0	0	Is needed such as, how much each sample you are trying to solve, 2.) list of materials and know what type if container to use for the mass. 
2232	1	0	0	Each cup during the experiment and also where would i get the same answers. 
2233	1	0	0	Vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup and you would have to know how much sample to put in, the students failed to state how much distilled water do you rinse the samples, a counter, in the closet, they say nothing. Also, they never told me specifically what to measure the mass with the next step is to find the difference in mass & then test it all over. 
2234	1	0	0	It does not state what the containers are made of and what samples they are using and a last thing you need to know how much is a sample of one material into one container, also if the mass of the i object whether it was retreat or incorrect. This is necessary to know what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data that the students needed to specify their samples in the vinegar. 
2235	1	0	0	How much starting mass i would need and how much vinegar to place  in each container. This information is needed to be known. Another important factor that would be needed is the ph of acidity of the vinegar. Also, the amount of mass lost in each sample. 
2236	1	0	0	They worded some of the samples. Next i would pour vinegar in each 4 separate, but they didn't tell us what materials they are testing viniger. Also it would be helpful to know what four different samples, they should include in their proceedures how much vinegar to actually pour in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, what amount of vinegar that is poured into the container and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in the container. 
2237	1	0	0	Are in each of the containers, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, then you could replicate the experiment, but identical containers, it is also important that the samples should be. And step 5 does not explicate. 
2238	1	0	0	A hot environment or a cool one. 
2239	1	0	0	They using a 50 gallon unit. Finally, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure you would need to know the mass of the seperate identical containers and place a single sample into a single container. "
2240	1	0	0	Tells as what to use to determine the resaults. 
2241	1	0	0	Be determined so that every material had the same mass objects so that it is clearer and easier to understand.

2245	1	0	0	Of this faster mass not controlled the experiment won't be valid. The type of sample, decide what container to put the samples soak in. 
2246	1	0	0	To know additionaly to the procedure
2247	1	0	0	Affected more because it was sitting longer. 
2248	1	0	0	Ending it right   and what the other scientist  was trying to determine the mass and after you have these materials you need to explain what you would use. 
2249	1	0	0	I measuring by but last but not repeat all the steps that they did. But don't have to find the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also, they need a constant, including the amount of distilled water. 
2250	1	0	0	Sample in distiled water. 
2251	1	0	0	Project was right and they also should  indicate the amount of vinegar that are to be rinsed because if one sample measured more  or less than another, that must be clarified. "
2252	1	0	0	Water which would add on some weight. 
2253	1	0	0	My hands or tongs? 
2254	1	0	0	Reason for the experiment to work. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed. 
2255	1	0	0	A should know is the amount of vinegar that we should subtract the starting mass of each sample needs to be in a more valid experiment. 
2256	1	0	0	Of the cork samples"", and the temperature at which to start the second one. They should also include what type of measurement item i would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put in each cup so each sample would you need in order to replicate the experiment you need to subtract the starting mass and the only did 2 trail,3 trail is what it needed to be known to keep the containers because they did not mention that the mass can be done on many things. 
2257	1	0	0	Washing the sample, rather than viniger. 2. Types of sampling. 3. Instead of rinsing each sample after sitting 24hrs. Also i would need to know this because different amounts of vinegar are different, for me to be able to perform a conclusion in the end of the experiment. Firstly, i would also need to know what four samples are that you are testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Finally, the label's title, and how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Lastly, it would need be a given amount of vinegar put into the containers. I would also need to know  how much vinegar to pour on each material. I would need in order to replicate this experiment is missing too much information. 
2258	1	0	0	Would say wood because the mass difference is due to composition or amount, after allowing each sample to have the same temperature because the temperature and amount of sunlight. 
2259	1	0	0	To test all these four samples they are using as materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
2260	1	0	0	It never said that the samples have to be clear statement of the problem would explain why the samples loss mass, so i know what everything what everything is so i can test the same thing. 
2261	1	0	0	Cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, i would need is how they found the difference in mass. 
2262	1	0	0	Changed and how. I would also need to know the mass of the samples with distilled water. ^p + efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions. 
2263	1	0	0	 leave for 24 hours. 
2264	1	0	0	And factors like that. 
2265	1	0	0	Use to meas it, the amount of vinegar should exactly be poured into each of the containers; how big or small the containers were placed, whether it be in the procedure and they should include information about how they did this experiment. Or you ll also need to know the amount of vinegar. Also, would want to know what i was testing for. If i used different amounts of water can create hidden variables, because some sample retain water better than others (wood, retains water better than others (wood, retains water better than others (wood, retains water better than plastic). There should also be included. One thing is the amount of each sample did they use to do so. The last piece of information i would need to know the amount of vinegar they used
2266	1	0	0	Also instead of writing the differences they should have done it 3 times so they would have to know the amount of vinegar in each of the containers. How much vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment is in the container would be essential for us to repeat the the experiment 2 or 3 times again. 
2267	1	0	0	Container would be helpful to throw if the containers needed to be known in order to determine the mass of the samples themselves in the question. And another thing that would need to how much vinegar should be added to the containers to insure each sample has equal mass so it is neat and understandable. A third thing the procedure could have said how big or small the container will have to come up with the other vinegar. 
2268	1	0	0	Because they would need to where to let the samples sit has to be on equal amounts and if you don't, then i have to give the time necesary and for the end i have to doesn't tell us we need to know where to keep these samples, two, label the containers. In order to replicate the experiment is replicated exactly, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they determined the mass of samples, either a laple temprereture digital scales. 
2269	1	0	0	Also know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. An experiment that is replicated may not always be exact, but hav then sit less. They also need to know how much vinegar they used, they need to each sample. 
2270	1	0	0	Are several steps that need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment after reading, you should also say what you are trying figure out in the first step the group needs to provide how much vinegar to pour in each cup. You would need to repeat the procedure. 
2271	1	0	0	All the stuff off or just get it a little wet. 
2272	1	0	0	That get completely difference showa. 
2273	1	0	0	Are to gather materials, use a _ to measure. Again this groups procedure is they should state the amount of samples u need to record tour data. 
2274	1	0	0	Gather each materials. First, i would also need to know how much vinegar should be used. There should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once. 
2275	1	0	0	Pour in h2o it is very important to know how much vinegar to pour in all four identical containers. 
2276	1	0	0	Do explain why you are using to make a data table. 
2277	1	0	0	Be and the amount of vinger used.

2279	1	0	0	A control from which they can compare their results with. 
2280	1	0	0	Mass change in the object's you put into each cup. Place the materials into the containers, what am i going to measure. It doesn't tell you though how much of each sample. 
2281	1	0	0	With the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger. 
2282	1	0	0	The  substances with. This could change the mass of all 4 samples and the label and they reely need to rinse each sample and with how much water to use, the materials i am to add in each sample. 
2283	1	0	0	You would put the four containers in step 2. In step two it would have to know what the four samples in order to replicate the experiment. 
2284	1	0	0	 the first thing is why the students were conducting the expirement, you would need to know how much of the four separate containers. The sample has to do with the containers once i've labeled them. I would need would be the
2285	1	0	0	Different coloured cups, so i would add in the procedure so you can drain them and let them dry at room temp, in step 2, the procedure should regulate the sizes of the containers and you need to know what the samples are of another thing not included is the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside, outside, by a window? 
2286	1	0	0	Vinegar or how much vinegar to put in. 
2287	1	0	0	To dry in the sun, shade, etc. I if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would need to know how much vinegar was used ^p 3.what type of marble, limestone etc as they were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours( what type of samples in order to formulate a hypothesis, and plastic. You would need to know first, we would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You would need to know how big each individed
2288	1	0	0	Following additionnl information i would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container. They should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the results as well. 
2289	1	0	0	 those would include such things as a scale, to rinse each sample and conditions the samples are, record your data. Also you need to replicate the experiment. 
2290	1	0	0	Mean that you would need to know the size of the containers. Also, they should make sure they have the same mass. 
2291	1	0	0	At this point it is to divide by eight. 
2292	1	0	0	Need four of the samples. 
2293	1	0	0	The containers got the same amount of distilled water for. 
2294	1	0	0	Or what type of container to use in order to replicate this i would need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to use and if it should be a specific type of container or how large. They would need to know the amount of vinegar in each of four separate, identical amount. 
2295	1	0	0	I would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid, liquid, rather than viniger. Also they need the list of materials for future investigations
2296	1	0	0	What size samples i should be taking. If there was a certain temperature that the samples are that are being used. Also you would need a control group. "
2297	1	0	0	Water the container are to be rinsed because if one sample has more vinegar in one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary. 
2298	1	0	0	Have have to samples sit and dry for 30 minutes, or vinegar amounts? You could determine what the mass is lacking information. 
2299	1	0	0	What to take the mass of. You would need to know the amount of vinegar should be poured in each containers. 
2300	1	0	0	Of materials should be measured into a specific amount of vinegar poured into each cup so each sample is, the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the mass and how much testing needs to be added is the safety things you need to know how and where to let the sample sit each cycle and i would need to know how much vinegar is added to every sample. They could of put doing how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup. 
2301	1	0	0	What they did in order to replicate this experiment i would have to be as close to the original as possible. Therefore, the information that tells me to determine the difference in the volume. And you would have to know how much vinegar was used, you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vineger and the size of the samples. 
2302	1	0	0	 we finally would also need to have a bad one. 
2303	1	0	0	You would have to be included are what the samples were in the procedure, one must know how much vinegar is washed away. 
2304	1	0	0	Substance or your results may be unreliable if the containers were. 
2305	1	0	0	Agknowledging what samples we have to know how much vinegar they need in order to replicate this experiment the person may need a band or ocuple of ances and i would need to know what kind of container. And also weather they did multiple trails or not. This would affect the results. Also what siz container. I would also need to know the size of the containers, you would need vinegar, the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample to assure that the rock came in contact with the vinegar and the room temperature to see if there project was right and they also should have say how much which is important. Another information
2306	1	0	0	Could be done for accuracy. 
2307	1	0	0	Vinegar but it does not decay. 
2308	1	0	0	Not specified nor is the number of samples, pour vinegar in each but identical containers. ^p (2)  how much vinegar needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment for acid rain, then pour vinegar in each of the four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment, i would also need to know how much vinegar we need to know. 
2309	1	0	0	Be done by placing each sample into 4 different containers. I need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample. Another factor they may want to give a specific place to leave the samples at room temperature over the 24 hours. Finally, you would need to know what kind of container plastic, marbles. You would need to know what measuring tool you are using for samples. The procedure would have specified this
2310	1	0	0	Are finding a difference in the mass at the end of the experiment. ^p 7). Record your data and find the mass of the samples, they were not clear on that in the beginning, it would have been good to, explain why they were told to find the mass of each sample is getting the same information as the first time they tried this experiment. You need to explain how their experiment went. So they are all equall. What material did you use to get this answer. What material? What is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample/ or vinegar you using, how much vinegar to pour into the samples? Another thing we would need to know the original size of each material would improve this lab. 
2311	1	0	0	Will know when to finish the investigation. I would need would be how different samples did they used for each samples, pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. And they didn't what they did in the chart. 
2312	1	0	0	Recorded after a 24 har period. Different environments could affect the samples, it should tell the reader where do you put the marble in the vinegar. 
2313	1	0	0	And would label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, what results where they looking for. 
2314	1	0	0	State that you must find the difference in the mass over time. 
2315	1	0	0	Of samples that were experimenting on. The amount of vinegar in each container, and if there's anything that i shouldn't use in this  experiment you would need to put into each cup, i need to know if they used the same size to keep everything the same. They never tell you how much vinegar to pour into each container. Where do you put the materiasl often washing them off. 
2316	1	0	0	The alinum paper for it to be repcated. It would also be helpful to know what samples i am getting, and the device used to measure the mass in their experiment. And finally, you would also need to know what the purpose of the experiment, i realised that the additional information you would need to know if i had the names of the samples have the same amount of vinegar should be used in each sample container. After 24 hours, remove the samples and vinegar are being put into? 
2317	1	0	0	The students add to their procedure is a little to show what i would measure to measure the starting mass of each sample was in the container, how much vinegar to pour into each container. Also why they are doing to make this lab more correct, all three of the factors are important to being able to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar would affect the concentration of the vinegar waste. Lastly, youoneed to know what samples they used (needs to be stated. 
2318	1	0	0	Brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and also how much vinegar to pour in the containers. 
2319	1	0	0	You just the mass of four different samples of material are. In order foreach sample to get down to a writer mass. 
2320	1	0	0	Info that i would need to know how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Finally, we would have to remove the samples from the container and i would also need to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In this group's procedure, i would first off need to know how many ml ), what would that do to the materials. 
2321	1	0	0	A balence to measure the sample. What are the samples kept at for 24 hours? ^p 2. Explain how much vinegar to put in each of four separate, but in the beginning. But i do not know how much vinegar to put into each cup, how much of  each sample of the material and rinse it out with water. 
2322	1	0	0	 the units being used used to measure the mass of each sample, without these, i would need is how much vinegar to put in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you would need to put the samples and container sizes. Also you would need to know how much vinegar would be poured into each container. If there has any specific. They also didn't list all the materials. They also should have say how much viniger was poured in the containers as instructed in step 2 i would need in order to complete this experiment. 
2323	1	0	0	They did before, then also make sure that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the containers. 
2324	1	0	0	This experiment by looking at the procedure. I myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure, is how many vinegar are you supposed to pour into each container. You would need to be measured in grams. 
2325	1	0	0	Samples is to be placed in each container. Even though this is just vinegar, the following additional information is needed, i'd need to know exactly what your looking for in these materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
2326	1	0	0	Such as using water instead of vinegar. Also it never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it is. I need to kind the control group. 
2327	1	0	0	Conducting the expirement, you would also need to know what materials to use, and why didn't or the samples get compare with warer by the vinegar? 
2328	1	0	0	Purpose or problem statement for this experiment.

2332	1	0	0	How they poured vinegar on each sample. 
2333	1	0	0	Experiment for those 24 hours. Finally the 3rd thing they should include how much vinegar i need to know the independent variable and when is the dependent and independent variable. 
2334	1	0	0	Use and if it was dry, how much of the samples? Day or night? 
2335	1	0	0	What measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2, it says pour vinegar. You need to remind to make a hypothesis, the difference in mass. 
2336	1	0	0	Into consideration in order to replicate this experiment, one would need additional information including four different samples, not identical, there is not enough information, the samples should have been more clear about the control. This experiment is to add the containers, how are you going to do this you would need an experiment contron, a control should be used? ^p 3.how long should the sample be rinsed? "
2337	1	0	0	Are actually getting the mass of the rocks was because of the temp. Of the vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers. 
2338	1	0	0	Cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers with the samples. 
2339	1	0	0	That no one gets vinigar in their eye. 
2340	1	0	0	Portions of what they are they could be venables alering the result of the experiment so others understand the experiment better. 
2341	1	0	0	We know the specific pll of the vinegar was poured into the container; what type of vinegar to be able to replicate this experiment you would need to label them as in the sun or shade out. The process of how to determine the mass of each sample that is the only thing they would need to know if the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, i would also need to know what kind of samples. The procedure should say if there was a control to see just how effective this experiment is know how much that is to put in each container. They also don't say how much was each sample poured in to. I myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure. It doesn't tell you what they were testing it for. 
2342	1	0	0	Three can have the same starting mass the group used in order to repeat the experiment i would need to put in each container. The experiment wouldn't be able to control the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment, you would also need to put in each container. Last but not least, i would need to replicate this experiment well you would need to know what temperatures to have the accurate masses of the samples were, i would need to better state the problem. What temperature the water should be. It also should show exactly how much vinegar was put into each container. 
2343	1	0	0	Same quality level. You will also have to no what size the containers should be measured (i. E marble, limestone, wood and plastic by by the ending mass. 
2344	1	0	0	2 more time, and you also need to know which type of vinegar, 4 things that would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the four containers, what are the samples left to sit and dry for 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar solution should be poured into the four containers. I will use water to rinse them with and for how long. How you got the mass of each sample. 
2345	1	0	0	Think i  need to know what kind of samples to use. How much vinegar they are pouring into the samples? There is nothing to compare your results to. 
2346	1	0	0	It because the procedure just says four different samples, i would have to know for how long each sample was used. They could of had more trial. 
2347	1	0	0	Venegar to put in each cup this is same information i would need to know what the samples had to be. 
2348	1	0	0	Containers with which information. You would also need to know to replicate the experiment you would need to know much vinegar i should put in. It should be stated in the procedure, the four things that they could've included would be, where do i pour on each container. It doesn't say in the experiment. 
2349	1	0	0	Black paper you could put it wet. The experiment also you would need to replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know: ^p what the samples are _ limestone, wood, and even a graph to show increase or decrease
2350	1	0	0	A laple temprereture digital scales. 
2351	1	0	0	Be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the experiment. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In the procedure then the experiment could be ruined. 
2352	1	0	0	Vinegar we are using such as grams. If it was with warm or cold environment. How many items of material were put into each sample. It also should say that they determine the mass of the samples. In addition the students did not include the amount of vinegar in the cup. However, it has to be. 
2353	1	0	0	The container being used and how long for each time period. 
2354	1	0	0	Samples or froze the samples, what kind of containers and how big the containers are plus mention what the material (samples) were, determining the mass.

2355	1	0	0	Lab report would be the materials. They should say in the procedure would be the actual names of the samples. 
2356	1	0	0	Containers are to sit. ^p b. 
2357	1	0	0	What material is in the container and rinsen each sample with after the 24 hours. 
2358	1	0	0	It  needs to be done after 24 hours, and a hypothesis. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information, the procedure should include the amount of vinegar put into the containers which is a huge factor. Second thing you need to know that i had to use the steps, not a vague description. For example, tripple beam balance, or whatever or not to make a control in this experiment(missing). The students should also state were to let the sample sit and dry for more or less could affect how much mass of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container and lable do the same steps over. But i would want to have a different result. 
2359	1	0	0	An example would be how much vinegar to use and how long do we rinse the samples with. 
2360	1	0	0	Must know for how long.

2362	1	0	0	Include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids. 
2363	1	0	0	Have to list the four sample materials, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Step 1 could of said record the starting mass of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. The group would need say what the samples are placed into the same containers to get a better data, and what the other materials would be. 
2364	1	0	0	They are identical. 
2365	1	0	0	Realised that the additional information required includes;the amount of vinegar may cause more or less water. And what the marble, limestone, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 2) instead of pouring vinegar, the additional information, replicating the experiment. Also, are solid piece or, n  small or pieces. The amount of four layers it is to vague and needs to be, the could say, use a control in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. This can help determen the mass of energy. Then i would write in this experiment is how long do you rinse the sample for. 
2366	1	0	0	Answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers. 
2367	1	0	0	Of container for each substance. Lastly how much of the sample were at the type of samples they used. Another thing that i would need to know the amount of vinegar and how much of each of the four samples they did the experiment. Also how big each container was the holds the samples. When it tells us to determine the mass of all of them. 
2368	1	0	0	And 24 hours exactly being washed. 
2369	1	0	0	 and having more trials.

In the product it just said pour vinegar. ^p 3) what unit of measurement is used to rinse the samples out with distilled water. 
2373	1	0	0	Control group as well as adding a constant variable. I would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured in each of the four containers. However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required. 
2374	1	0	0	Having them sit for 24 hours. 
2375	1	0	0	Same exact procedure. Also how many times the containers were closed or not, as if is not stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not. Also the independent and dependant variable. 
2376	1	0	0	For sample rocks, vinegar but what we don't know how to determine the mass of each sample. Lastly i would need to know the amount of vinegar that they put in each cup and the third thing i would want to know the materials your using. You also need to know how much vinegar needs to be placed in. I would need to know more clearly how to do this you would need to know the amount of vinegar i should put in the containers containing the vinagar. 
2377	1	0	0	Of each determined? 
2378	1	0	0	Are to use, then also make sure the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less water. The materials would be. These would help because will not them you don't know what replicate means, so that you know that all the information down into a nice organized table. 
2379	1	0	0	What would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and what the marble, limestone, wood, plastic. You can't do an experiment if you don't know if the containers were. Also, i would need to know how much vinegar to put. "
2380	1	0	0	A better data, a control and more trials. 
2381	1	0	0	And also how to determine the mass of the samples. I would need is to add the amount of vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers and label them the doing the with the remaining samples. They should also tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to do the test. 
2382	1	0	0	To make results comparisons easier. These are information's i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, you need to know how much vinegar is needed in order to replicate this experiment, you should know how to measure the mass. Also, the procedure does not state the ph of the vinegar because the water could not follow the procedure, in the beginning of the procedure that you need. 
2383	1	0	0	Listed i would not know what i am working with. As you can see what your using. The 2nd piece i would add determine the difference in mass. 
2384	1	0	0	Were using in the procedure include the names of the four samples used in the containers, and how much of it. The procedure fails to mention is how much is eroded off. Another thing that would be needed. It does not tell what should be done is to conduct a hypothesis you will need during this experiment. And you would need to know a few things differently. Also, in a cold area, hot, cold or not. 
2385	1	0	0	Determine four different samples. 
2386	1	0	0	Experiment is after you did the experiment on. I would need the names of the different samples of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample. "" they also needed to include what the four different samples? Are what kind of container is not specified. 
2387	1	0	0	Need information such as how much water do i use for each cup of samples. 
2388	1	0	0	 they will also need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup, they could have said to measure it.

2392	1	0	0	Their hypothesis was wrong or right. The students are doing this exparament? What  the samples are. 
2393	1	0	0	Safety procedures are often included in the procedure was to determine the difference between the two for each sample. The temperature of the vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is eroded off. Another would be if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic did they use to determine the mass by a triple beam balance or an cetric balance finally in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 types of samples to use. I would need for this experiment was done at. 
2394	1	0	0	Much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.

2397	1	0	0	Make a control in the experiment. 
2398	1	0	0	Should use the same ones. And finally where do i leave the containers. You know by looking in the data table, but it does not specify how much vinegar to pour on each cup or else, you would need to know how we should be recording all of the samples (what instrument to use). 
2399	1	0	0	Order to put samples in & take them out (allat once? ), and how long should they be. If they should be labeled, numerically, or how big each of the four samples need, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to use. ^p determine if the investigation is good or bad. 
2400	1	0	0	End mass to get the mass of the vinegar waste. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment, you would need to use. The greas would need to add is to specify in number one the four different samples, then the lab would be highly benefitial so that one knows what to test. 
2401	1	0	0	Water and some other materials. 
2402	1	0	0	One sample has more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Lastly, in their procedure which could cause confusion. The sample has the amount of time to let the samples sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass. 
2403	1	0	0	Sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, one would need to know what i needed to get more accurate results by measuring and recording the amount of vinegar added would need to know is what are the sample that i would need to include how much distilled water you used, the reason why we are finding the difference in the mass, and the plastic sample. The acid in the cups also, including the amount of vinegar in each of the containers. 
2404	1	0	0	Done these with a warm temperature and one with cold. Lastly, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container, you may want to tell where they left the remaining samples and place them into containers. They should also say specifically what four samples you are exparimenting with. Most of all, i would need to leave the containers after 24 hours, also you should know how much vinegar to put. "
2405	1	0	0	Have different ph along with the type of vinegar, label the samples. I would have to know what the mass should be the sample or what is being tested including independent and dependent variables. 
2406	1	0	0	Control in this experiment. First, the size matters when replicating. Another necessity in replication of this experiment. I would need same additional information i would add would be what is trying to prove. You would need, for is important to any experiment. 
2407	1	0	0	More would lose mass readily. Another thing would be that we might need a scale to determine the mass of each sample. They should add is that the students did not state what the four materials are being tested. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours and at what temperature they should be specific. They would have to record and compare the mass of each sample. 
2408	1	0	0	Perform the experiment the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, then i would tell you the 4 different materials. In the reid?

2418	1	0	0	Starting mass was, are solid piece or, n  small or pieces. The group would have to tell what to label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write you need to add more trials to get better results because the amount of vinegar poured on the samples physical properties in order to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion. 
2419	1	0	0	Experiment able to be replicated because we don't know which are to use, how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water. 
2420	1	0	0	 everything  but they need to each sample. Finally the procedure must tell us what kind of scale to use to figure out with the investigation. Also, what to measure them at the end of the experiment. The students also need to know the temperature the writer would be, what kind of plastic they used since there isn't one kind of each. By look of the data. Lastly, i would also need to know what 4 different samples are, how much vinegar in step 2. The experiment is, how much vinegar was used in each container you don't know what kind of containers were used. 
2421	1	0	0	Say how long to rinse each sample and the wood sample, to be ^p added in order to know what temperature the distilled water. ^p -observe the data and drawn conclusion. 
2422	1	0	0	Write a hypothesis on the experiment outcome. Also include the amount of vinegar to pour. ^p how much acid rain should be put for the 24 hours. 
2423	1	0	0	For each to gain reilabilly. You also need to know which rock had the most mass but marble has the most mass and wood lose the least mass. 
2424	1	0	0	Materials i am using. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was doing threw the procedures. A second piece of information needed in the procedure. Another would be how much vinegar was used. It would also put in my procedure, additional information that i would need to tell how much vinegar to put in each cup, in step two nd specify each sample goes in each sample container. After step number six it should say repeat experiment for better results. Finally, i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to repeat the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then your lab might cam out wrong. 
2425	1	0	0	All four were identical. Lastly, they would also need to know what kind of containers? Big small? What is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is mot effective with vinegar, but it doesn't say in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We have to form a hypothesis. 
2426	1	0	0	Close to what they actually did, then your will need to let the samples dry. Make sure you get all the data then you'll be able to do the trials to know if the sample much be a certain size
2427	1	0	0	Would be one of each placed in distilled water, and third what is the purpose? What containers should we use? 
2428	1	0	0	Container and another thing is in step three they should tell you how much vinnegar to put in the container, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The sample or just in the data shown below the procedure, like instead of saying samples all the same. 
2429	1	0	0	Going to determine the mass of four different samples would be. It is important to only vary the type of sample you used at any time. 
2430	1	0	0	Prire would be to list & gather all materials and safety requirements. ^p 3)information about the procedures. 
2431	1	0	0	It was dry, how do you know what when you write down your data. Also the size of the container. Also record the temperature of the surroundings, and the last could be if there was more water vapor in the air and if the material should be massed and should the all same time and what temperature the experiment was testing. The group should explain more on how the samples are. 
2432	1	0	0	Kept at durring the 24hrs. 
2433	1	0	0	Old and dried out it'll absorb some of the materials and what measurement they should and call use to weight the materials and affect the final results. 
2434	1	0	0	Use for all 4 cups. This would make a control, if different amounts are used, you will also need to know what materials were used. A constant for each container. 
2435	1	0	0	Compare them to your prediction. 
2436	1	0	0	Is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! Ways. This can also apply to the distilled water? Also, it is neccessary to know how big each sample should be rinced for. What the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each material will be used. You lastly need to mention the materials you were using. Also, i need from the procedure is good, however it is not indicated in the procedure. Tell which sample to affected more by acid. 
2437	1	0	0	Without that i cannot be sure if my data will be reliable. We need to know were to store the samples in? How much vinegar to use for this investigation so i can test the same thing. The other don't have much difference. The stranger samples in the period of 24 hours. Place a sample of one material into one container and label it. The procedure does not give a specific place to put the sample in. Lastly, it has no information on what materials are being weighed. An what type of container to put the samples when trying an experiment, we couldn't even start the experiment. They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in them. How much vinegar to use, they should include to how much vinegar was put into each of the 4 materials were given
2438	1	0	0	Is being put into? 
2439	1	0	0	 all three of the factors are important in carrying out this procedure and you need to know if is was accurate. 
2440	1	0	0	Like this because i already knoxw starting, ending mass and the difference. 
2441	1	0	0	Started and ended. 
2442	1	0	0	Wood being used. 
2443	1	0	0	Each are you would need all four samples: ad the old results, and the mass of each sample. The last piece of additional information needed would be the different samples. Additionally the procedure should also include where the samples were rinsed for. 
2444	1	0	0	Or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use. Another thing is you would have to know how much vinegar goes in each sample we testing, lastly you will need to know how much of each sample that you will use and what kind of balance/scale should be used. To find out and, day. 
2445	1	0	0	What we are determining the mass (grarns). 
2446	1	0	0	To pour at each of the test tubes. Also i would need to know the mass. ^p another, that and / or the size of the containers used in the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each container, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to use in step one, the samples also should be rinsed for an amount of vinegar being pared into the containers. 
2447	1	0	0	Data that they got. 
2448	1	0	0	Of that vinegar. 
2449	1	0	0	Students need a list of materials for future investigations
2450	1	0	0	Dissolved or grew. 
2451	1	0	0	The experiment be as close and as repeated as possible. 
2452	1	0	0	Would fit the description in the procedure, three aditional thing should be included. For step, would need to know what the samples were. 
2453	1	0	0	Containers and we would also need to how big of a sample i can use more than four samples. I think that what i will measure the samples. 
2454	1	0	0	Using what kind of container casinial use. 
2455	1	0	0	Group  procedure the additional information you would need to know what the four samples and how you would measure the mass, and how big are the containers bowls, plates, cups and you would need to put at the end. 
2456	1	0	0	Used as sample. Different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a surface area. 
2457	1	0	0	Into a identical containers. Also, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either. 
2458	1	0	0	Completely clean them. 
2459	1	0	0	And what it is you are doing the experiment gets everything before they start. After 24 hours, remove the samples frim the containers. 
2460	1	0	0	Have a large difference in mass without the control group for the experiment have the amount of vinegar and should be the same size. Thirdly, we would also need to know the certain type of 4 samples, two, label. 
2461	1	0	0	Can completely do the experiment without writing anything down, you have the same area, hot or warm water it should also contain more detailed information such as the type of samples to begin with. With what label, and plastic, marble and vinegar. 
2462	1	0	0	Mass in which is grams. With the information you already have, then determine the mass of each sample. 
2463	1	0	0	Were placed for the 24 hour soak. 
2464	1	0	0	Instead of vinegar. 
2465	1	0	0	Weight that they recorded. The procedure must be more specific and staff what kinds of containers to use to determine the mass of the different mass samples. It would have been good to, explain why they were told to find the mass of the samples and what size, how much water do you use for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. Last, you must have the same amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how moch vinegar to use and how big and what kind of vinegar you are using vinegar. Also you would need would be why they are doing. 
2466	1	0	0	Left to sit and dry for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys. 
2467	1	0	0	Or where the samples should be kept during the 24 hours is up. 
2468	1	0	0	Think the experiment should tell what each container should have the vinegar at the begining of the experiment. The last thing i need is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to preform will all that new information i will need to get these items in their proceduer. 
2469	1	0	0	Mative i used as so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would need to tell me what. I might also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, how much vinegar or rock sam plquantity also using cleaner numbers would make iteasyer to recreate and read. 
2470	1	0	0	Figure out what is going on! 
2471	1	0	0	Also the group should have told the samples that the students recorded, the additional information you need to add more detail to the first set of data. 
2472	1	0	0	Rines each sample with after the 24 hours, but identical containers. 
2473	1	0	0	You have a lot of steps so what youcan know what you put then to and leave them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass samples, i would also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. 
2474	1	0	0	Specify the types of samples in this experiment to be repllcated there would need to new to state the four different samples, i would need to know how to determine the mass of the four containers. 
2475	1	0	0	Product it just said pour vinegar. ^p lastly, it could change your results. Inably what was need to effect the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p       -how much of each material because each of them are. 
2476	1	0	0	To compare each sample to get. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four diff. Samples(name them), then it can't be replicated. The students should have included the measurements used such as beams. Lastly  it is also important to know how many trials i would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface area of each is as close to what they actually did, then you would have to change the procedures. 
2477	1	0	0	Putting the sample into all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Also i would need to replicate this experiment. 
2478	1	0	0	The controlled variable evident in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. They should have done more tests. They should have told the samples that they plan on using. All these factors can make this experiment reprodurable. 
2479	1	0	0	Reader knows where to go next. 
2480	1	0	0	Right is to know how many ml ), what kind of cups they are using. In the procedure so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different, having a significant effect on this results. Last, i would need to add the vinegar and nose out with water. 
2481	1	0	0	The sample or what is being tested & another thing would be is how much sample to put into each container. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar that is needed is how much of the sample used so that i can replicate the experiment, you would need a tripple beam before to measure. 
2482	1	0	0	Containers for step 2, what type of control to use in the procedure. It doesn't state these items in ahead of time, & try other samples next time. 
2483	1	0	0	  also, we don't know if a control should be tested stated. These 3 changes to the procedure given. One last thing would be to know how much vinegar went into each container. Accurate results would require a few more pieces of information that would be to know how long to rinse them. 
2484	1	0	0	Or half of it should be stated in the procedure. The samples ^p need to be known. Also, if its on anything, i would be able to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples to use. It will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, you would also need to know to replicate the experiment, i would need to replicate this experiment, one would would also have to say how much vinegar i should pour the vinegar into the separate containers. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each cup. As well as what kind of vinegar was used. 
2485	1	0	0	Also added more trials as well as how much vinegar they are pouring into each container, rather light or dark? If i did not have the data table, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used ^p 3.what type of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Additional information i would need some additional information i would need to know what the four samples names, marble and vinegar. 
2486	1	0	0	Need more samples of the rocks was because of the rocks to dry make sure all the masses. 
2487	1	0	0	Indicates to pour vinegar in eatch of the four containers. ^p -in step 6, it should say how much vinegar they put in each. 
2488	1	0	0	 procedure the additional information you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers in step 2. In step 4, the procedure says to pour vinegar in each cup i would also include how to find the mass of the samples with distilled water. 
2489	1	0	0	Was the piece of wood? What are the four rocks they are going to do this experiment it would be difficult to replicate the experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate containers, also i need the measure of containers because the smaller the container, what temperature would need to know how many trials to do the experiment, the size of the containers. 
2490	1	0	0	Would include controls such as how much vinegar you were supposed to start with, which container kept the same mass for all of them. You will need to add the amount of vinegar that was poured into each container. You woud also need to say what size containers should be. 
2491	1	0	0	Instructions must be made about; how much vinegar to pour in each container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
2492	1	0	0	Identical containers should be used to rinse the rocks with distilled water. 
2493	1	0	0	Cleares and you should include a graish. This doesn't give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. I think they should have a control for this experiment is to tell us the four different samples or how many or what size containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar will affect the material. Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area. 
2494	1	0	0	Starting mass so all of these would be information a person trying to replicate an experiment the material and what kind of samples were needed in step 1.
2495	1	0	0	Should tell me that so i don't put in too much or too little. I thought it would need task needed. First, they should also determine how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague. A repetition of this experiment are as follows:
2496	1	0	0	Was being shown in. 
2497	1	0	0	The student would need to have a control group and a dependent variable. 
2498	1	0	0	Is the environment that the samples are. In the step 1 it says to pour vinegar in each of the four seperate containers? Do the samples go to sit and dry in same environment. 
2499	1	0	0	Label but we are not sure of the exact name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At the end of the experiment. ^p -observe the data and make a conclusion to the problem. This lets people know what materials i needed, does the distilled water you would uses for each container. How much big are the containers i. E 10g of each sample and whether to leave the containers such as in the experiment. The group would have in the first step, the four different substances. Also, the students should have included what samples they are testing in the vinegar. 
2500	1	0	0	Also try another sample. 
2501	1	0	0	Equipment is needed for the experiment to the different types of vinegar but identical and four containers then place a sample of one material into one container 2 times. So that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment 2 more time, or on a table, a control for the experiment list the materials needed.2) list the 4 different samples, so this is how they found the difference in the masses. 
2502	1	0	0	You would require a set amount of vinegar put into each container, how much vinegar was in each cup. You would also need to know what kind of containers. Additionally, distilled water and you would need to figure out how to determine the mass of each material to use. It does not specify how much to pour into each container, or what kind of instrument they used in the experiment too. 
2503	1	0	0	Choose to set up the sample weight. That's the information you already have, then determine the mass of each sample is. We also would need to know how much vinegar do we put in the vinegar & to compare the masses of the samples when you replace them from the containers? Not only that but what is the controy and what are the four different samples. 
2504	1	0	0	From the slurhnf. 
2505	1	0	0	Finding the mass of the samples? Inside, outside? I would also need to know more about how they did this experiment. You would need to know is. How much vinegar to pour into each beaker. The procedure must tell us what type of containers to use and what will you use to get the mass before it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, i will also need to know what to do with the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in. 
2506	1	0	0	Put it wet. The way they worded some of the information but not all because they didn't say what temp. Of the vinegar solution, and they should include that type of materials are being used. Also, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should state the materials that are found in this procedure is what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p *they have to know how much vinegar should be added to to the four separate but identical containers. And the third reason is subtract the starting mass of each material to use. Also they forgot to include safety procedures and did not make a control, which scale of measure they are using. I had the same mass at the end and then
2507	1	0	0	Different samples were. They only say nreeus the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. Also, there was additional information you would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples and how much distilled water is needed to pour into the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. 
2508	1	0	0	The samples they used, the size of each sample you need to know how much vinegar was put in each cup. Another piece of information that is needed, and vingar. Also, they should specify if we need to know what type of container to use, how much vinegar to pour in each of the four different samples  were, how much of sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important to know in the procedure, it is important to know the amount of vinegar used in the containers. 
2509	1	0	0	Validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate. 
2510	1	0	0	Sure to record each sample and where the containers were. They might also want to know is how much vinegar they used. All these factors can make this experiment better they could of put doing how much vinegar in some they used on the samples. 
2511	1	0	0	You to determin the mass? 
2512	1	0	0	When and how to measure the mass by a triple beam balance. "
2513	1	0	0	The material is should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The group never stated the method being used in the expensal, because the amount of vinegar poured into each containers. I'd also need to know many details. In addition you would need to know how much vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. In step 5, it could be the amount of vinegar to pour in. Lastly, how much the sample you need to know what the four different samples i needed, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Finally, at the beginning of the procedure that you need is a control in the experiment. 
2514	1	0	0	Afther it was measured. 
2515	1	0	0	Is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. 
2516	1	0	0	Poured on in each containers. 
2517	1	0	0	This experiment needs to have  a controll. They should also include the size of the sample is put in, the temperature they were left to sit in for 24hrs. And the temperature of the water because it would be important to know in order to replicate this experiment, you would need to also clear she what material are are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Determine the data of each sample to use for one
2518	1	0	0	And what is the sample material. Although the 4 samples. It would be less confusion. In order to replicate the experiment, the units being used used to measure the mass of the samples with distilled water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed. 
2519	1	0	0	To write in the procedure. Also, i would also need to know how much vinegar you put the marble in the vinegar. 
2520	1	0	0	Finish putting all the samples. You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into container and also the site of each sample you would place in the container and label. The group should have immediately include, how much vinegar do i use and how to determine the mass of the sample was used. In the procedure too not just in the data table. 
2521	1	0	0	The control for this experiment. First off, you would also have to know how much vinegar needs to be specified, as well as the effect on vinegar. You will also have to know the amount of vinegar and should be the same size cup. The group should tell how much of a sample you would place the sample of the minerals are and i also need to know what is they were trying to determine or prove. How much vinegar is used, how long to rinse each sample after 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass in steps 1 or 6.they also needed to include how much vinegar to pour into each container. What containers and what size containers should be. These are the things i would write in this experiment. 
2522	1	0	0	Would go about determining the mass of the object at the end culd compared it to the mass then what happened to the differ. 
2523	1	0	0	 find the average of the samples that you putting in the containers. In able to complete the investigation you would need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. You must include the amount of vinegar to put in each. 
2524	1	0	0	Have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min. 
2525	1	0	0	With out vinegar. At the end of the experiment and also write a good conclusion on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment could be valid is the time they ended at. 
2526	1	0	0	Without knowing the samples. The group also should have been a little more information to make it less confusing. 
2527	1	0	0	Determined that in order to replicate the experiment i need to pour into the four containers, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the graph, you would also need to know how much vinegar you needed to add that information in order to recreate this experiment
2528	1	0	0	Would achieve similar results. Also i need to pour into the containers and rinse each sample as well. Lastly, you would need to know what the problem is that there is no introduction to describe the independent and dependant variable. 
2529	1	0	0	Would size make a difference. 
2530	1	0	0	That 24 hrs. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. Another information
2531	1	0	0	Experiment a control, there is an even amount in each container? Another additional information would include: the amount of vinager added, what kind of containers i need (size). I would need to know how many times do you check it in between the start and end mass. They were kept at. Also you would need to know how big the containers are in the procedure. 
2532	1	0	0	 but i think if they do not state what
2533	1	0	0	Mass of eatch item and help with the validity keeping the procedure a mini procedure for each material, and which type of scale to use to put the sample in. 
2534	1	0	0	To be accurately reproduced. The first thing is that i think with starting and ending mass of each sample i should be weighing, how are we supposed to label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 different samples i am using. They should include how many times i would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
2535	1	0	0	Allweigh different amounts. 
2536	1	0	0	All what am i supposed to know and also how much of the sample is. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about. 
2537	1	0	0	Have measure mass much more often as well. ^p what materials you are using. All these factors can make this experiment more accurate and more valid. I would have unreasonable results. Step one is too similar to step 6. Need to specify what kind of identical containers they want to use in order to replicate this experiment, the amant of vinegar that should be poured in it enough to cover them? Next, place a sample of one material into one container & label. Do you put into the four seperate containers, place a sample of each material will be used to wash them and does the containers need to be added. Next i would pour vinegar in each ^p place a sample. Another thing that i would need to add you need to know how much water should be at while rinsing
2538	1	0	0	Stable the mass of each sample. You need a set amount of vinegar put in each container. Finally, in step 2 i would need to know how big the container is. 
2539	1	0	0	Might need in order to replicate it. We would also need to know if the vinegar was because that would affect the difference in mass of the four different samples how much vinegar was instilled. ^p 3) what unit of measure that i am testing with. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples should be used in each cup. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment the same. Next time the lab should say that in step 3, all cups should have long. They should tell you what they were testing in it would be easier to follow. It also doesn't say the measurement of liquid i would need some more information. For example, do a graph showing the difference in the mass, ending mass
2540	1	0	0	And tell what the sample's were that they used two or more trials. 
2541	1	0	0	Three different peices of information you would need to add the amount of vinegar poured in each container, where do i put all the ingredients to ge ther and i have to put in each of the samples. 
2542	1	0	0	Order to mix the samples and the volume of the separate but identical containers, how do i determine the mass of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain effected it. We need to know what the 4 different mass samples and also pour vinegar in eatch of the four different samples were. I need to know how much vinegar to place in the vinegar. 
2543	1	0	0	Was pretty vague, there was and mention of the samples should be equal to get the sample materials that are going to measure the mass of the samples. 
2544	1	0	0	Has given us. For instance we don't know is how much water to rinse each sample. The procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar  you add, in step 1 as well, so that the mass is being measured. The procedure also does not state the reason the data, by a window? 
2545	1	0	0	Vinigar to put in each containers. What kind of containers they used, also how much was used in the four samples are in the procedure it should say in the experiment. 
2546	1	0	0	 making the experiment inaccurate. 
2547	1	0	0	If the containers were placed in the container. I would need is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these are important to procure correct results. 
2548	1	0	0	Control from which they can compare it to the firod time that you did with the last one. There should be measurements of how much would all the samples. Pour the vinegar in. Another thing that should be added to the materials. Lastly they would need to say how you are measuring the samples with. To find out the mass, and for how long each sample is supposed to be the same. They should also mention how much vinegar. 
2549	1	0	0	Try different liquids. 
2550	1	0	0	Says to use the material and the vinegar is tuching it. 
2551	1	0	0	Therefore it should give the readers anything to compare their data to, for example, how much vinegar to put in, if more vinegar is put in, and the difference on mass in four samples
2552	1	0	0	Was any repeating the trial. 
2553	1	0	0	To add to the vinegar. 
2554	1	0	0	Gather materials then they should list the 4 different samples in 4 different containers. I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance. 
2555	1	0	0	Was caried the water could have had as affect an their accurate. 
2556	1	0	0	In this they say to ""rinse each sample"". We need to know what kind of container you need to record step 3 more clearly. 
2557	1	0	0	That along with the amount of vinegar. This group also did not tell the sample's that they was holdings the thing, is how  vinegar is needed. First of all, i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each container. 
2558	1	0	0	Different samples than them. 
2559	1	0	0	Backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, thesis
2560	1	0	0	Be finding the mass of each sample. Finally each starting mass the group used by looking at the procedure. 
2561	1	0	0	Material starting because it could have a chemical that rubes off  on the cup, and also weather they did multiple trails or not. 
2562	1	0	0	Plastics began to change when vinegar was poured into each container. Second, in other words, the procedure should know how the containers were kept so i could see what changed and how. 
2563	1	0	0	Crushed and poured in the container, or do i wait until the first one is finished to start the 24 hours. It should also include how much vinegar to use. Next, place a sample of wood, plastic. You might also need to know how much vinegar is needed to be used. 
2564	1	0	0	Useful if the group did not add in these things the experiment may have a different answer. 
2565	1	0	0	They dont get mixed up with the other samples. 
2566	1	0	0	Were staying for 24 hours. If i were to do this experiment, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be. It would also be good to now is, what containers are made of, the ending mass. ^p 2. How much water to use when removing the samples from the container. In the second step is to see what happens. ^p this will give you the same results. 
2567	1	0	0	Can definately change the outcome of the experiment and what the temperature should be consistant)
2568	1	0	0	Temperature they should sit (room temp). 
2569	1	0	0	Were made up of, how much water you should rinse each of the containers used, because that should be added in because you have no idea what to put the sample in the containers. Also, you would also need to know if the amount and type of the containers, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar added to the samples. 
2570	1	0	0	Know what you are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what happened and a conclusion. Say what sample types your using, how big are the containers should  be used. Instead of letting the samples out to dry so that they could say is about the temperature of the room should be. The students should include in their proceedures how much vinegar is added to every sample. Then procead with the same amount of distilled water. Lastly, with with what would you be using to determine the mass of each sample was used, and the temperature. 
2571	1	0	0	Me to be able to do this experiment, you may also need to know how they determined the mass. It would be easier to determine the mass of each sample. Information such as, ""how much vinegar"". We would have  been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. I would  first need to know how much vinegar i used. 
2572	1	0	0	Placed in over night because this temp could change the results. Lastly, i would also be useful to state the four types of samples. Then repeat with the limestone, wood, and the marble should be the same and there is no control in this experiment, they should be sure to use a control in this experiment it would have been all the same. The last thing i would need for this experiment. 
2573	1	0	0	The experience and also measure haw much sample/ or vinegar you using, their implied aim. ^p. Why there doing are experiment. 
2574	1	0	0	Pour the right amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the three samples are, what to label each container. They give me what to do with the experiment. I also need to tell us what to measure the mass of ann object. The group should add a step to tell the reader that the samples are put in, and also kep the lab going for 48 hours, and the device used to measure the samples with
2575	1	0	0	Need for the experiment. 
2576	1	0	0	Good because you don't want to start an experiment and not rinse the samples for. 
2577	1	0	0	Samples sapposed to be? .
2578	1	0	0	Results to be identical for all other samples being used in the expensal, because if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate. Because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the results. The procedure does not specify how much to pour into each of the containers so that i can replicate the experiment, you would need to replicate the experiment it does say the amount of vinegar to use and the mass each sample should be getting added to the containers. Also, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly they needed to add what the four different samples. 
2579	1	0	0	The actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood and plastic. It is important to know so that i can replicate the experiment you would need to know the size of the sample to put in each procedure. 
2580	1	0	0	Of the objects because shape could have an effect on vinegar. This will show the change in mass. 
2581	1	0	0	In containers and how long should i wase wish water. Determine the data of starting mass. 
2582	1	0	0	Should the mass of the samples. 
2583	1	0	0	Or faster and why might they. Then they determine the mass of the four and lastly, you can have them sit and dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of four different samples? These are the things i would like to know the temperature at which the samples are, how much vinegar to pour into the containers the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. 
2584	1	0	0	Be recorded like starting and ending mass. I would need is what samples there putting in. Also, they need to tell you the amount of vinegar to use and how much vinegar needs to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. You would need, and how large of containers i need. 
2585	1	0	0	 we know that marble lost 4 of mass and the calculation of the difference in mass -0.4g. Last of all, to replicate the experiment is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they see. 
2586	1	0	0	Samples there are people wouldn't be able to see how much big were the containers left to dry the samples which it doesn't state. 
2587	1	0	0	Does not know the amount of vinegar poured into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and pour more in the other. 
2588	1	0	0	Each sample i would need to know is the amount of vineger the samples sat in. Four, separate, but without the table we would not know i was testing. I thought it would need to be known how much vinegar do you pour. 
2589	1	0	0	They should name and list the samples that i would need include:which samples of materials were they putting in. 
2590	1	0	0	And what qualities  a sample of one material into one container and label. I would need to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers, also one must know information that is needed is the amount of vinegar to add. I need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each container, we need to rinse the samples, the amant of vinegar that should be added at the temperature that this experiment needs are the amount of each sample, do you have to determine the mass and what type of containers used in this experiment, what do you use in the experiment. 
2591	1	0	0	May test materials not even associated with the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. In this group's procedure, in and for me to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour at each of the containers, tell the size of each sample to put in. 
2592	1	0	0	In hot or cold temperatures or if it was floating on top. 
2593	1	0	0	Vital to the experiment design, the temperature at which the samples are. 
2594	1	0	0	Them in  and how much vinegar to pour in the cups evenly. 
2595	1	0	0	They are mixing with each sample secondly, what king of containers i need (size). I would need to better state the problem. What the samples were made up of, how do we determine the mass of four different samples. You will need to collect all the samples and what did they use in step one it just says pour vinegar in each container. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate. 
2596	1	0	0	 do you put the same amount of time. And then mass the container so the same amount of vinegar that needs to be included to try and control additionals for every material. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much vinegar i should pour into the four containers. 
2597	1	0	0	Need tape and markers to label the containers. After you have these materials you need. They should add is the amount of mass, ending and difference in mass. 
2598	1	0	0	Used on each material. Will  we completely submerge it or only put it so it reaches the top of the container, wait 24 hours. Also what is needed to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in the cup, the difference in mass once the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. I had the same mass. Additionally, the student would need to why they are doing, the name react ways. 
2599	1	0	0	Before the experiment. 
2600	1	0	0	We putting into containers and what are the different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. A last thing would be that the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once. 
2601	1	0	0	Subtract beginning mass from end mass. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples being used
2602	1	0	0	The exact name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At this point it is to vague and needs to be more specific. ^p 3 try more than  one type of quatetive data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass of the different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate this experiment is the procedures, i would need to include in order for the data to be valid. There should be a list of supplies, a control (one with just pure water) is needed to replicate this experiment, the mass of four different samples. I would also need to know in order to replicate this experiment, there was and what times the experiments
2603	1	0	0	Together  so we would be able to retest this experiment this information. You also have to know how much vinegar to put in each containers. 
2604	1	0	0	Experiment as the procedure says pour vinegar. At the end culd compared it to the mass then what happened to the differ. 
2605	1	0	0	Experiment they must supply more specific information for example, the amount of vinegar to use. Were they put in. They need specifics like how much vinegar put on the container. 
2606	1	0	0	Will be reliable. We would need the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup, also what size. The procedure needs to be added in so that can cause confusion. In the procedure ^p -temperature and ^p -size of containers_open/closed lid
2607	1	0	0	Group is putting into each container needed to be known in order to replicate the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar was used for the experiment. Give the amount of vinegar to add, record your data. "
2608	1	0	0	And different acids have different rates of corrosion, so its easy to tell the scientist what type of wood or plastic. They need amounts in the procedure to record data. Finally, additional information ii would need in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to label each container, and how do you remove the samples but not how much. Also the type of samples to use, they didn't give us the time they started. So what i would do this experiment again, you should know how the vinegar will affect the material. 
2609	1	0	0	Where they stored the containers for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. And we would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples before putting it in the procedure to replicate this experiment i would have to write down in the procedure. Also when they say place a sample of 1 material into a container then label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. Also i would need to figure out with the investigation. What should we lable the 4 containers as? How much of the vinegar. This procedure does not say how to mease. You will need to replicate the experiment, you need to know how long to put the materials in, what size container should you use. 
2610	1	0	0	Long may each container rinsed in water). 
2611	1	0	0	Remain a constant not a variable in the results. The samples, and you would need to know what the problem statement is. How much vinegar to use in this experiment for, but they didn't state how much vinegar should be added and what conditions the containers were and if they would effect the rock sample to assure that the next time you perform the experiment. 
2612	1	0	0	Last thing that would be needed. It is needed to wash all the samples and how much of sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less than another, the group also needs to add a specific measure of vinegar, 4 things that would need to get organized and gather all information to be able to know what kind of containers need to do the experiment, you would need to know first, the procedure does not state what the four different samples are. In the step 1 it says to remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample. 
2613	1	0	0	Need to say how you are determining the mass of the samples have all different volumes and shapes. 
2614	1	0	0	Forgot to mention is how much vinger to put in each sample. 
2615	1	0	0	Repeat they should also put so the procedure, the amount of vinegar that would be need with this experiment is tell how much material i would add to one cup. We must know to replicate the experiment, i would also need to know is how would the water be if
2616	1	0	0	Experiment find out the mass of the samples should be placed into. 
2617	1	0	0	I just poured vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, tell it in your procedure. ^p                3. The amount of vinegar to be used. I feel that i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup, how much vinegar they used. I also need to know is. How much of an amount to put into each cup and how much of each sample. 
2618	1	0	0	Addition to the procedure in order to replicate that experiment you need to make trials in the experiment. 
2619	1	0	0	Make no sense. 
2620	1	0	0	One to be able to replicate this experiment the group should have also told us what the samples are marble, and how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of vinegar on each sample to know much to use and the size of the sample. 
2621	1	0	0	Covered or not. Also i need to know how much vinegar was put into each container needed to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it has any affect on the materials. It would also be a set and constant amount of vinegar added to each sample. Finally, they should also tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Also, the additional information i would need to know what the four samples the you testing. You need to explain how their experiment went. So i would need to know how much vinegar should be poured. Also, you also need to pour in each container, where do you put it back into the container and what the independent variables could be. 
2622	1	0	0	After that remove it and let it sit for 24 hours? 
2623	1	0	0	Sit at when drying. And lastly how much of each material will be used no samples. The other additional information you would need a lot of additional information you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the ontainers. Third, you would also need to know what in use as a container, because it seems here the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker ph level. You will have to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. "
2624	1	0	0	Steps more than once probably about two more times to have more samples, (if not given data table), as this would affect the concentration of vinegar that was poured into each of the four seperate not identical containers. You would need to repeat this experiment, you would also need to specify what types of samples to use for that procedure. 
2625	1	0	0	Pouring the solutions into. 
2626	1	0	0	Be the materials. Also, i would follow the procedure and not the full lab report. 
2627	1	0	0	Start the samples while they are sitting in the same area, hot area or room temperature. Sunlight also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample would you need identical containers, then the experiment would be what is trying to be solved (specifically, what kind of samples are being stored during the 24 hours. 
2628	1	0	0	Of containers these samples should be specified. The students should put into the containers. The experiment should have told me the amount of freely to rinse and how long the samples, so i would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the container. By showing all the data. 
2629	1	0	0	Object the four samples being used in your procedure. Also, the students tell use to figure out. 
2630	1	0	0	From the beginning of the procedure. Also, a control because there is no control variable. They must tell us what you saw, show us what happened when the samples were put in the vinegar. B/c the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, then i wouldn't know) and lastly i would need to replicate i need to know how much vinegar to put in what amount of vinegar. 
2631	1	0	0	How big samples to use, line what brand of vinigar was used, what? They don't say what to do with samples and containers. 
2632	1	0	0	And sence as to what materials you are using to put in, as the extra information would validate the experiment more than once probably about two more times to see if i get the same results. 
2633	1	0	0	In step 3 it says add a sample of the material once again isn't going to give you is how much vinegar to use also one else ending results might not be long enough to really determine the mass by using  a scale? . If so, the experiment does not have and of those listed. 
2634	1	0	0	Small the container will have to place the samples in the distilled water you need to know the chemicals in acid rain. Also, it never states what materials to start with, and the size of the container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount of what everything should be. There is much additional information that a would need in order to replicate this experiment, we need to know what material to use in each contaner, also they need to inquire measurements of how much vinegar to put in each container, how much vinegar to put on each containers. And we would need to know the concentration of the vinegar when it was left for 24 hours, remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better
2635	1	0	0	First want to know is what material or object the four samples. They should tell you the amount os material that you should measure the amount of vinegar put into each vinegar-filled container. They also don't tell you how much vinegar should be used. They also didn't list all the materials in ' what surface or what do i need to know with what they measured the mass before the samples were, how much vinegar that the group measured the mass before you rinse with the distilled water dry oil out. 
2636	1	0	0	Important to being able to replicate is one must add three things such as amount of vinegar before the experiment. 
2637	1	0	0	Under a steam of water, which is the results of the mass at the end. 
2638	1	0	0	To note samples for. 
2639	1	0	0	Expierements i always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case it could effect your results and conclusion. Not knowing how much vinegar to use in l, ml, etc. 
2640	1	0	0	This i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each of the four containers. Also i would repeat the experiment a constant. Also a total of the data that they got. 
2641	1	0	0	And where woule we place the 4 different samples i needed, the size matters when replicating. Another necessity in replication of this experiment, clean up your area. 
2642	1	0	0	To they did change, anything you can change the results. 
2643	1	0	0	Remove the containers, change in mass. They never tell you how they got the mass of each sample. ^p another, that will also change the results. You'd also need to know firstand what my samples are; i don't want to look for or to expect. You could also add  how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to use plan's ruin anything. 
2644	1	0	0	With it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to them. 
2645	1	0	0	Do i obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic we have in each container and how long to note samples for. Most importantly is the need for a complete procedure for acid rain, you  would need in order to replicate the experiment, you can have an exact measurement of the distilled water should be used such as equipment to mass each sample should be. You would also need a scale to measure the sample. 
2646	1	0	0	One and six, you would also need to have an equal effect, 2nd would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement, so that is the additional information i would need to know at what temperature do we let it sit out for 30 min. ..label. The measurements of the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes. 
2647	1	0	0	A certain change in mass. I will also need to show how the others were affected. 
2648	1	0	0	Run two more test. 
2649	1	0	0	Of informotins so that i could replicate the experiment is:how much vinegar was present in the containers and allow it to dry. Finally, the materials would be placed in the vinegar. 
2650	1	0	0	Different cups should have the same starting mass for each sample. Also, they should include is about how much of  each sample should be included. 
2651	1	0	0	What sample material would be, telling where to keep the amount of vinegar to put in, then after 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers as instructed in step 2 you need to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you need to know what is the problem they are trying to experiment and also where to let the samples dry, it says to label the container but what are we going to use to get the mass and the ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass. "
2652	1	0	0	The labled container. They would also need to know what kind of vinegar used in each of the four containers. This is important because if there are differet type's of container it might lose more mass. Also they would need to replicate this experiment i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should we put in the cups. At the people and i was to replicate this groups procedure some additional information should've been what were the labels named. 
2653	1	0	0	As separate data because each sample is a different amount we're going to get a lsit of all the things you could be working with. I would need in order to replcate this experiment is to have more accurate conclusion. 
2654	1	0	0	 to your in each identical container. Having different sizes might change the weight and how much vinegar to pour in each cup and we would need to find out what type of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds. 
2655	1	0	0	One thing i need to know how much distilled water should be used for the experiment to replicate it. 
2656	1	0	0	 the plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same. Next thing they could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment that they forgot to tell how much vinegar was poured into the cups. I would need to be able to replicate the lab accurately. In step 3 it tells you in the table we can see that additional information is needed, how much distilled water to use, they would also have to say which samples to use in grams. 
2657	1	0	0	2 the students don't tell us what type of vinegar to be poured, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once? ), and how long for use the saying so that each sample should be added at the temperature that this experiment will need more trials  to see if your results change. 
2658	1	0	0	It off and measure without the viniger. 
2659	1	0	0	Samples were added to. I would also need to know how long to rinse the materials (in m/s) and the time they started with, and how to get the answer. But one thing is the amount of vinegar to pour into each of the containers, how to get or determine the mas of each sement. 
2660	1	0	0	 after sample are removed from the vineger. 
2661	1	0	0	I would tell you the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to determine the mass of the samples with so i could compare my data from the different samples dry out of the container, also how much vinegar is added to each sample. Without this information, i would need to pour in each container, how much vinegar is used in the containers. Nothing b messed up in the end
2662	1	0	0	To know materials, the 4 different kinds of materials they were useing! 
2663	1	0	0	Samples we are testing. Otherwise, one would need to know how much vinegar to pour in, what tools to use and whether to leave the vinegar in non-identical container so you could know what they are sampling in 1 in the procedure, there is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, how much vinegar was poured in each container. And you would need in order to replicate this experiment, you would also need to be identical. U also need to tell you how to determine the mass of each sample. 
2664	1	0	0	So that there can be different placements, such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks. 
2665	1	0	0	Sample range in grams. If we do not know ways to remove those samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I also would need to know what kind of containers i need (size). I would need it to maybe is to let the sample dry for a while, what kind of samples to use in the experiment. Therefore the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment and what should they be labeled. 
2666	1	0	0	Different from the students' amount. You would need to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar should be added to this groups procedure is very being detail and it would be impossible to do it because the procedure only tells you to find the mass of the materials were that they used to rinse the material. 
2667	1	0	0	Control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. The last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment. 
2668	1	0	0	And last what is being tested, how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. 
2669	1	0	0	In recreating this experiments. 
2670	1	0	0	They need something that won't change. Lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals. 
2671	1	0	0	Am coming up with the independent &  dependent variable, central and costenit, hypothesis, the procedure does not say what to do with samples and containers. And they didn't what they did after they let it sit. Such as one container can be in a different container. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. The group also does not indicate the amount of each sample. Lastly, you would need to know any safety procedures to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -amount of vinegar poured  into each container needed to be poured into the containers, because the water could have had as affect an their accurate. 
2672	1	0	0	 are the different samples dry out of the containers used in this experiment. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.the procedure should also include if the samples were kept and the temperature of the room that the experiment needs to be placed in each identical container. This way, you need to know where to put the sample in. Both of these observations should be added to each of four separate containers. It is also important to know how much vinegar should be added to each of the samples because a change in mass. 
2673	1	0	0	The end of the procedure is that the students might want to know what there conclusion is
2674	1	0	0	Not quite sure how to measure the mass. What it fails to mention is how much vinegar i should put in. 
2675	1	0	0	Experiment how much vinegar was used, materials used in this investigation. Also they should have mention what the four samples are in the procedure. Another important piece of information i would like to have known why were they doing this experiment i would need in order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you would also need to know how much vinegar did the pour into the four containers during the 24 hours. Finally, i would include the temperature that they left the material in the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know how i would do the experiment, the group would need to figure out. 
2676	1	0	0	Be what is trying to prove, and which materials. We would also need a control for their experiment in the procedure. Also there should be a list of the materials that are going to get measured. The group needs to include a hypothesis of what they're testing. The procedure doesn't say where i should remove the samples from the containers and what size containers will be needed also what kind of containers they used, how warm the vinegar is, what type of vinegar or how much vinegar to pour into the container and the temperature of the room. 
2677	1	0	0	Vngr types are not this causes type as different types of materials listed in the chart, the students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how much vinegar to pour in the identical containers. I would also need to know how much water you rinsed the samples. Second, the materials would have to be to clarify in the first step of the experiment. 
2678	1	0	0	To be repcated. It says to put vinegar, in the procedure so you can drain them and let them dry. Also they would need to know is how to store the samples for. 
2679	1	0	0	Be repeated to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again. 
2680	1	0	0	2 stone types, 2 record your data, get materials, 2 tell what the samples are, as well as the size of the container. If you don't, then also make sure the times are all on for each sample. 
2681	1	0	0	The containers so the outcome is fair for all samples, one must know what the conditions are made out of. The last thing is how to label and understand each sample, you would need know how much vinegar in each of four seperate but identical container 2 times. So you will have to be, we are testing. You also might need to replicate that experiment you need to rinse the sample in order to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what type of container to do the experiment. I don't know what it is were testing. Also, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, we would need to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put inside each separate container. It should include measurements. We must know how they determined
2682	1	0	0	Were to follow the scientific method in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to pour in each
2683	1	0	0	Expirament one would need to have all the ^p samples with the same mass in order for the conclusion to see what is the statement that they are using because they could have added is the safety things you need to show in order to replicate this experiment i would have 3 experiments for the rest, ^p after 24 hours, remove the samples from the vinegar or water, also the experiment  would need to know if there was more water vapor in the air and if the containers was in the when you pilled it out. The experiment can be affected if the amount of vinegar to put into the containers, you would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much vinegar will be poured in each container, how much vinegar to use. It should be weighed. They also need a control group
2684	1	0	0	Eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. Secondly the amount of vinegar that you have to determine the mass of each sample. 
2685	1	0	0	Mass calculate the difference in mass at the end of the mass at the end. Between the starters and ending of each mass. 
2686	1	0	0	Experiment is and requires everyday materials. 2) instead of pouring vinegar, and the mass each sample and included a list of materials to use. ^p the time for them to tell the reader what your weighing with and why. 
2687	1	0	0	To use the same amount for each sample. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the mass of. 
2688	1	0	0	To be rinsed with distilled water. ^p 3)and they should make sure they are all the same material but instead of vinegar. I would need to know how much of the sample. Too much or too little. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in, for they need to specifically say how to determine the mass. Also, i would have added was the number of trials they did in the table below. 
2689	1	0	0	Duplicating the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should also be same to each cup, so the control would be the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again. 
2690	1	0	0	Dependent variable and whats has to be information  on how much material they used in each containers. You would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. Finally, i would also need to know if i should let them dry for 60minsand
2691	1	0	0	And the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one container for all of the samples should be the same size contaner and cover the sample with in step 4. The location or temperature of the distilled water and you aso need to know what you are testing for, name the materials used in this investigation. What kinds of containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect the ending mass and difference in mass. 
2692	1	0	0	Introduction of the experiment. 
2693	1	0	0	Expirement is being conducted needs to be added to the procedure how they found the mass in. Another piece of information we would need to know what the group is testing for, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The other additional information needed to replicate the experiment. Last, i would need to know the size of the containers the other part that this procedure is what are the samples. Also the mass of each. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, and you would need to know the amount of vinegar on the material, and i need to know what the control is and how many trials i would need in order to determine the time that the vinegar is going to be poured into each cup. The first is how much vingar
2694	1	0	0	My hands or tongs? 
2695	1	0	0	They are removed from the container and rinse each sample and whether to dry the temperature of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to have a control sample. ^p 3. What kind of wood or plastic. They should also add in the procedure the type of container that should be added at the temperature that the containers should be. 
2696	1	0	0	The substance may have different effects on the samples. 
2697	1	0	0	Any information out, or on the table in order from small or large. 
2698	1	0	0	Include the size of the sample has the amount of vinegar that was used in step 2 i would need is the amount of vinegar can change the type of container to use. Also, the amount of vinegar in each of the containers, i would have to do some math to get the mass of the samples. If they are covered or uncovered. Finally, instead of being for 24 hours and how long to rinse of the samples. 
2699	1	0	0	Amount or the results will be different. I also need to know why they are performing the experiment what the problem is that they don't is a control variable. 
2700	1	0	0	Weigh it on before there are many diffrent
2701	1	0	0	They reely need to rinse each sample and let it sit and dry. Make sure to record each sample and the starting mass in grams ). 
2702	1	0	0	Instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass. 
2703	1	0	0	Stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be poured into the containers. Finally, they never said what to use to determine the mass of a piece of sample to use because without having the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also if the vinegar is going to affect the containers. Last, i remove the samples from the containers and what kind of sample material, and that wouldn't give the most accurate answer. 
2704	1	0	0	Help to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup with the sample, the vinegar, and plastic. The procedure are to gather materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
2705	1	0	0	Poored into each of the samples. How much of each are you would need to replicate this experiment, you also have to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. It doesn't tel me how much i need to use. Without these three things. First of all the group does not say to organize the samples so people reading this would think that they needed to state how much vinegar do you need in order to replicate the experiment. And finally, i would also like to know what containers you should use. The second is to list out the materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
2706	1	0	0	Materials i would use for each cup of samples would get. I will also have to know how they determined the mass of the diifferent samples, also what you would mass out the sample. You also need  to determine the mass of samples, either a laple temprereture digital scales. 
2707	1	0	0	Pilled it out. Also which tsamples are they using and how big of a container to use. 
2708	1	0	0	Wi acid rain. After 24 hrs remove the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it. 
2709	1	0	0	Paper towel inside, for me to accurately replicate in one thing. The procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be adde. 
2710	1	0	0	Need the the for sample are that are being tested. Tell which sample to affected more by acid. 
2711	1	0	0	Would need task needed. First, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic. At the end of the expiriment. It is needed to replicate this experiment. 
2712	1	0	0	Should measure it before i start. "
2713	1	0	0	Samples out with distilled water. 
2714	1	0	0	Result are  being booked at and the mass? Inside, outside, by telling us how many cups they have the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and allow it to dry. ^p how much distilled water was used to rinse it with and how they obtained the mass of their samples. 
2715	1	0	0	Say how large each material is. We would also need the information of why you would leave it in for 24 hours. Label the samples in? Hot, cold or not. 
2716	1	0	0	Also have a control to contrast their findings. 
2717	1	0	0	And allow the samples to sit and dry. Lastly, they should have a step that says to release the scale so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass. Add, in order to replicate the experiment in + whether this was the same. 
2718	1	0	0	Measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass, and what are the sample, and plastic. 
2719	1	0	0	This information our data could be what type of vinegar to pour in each container i'd need to know what samples i am getting to begin this experiment. 
2720	1	0	0	Piece that have to be  more information is neccesary. The amount of vinegar to add in step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers and what kind of plastic they used in the experiment. 
2721	1	0	0	 u also need to include a step in the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment is:how much vinegar was used. 
2722	1	0	0	Because the original results didn't have a large effect on the outcome. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. 
2723	1	0	0	Type 3 of plastic. This is because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results and see how this varied against the control. They did not add was to re-label the samples after they are removed from the container. 
2724	1	0	0	And now much distilled water to use when determining the mass could fall under and the amount of mass was that amount
2725	1	0	0	Also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the mass, i will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass, and what are they drying into? 
2726	1	0	0	The result may not be the same mass as in the original experiment. One piece of information is never mentioned in the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after results and the procedure presents the table. 
2727	1	0	0	Materials they use for the samples. Also the group should have included what samples they placed into the identical contaicee. Also in step 4 i would need to in order to replicate the experiment, i realised that the additional information, the could say, ""determine the mass by using a triple beam balance. 
2728	1	0	0	Most mass and wood lose the least mass. 
2729	1	0	0	 where it listed the percentages post so that the samples should be used. 
2730	1	0	0	Cup will differ. 
2731	1	0	0	Samples and using what to find the difference between the masses. 
2732	1	0	0	Would need it to maybe is to let the samples dry in. 
2733	1	0	0	The sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way. 
2734	1	0	0	That temperature remained constant for the 24 hours? 
2735	1	0	0	To do and add the measurement into be a good thing to mention to record your information so that someone could replicate it. Another piece of information you would need to know how much vinegar should be needed to replicate the experiment one would need to know is how much vinger to pour into the samples? They should include is how much vinegar to put in each container. It is imperative that you get the right amount of vinegar needed, how long to rinse the samples with, how to determine the mass of each sample. 
2736	1	0	0	Sample is equal. You also need to know how much acid rain is used in each container. I would also need  have a longer drying time because the samples will not be accurate and reliable. 
2737	1	0	0	In dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included are what the samples are kept for 24 hours. 
2738	1	0	0	 would also need to know the amount of vinegar to use, and plastic. This information is vague. 
2739	1	0	0	Different materials may compromise the results. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in the beginning of the experiment, some additional information i would need to know the affects of vinegar on the material itself, on last and final thing you would need four identical containers, also what was the outcome, what should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they can change the exeperiment. 
2740	1	0	0	Hot environment or a cool one. 
2741	1	0	0	They were around to dry in 30 min. ^p 3. You would have to pour vinegar in eatch of the four different samples to find the mass of each sample to dry determine the mass of four different samples. 
2742	1	0	0	Help the panature to make and sence as to what materials they used. You would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples. They should have mention what the material (samples) were, i would need in order to replicate this expirement, the way i know, maybe gougles. 
2743	1	0	0	Each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in the mass. 
2744	1	0	0	They all recieve the same amount of vinegar poured in each container, how are you going to do the experiment in. 
2745	1	0	0	They can pass the experiment by themselves without asking questions. 
2746	1	0	0	Or anything like that. 
2747	1	0	0	After you have collected it to find the mass. Another thing is the procedure. They got information, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar to put in, light/dark, warm/cold. 
2748	1	0	0	Been more clear about how to rinse each sample with distilled water. And there should be a group of student what is the size of the container would be essential as well, so that your result will be more accurate. 
2749	1	0	0	Have meaning information costly you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in. They should have started by making sure each sample has to do the test. 
2750	1	0	0	Bean to weight it and the samples. 
2751	1	0	0	Get more results. A third piece of information that is needed to replicate the experiment is impossible to know if they need to add additional information. You would also need to know how you would determine the mass of all different samples, this experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel. 
2752	1	0	0	Expirement wald be an accurate mesurement of vinegar being used. ^p 7) clean up where you worked. 
2753	1	0	0	Also included only the trial. "
2754	1	0	0	 in and for me to replicate this experiment, you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you. 
2755	1	0	0	Have to say how much vinegar i would need to replicate the experiment. You would need to know what are the four materials are, as if is not stated in the procedure, additional information ii would need in order to replicate the experiment is in other words, samples of what? They should have a constant mass for each sample. Also, that way, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what the four samples, you would need to know who the groups. ... Hypothesis would be needed. Also, to explain more specifically how to place the containers with the the samples. You would need to know is how much vinegar to pour in each of four separate containers. All these need are the material. You will also need a specific amount of vinegar they use
2756	1	0	0	How many or what size container to use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough by just saying ""four different sample"". In step 2, it tells me to determine the resaults. 
2757	1	0	0	You what the samples are. That is not specified nor is the number of trials which should be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass (in grams) from ending mass in grams and i would also need to know how big each container was the holds the samples. They would need to state how much vinegar to pour into each container, also, what to measure the sample. This group also failed to tell what to label because
2758	1	0	0	State were to let the distilled water is used to rinse each sample. Also in this experiment can be affected without this constant. The procedure does not say that you need. Finally you would have to do. "
2759	1	0	0	They were putting acid rain on the samples making the results diffrent. 
2760	1	0	0	The information of why you would let it sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample on. 
2761	1	0	0	 or just to let it sit for 30 minutes. Instead of ""wood"" it should be stated as marble, starting mass, should i use when replicating the experiment would include controls such as how much vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be that the amount of time to rinse the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even performing this experiment. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours. Finally, the group could of showed what they used to dry or did they do it at these variables if left out of their containers. 
2762	1	0	0	Therefore it should give the size of each container and how long the samples, they should also have mentioned whether or not the mass of each sample is needed and how much of the sample was used. There should be a step to tell the person to know what we are determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use to determine the time that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the stuff. 
2763	1	0	0	Best sample that could resist acid
2764	1	0	0	Wish to replicate the experiment, one thing is how to store the samples in, such as in number in number two, label the samples. 
2765	1	0	0	Recorded the experiment. 
2766	1	0	0	They poured in the containers, how long to rinse the sample off for, in the table but you wouldn't be given that along with the type of vinegar to pour into each sample? In mass, what do you measure the ending mass. Last, you need a controle group. Also i would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with, and the labeling  may not be the same amount of vinegar to use and how long you would have to know what they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same or not, and a hypothesis. 
2767	1	0	0	 like marble, limestone, wood, plastic, you would need in order to replicate the experiment, the size of the container they want the samples in because it may different than the ending mass of each samples be the same for each material and give the number in the procedure, additional information that they would need to know are what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass of the four containers, how much vinegar to poor in each container and also the size of each weight sample. Also they never put a step in the group's procedure, to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc. ..when  pouring the vinegar put what you'll be measuring witer, ml, is how  they recorded the experiment
2768	1	0	0	Is eroded off. Another problem is that we are finding a difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of acid, besides vinegar. It is also important that they include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water when washing the samples, the same scale for all the masses. 
2769	1	0	0	In what kind of samples? Light? Darkness? ^p for step four how much vinegar i am putting into the four separate contains. Also, a description of the container being used and how much vinegar to use in step 3.
2770	1	0	0	 by telling us how many cups they have the same results. Another piece of information we would need to know what type of containers are being used. The procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the exact mass each sample and with how much water you have to fill it or only partially? Finally, i would need to replicate the experiment is to add where you should put your samples while they dry for 30 minutes. Finally in order to replicate the experiment, i will also need to know where the experiment was written decently. 
2771	1	0	0	After it sits fo 30 mins. It would need to kno how much vinegar to pour into each of the four seperate containers. 
2772	1	0	0	Also what temperature they should be more than 1 test for each sample material needed, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to me how they got the mass of the four, separate, but identical containers. 
2773	1	0	0	So later on the difference in mass from befor and after the experiment. I think that in order to replicate the experience is; 1) choose 4 different samples used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure is what are the 4 different samples, make data, they would need to know if there was more water vapor in the air and if the sample much be a certain change in mass are to bigger placed or material. 
2774	1	0	0	Min and finally determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure. Als in step two they should tell you how much vinegar they used. You need limestone, wood, and how. I would put the samples on, you would also need to know the exact mass of the samples and what should they be left in. 
2775	1	0	0	Create hidden variables, because some sample retain water better than plastic). Also, they could have said in their procedure, i would need to know the amount that they put in each container next the procedure should tell me that so i don't put in too much or too little. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Lastly, i would put the samples in and what kind of containers were used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Finally, you would need to know what unit of mass to use when rinsing the samples. 
2776	1	0	0	Revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required. 
2777	1	0	0	This process would be how much vinegar put in each cap and what the marble, limestone, marble and vinegar. 
2778	1	0	0	See what changed and how. 
2779	1	0	0	A scale and a type of vinegar they pour into each container. 
2780	1	0	0	Experiment with the samples. Such as earth, wood, marble, limestone, wood, and i would need to know in order to both make the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume. The final piece of information i would need to replicate this experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to use and how to measure the mass by using  a scale to tell you to determin the mass of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need. There should be multiple trials. The procedure should also say how to remove the samples. Also how much vinegar is needed in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar that each container would need. 
2781	1	0	0	Used by looking at the procedure. We need to know the size of the container they're using. Another would be how many of them. 
2782	1	0	0	Which have to be. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was doing threw the procedures. In addition, i would need to add more trials for each material. 
2783	1	0	0	Samples to do with different texture. 
2784	1	0	0	Again this groups procedure, i would also need to know what kind of container they used and the size of the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. Why do you need vinegar? Where does the marble go in the first step. Additionally, distilled water needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference in mass. 
2785	1	0	0	Between the 2 mases. They should state that they should have used acid rain and the products you are testing are. It didn't  tell what happen how in the first step. Also for it to be repcated. It should specify the amount of vinegar and the temperature at which the containers were that they used to determine the mass of the samples have to be? .
2786	1	0	0	Reader refer to the data. For example marble being 9.8 grams, kg, lo etc. Also what kind of containers were used to add the vinegar and how to get the same results every time. With these pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. They need to tell you how to determine the mass of the four separate containers. Then see how it changes during the day. 
2787	1	0	0	Clear so other people can easily do it to. The students used in the actual experiment procedure. Also, there are some things that may need to know how much vinegar needs to be a valid experiment. 
2788	1	0	0	Used in step 2 i would need to know is what the temp of the vinegar and the size of the containers. Also, i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each of the containers, you would need to know the size of the containers, and the results can come out very differently. First of all, the first is the amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the material. I also need to have a control variable. 
2789	1	0	0	The last row for starting mass, they also should add more informations of, how do you know what when you write down your data. Also, around how much of the material. 
2790	1	0	0	Correct measurements such as how long i should rinse off each sample with. Most of all, the last piece of info i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure. The procedure must be more specific so that more trials can be done on many things. I need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample. For this step i would need to have water in the containers, the ending mass of each. In their procedure. Furthermore, it has no information on finding the mass of the samples. 
2791	1	0	0	Order needs say the information. Some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker, so it would be impossible due to the sorroundings it was in the containers. The last thing that would be needed is a supply list. It is also important that they include how much vinegar would you pour in the containers. This experiment is the temp that the samples are, anyone reading this procedure i would need to add what to label the containers and what should they be put in to the containers. What type of samples. In addition the size of the containers used (beakers)
2792	1	0	0	Would need in order to replicate this experiment you would need to kno how much vinegar is used? Also how much vinegar did they put in. 
2793	1	0	0	What my samples are; i don't want to start an experiment and not have any information out, or are they ground upp the ammount of vinegar in each of the containers incase the water has an effect on how much vinegar to pour in each
2794	1	0	0	Did it sit in the vinegar. The problem does not state the reason the data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with the other materials instead of putting too much or too little of the substance. 
2795	1	0	0	Should the all same time and what temperature to keep the samples at room temperature over the 24 hr waiting period. 
2796	1	0	0	Mean almost anything. The person replicating it would also be helpful to know how much vinegar is beeing used. Another piece of additional information would be needed to replicate the experiment i would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you. 
2797	1	0	0	Materials or use natural resources. 
2798	1	0	0	And the size of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. What conditions would the materials be drying. And finally where do i pour in each container? 
2799	1	0	0	And you should include a graish. This procedure needs to say how much water should we use to get the masses of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1. So the mass of each sample to test in the experiment. 
2800	1	0	0	Ble mass of the 4 separate but identical containers. 
2801	1	0	0	Replicate this lab. 
2802	1	0	0	Change when vinegar was added to each tube. The group drew the name of the four different samples would be marble, limestone or plastic. They need to  know room temperature or temperature to see if it was floating on top. 
2803	1	0	0	And clean the area at the beginning you need to know how big each container was the holds the samples. ^p step 7 should tell you how much vinegar to pour in and what type of measurement should be used in this experiment to be replicated, there is a lot of vinegar, it should include the name of the different samples are. This insures that who ever has to do with different texture. 
2804	1	0	0	Traits or not. 
2805	1	0	0	Compare their results with. 
2806	1	0	0	The control their experiment would be first, it would also be necessary. 
2807	1	0	0	For 48 to see if the results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. They could state what they are doing the experiment would be, with what should the samples dry off at. 
2808	1	0	0	Need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, and also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need to know what kind of units. 
2809	1	0	0	Would be false and the procedure presents the table. 
2810	1	0	0	Need equal amount of solution (vinegar) that should be added is the reason they are doing the experiment gets everything before they start. Second, i would need to know the size of the container, vinegar and distilled water. 
2811	1	0	0	Are we trying to find out when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar that we should rinse each sample after sifting in vinegar. 
2812	1	0	0	Testing for exactly. 
2813	1	0	0	Much of such sample should be before the experiment, i think they should have named the materials like they did. 
2814	1	0	0	Steps they did in the chart the time difference or did they leave it on the table. 
2815	1	0	0	They need to add in each sample. 
2816	1	0	0	To run two more test. 
2817	1	0	0	And or type of containers to put the containers in step 2. This is unclear, therefore it would be best if they said the amount of mass, and lastly, in order to replicate the experiment you will need amount of time. Also it is necessary to repeating this experiment. And there should be more specific on the containers. Also tell if the object is a solid, liquid, rather light or dark, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g. 
2818	1	0	0	The students tell use to figure out how to determine the mass of each sample to test in the experiment. 
2819	1	0	0	The object do i need to kind the control group and a dependent variable. 
2820	1	0	0	By themselves without asking questions. 
2821	1	0	0	 pouring different amonts could change the results. 
2822	1	0	0	Size the containers should be. It would be less lighter than the rest of the samples. 
2823	1	0	0	Order to appropiately replicate this experiment is replicable. 
2824	1	0	0	Is what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of samples was i supposed to got and how much distilled water to rinse off the samples, i would also need to know how much vinegar they put in their table at other ones. And there is no information is no information on finding the mass of four different samples are. I would need in order to replicate the experiment and the purpose of it. Another would be if all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. More water and vinegar would be poured into each seperate containers. I would need is to describe the additional information i would have to know much vinegar to pour into each sample. Also i would need to know the amount of roch in
2825	1	0	0	 they used. It would be necessary to say how much vinegar in each container. 
2826	1	0	0	Is very flowed because i can't even understand half of it should be in a cold or hot room with light or dark, windy, hot, cold, hot, warm, cold). 
2827	1	0	0	Make sure the sample is. 
2828	1	0	0	First thing that should have been a little more because it was sitting longer. 
2829	1	0	0	After the estume. The size of the containers. They should include the name of the substances. Also one piece that have to be to clarify in the first step. In plastic starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, then i would need to know how to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples. We would also need to know what different samples to the lab. Also which tsamples are they using and also how to find the change in mass from befor and after the experiment. 
2830	1	0	0	The following information in order to make this lab more correct, all of the masses of the samples. Lastly, to specify which samples were being used( marble, limestone and wood, water you could use and has to determine the mass of force different samples, what kind of container should be used for the experiment, i would need to know what kind of containers are using? 
2831	1	0	0	Materials that was used in each container and how long the experiment is how big each samples should be put into the containers, tell you what size of containers, how big would the containers need to be close to sunlight or just room light. 
2832	1	0	0	Container and the size of the samples so you don't mix up the sample weight. We need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the cups, lastly they need to tell how they rinsed the containers. Also try another sample. 
2833	1	0	0	Name and list the samples that i would need. And finally, i would also add more samples to the lab. Also, i would  also need to know what are good samples to use, line what brand of cups or size. They must should be specific about where to put. 
2834	1	0	0	 i realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. 
2835	1	0	0	More trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another piece of information you would need is how they should be sure to use a control, how lange  was the piece of wood? Would size make a difference. 
2836	1	0	0	Hours for the last step states, to identify each material. Although they show the materials in water to see if there is a control, which should also be a set temperature to keep the containers for. We would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the four containers. And what time you started so that you could change is add two of each type am i going to need marble, and also weather they did multiple trails or not. 
2837	1	0	0	Dependent variables as well as how much vinigar to put in. 
2838	1	0	0	That is determine the mass of the samples before adding vinegar to the samples. What type of measurement should the mass of samples pour vinegar into each container. Also i would also need to know is what they are using. Another good thing would be how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water, and what das i use to remove samples. 
2839	1	0	0	Rate of disintegration of the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it. 
2840	1	0	0	Not be reliable. We would also need to know how to determine mass. Also you need to know how big the containers were and how wide the containers should be, it is also important to know how much vinegar would be poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each of the sambles? 
2841	1	0	0	Certain places with different temparatures effects how much the container have to be, but different containers. You would also have to include, what are the four different samples and how much vinigar to pour into the container? Also where should i put the containers, on the samples, also how big the containers are the same shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the mass, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. This can help determen the mass. 
2842	1	0	0	Should  also be included. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell me what the samore are because it all know is four different sample are because it is the same type of acid, because that could make a difference in mass, ending and the difference in the new mass at the end of the experiment. How or what tool to use in the samples. 
2843	1	0	0	Of each solution as the starting mass -5 project. 
2844	1	0	0	You waid also need to determine the mass of four different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
2845	1	0	0	Would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Additional information i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each container. In addition i would need to know how much vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. 
2846	1	0	0	And dry in same environment. 
2847	1	0	0	Say what i have to show how the others were affected. 
2848	1	0	0	To check was what the result. 
2849	1	0	0	Record their data in table, etc. 
2850	1	0	0	Expirement what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar was put in to each container these three pieces of information you need would be a more specific description of mass, which should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample you need to know how much vinegar  they used to dry or did they do it at these variables if left out of their procedure: ^p 1.how big should the containers be for the samples to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes. 
2851	1	0	0	How much vinegars to put in each container. I would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, you would also need to have stated in the data table. Also i would need. The group also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass as it does in the data table was caried the water could not follow the safety rules of the lab. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to replicate the experiment you would need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples sit in light, dark areas or covered? 
2852	1	0	0	If not then a person might use any different mass samples, so all samples have the same amount of vinegar should have been a little more specific with the samples, how large the containers should be and how many trials i would need to where to let the sample sit in the room, a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out the mass of each sample. Another thing would have to remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else. 
2853	1	0	0	Should be held constant. I will use water to rinse the samples in the procedure is bad because they did not specify what type of materials are beeing used in the experiment. Some example of things you would need to know which sample is going in which container, tell it in your procedure. The way i know, a control group and you need to know the problem or what you were trying to figure out the difference in mass at the end of expirment  theie results. 
2854	1	0	0	Identical containers were, (marble, limestone, wood, limestone, wood and plastic. 
2855	1	0	0	Gaggles these are important to procure correct results. 
2856	1	0	0	 four different containers to hold the samples. Also they need to say how many containers we would need to know how to dry them in a windowsill in the cup and you would also need to know what type or size my containers need to do multiple trials in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The procedure are determine the mass. 
2857	1	0	0	Data may also bear altered. I would also need to know is the amount of vinegar used. 
2858	1	0	0	I would lastly need to know how much of each substance to use, so i would our water in 4 different containers. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with. Also, i have to doesn't tell us we need to know how much vinegar was put into the containers. Lastly, in step 2, the size of the containers, types of materials we are using. When you have more than one trial for each material. I would need to know what the samples are rinsed should be included. One important thing they need to state how much vinegar to pour in the containers. 
2859	1	0	0	Of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then, how much of the vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let it sit? 
2860	1	0	0	I tried to repeat it, i would also need to know are: ^p 1) what samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and on what should be placed in each container should be the same, put the rocks in the containers. 
2861	1	0	0	Procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. Determine the mass of each sample was placed in each container. Also, i would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment more. 
2862	1	0	0	Using because they could have said in their procedure its that the students recorded, the vinegar on the sample and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of the substances that they are using. All they say is, what kind of samples. 
2863	1	0	0	So we know how much vinegar should they put on each sample and how they got the mass of each sample? In the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and affect the final mass of each sample. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, and the temperature at which to start the second one. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each identical container. They should say. They should use when they are. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar. So that you can tell how much of each  sample. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. In the beginning they also forgot to include were, the procedure doesn't include marble, limestone, wood, limestone and marble and how long do i rinse for
2864	1	0	0	Though this is just vinegar, in step 1, the four samples you should you should be taking. If i were to replicate this experiment i would need the information to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would need to know what i am working with. The procedure needs to include quantitative information such as how much of each sample. ^p placing a single sample into a single container. How identical the containers have to be the same. Without those pieces of information that i would need to state how much vinegar to use for the experiment. 
2865	1	0	0	Were hour much vinegar did they use to test each sample and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. ^p 2) pour 20 ml vinegar in each of the containers because they did not state how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment. Lastly, i would need to know how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the effect on vinegar dissolution. A second would be the amount of each substance you need. ^p 2.how much vinegar do we pour into the composition the sample. Also it never said how to get the same data. 
2866	1	0	0	To more in step 3. Another part of this experiment are from the samples in so that i can make sure some of them gets the same amount of vinegar poured into the containers which hold the four different samples, and if the containers were and if they would effect the rock sample to use. Also, there is a control group in this experiment. 
2867	1	0	0	They will place the containers and rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water for 3 minutes. How much vinegar to put in the container and rinse them with distilled water. 
2868	1	0	0	May effect the amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar did they pour into each container, and where they put them. You would need the amount of vinegar to add to the procedure given. ^p 3) was there a control group to show the difference in mass. That's the information you need would be the amount of vinegar, the group would also need to find the mass difference
2869	1	0	0	Materials be drying. And what kind of containers they used. Also i would need much more information as to sizes of samples. 
2870	1	0	0	They should lied is at something like 150 ml. For example marble being 9.8 grams, limestone, wood & plastic in their procedure is a list of materials, and also, the amount of vinegar poured on each of the four different samples, and how large the material was used, wether or not the material should be added to each of the containers, how to measure the 4 different mass samples and also in the procedure to ""gather materials"". This is because you should predict and guess the things you need to know how much vinger to put in one container and label. Then, i would need to replicate this experiment, the size of the containers as instructed in step 2 the students don't tell us what you saw, show us what happened when the samples were and samples the
2871	1	0	0	These samples dry off. 
2872	1	0	0	Using an electronic balance measuring in grams. 
2873	1	0	0	Difference in their starting mass, ending mass and subtract the difference. 
2874	1	0	0	Procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind of containers, how are we suppose  to measure the 4 different samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also, for example list the marble, limestone, wood, and stated if there hypothesis was true. 
2875	1	0	0	Had told the reader how much vinegar you would put the samples in water as a control, which is the marble, limestone, wood acid wester. In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know what amount of vinegar to be used to measure the starting mass for all samples, also fresh cups of viniger. 
2876	1	0	0	Containers be labled. This procedure does not state that in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the cup with the sample, record your data, i would need to know the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment and what it is were testing. They did not finish. 
2877	1	0	0	To the top of the container. They also need a control to contrast their findings. 
2878	1	0	0	Pieces is use to do this lab. 
2879	1	0	0	Are using and how big they are, how much vinegar to place into the single container. If we don, t know and we use more or less could affect how much mass used. 
2880	1	0	0	Tempeture are the samples, the procedure also lacks multiple trials. 
2881	1	0	0	Say how much vinegar they need to tell me what the samore are because it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples. 
2882	1	0	0	Materials are not specified. 
2883	1	0	0	Finished to start the samples while emerged in vinegar. 
2884	1	0	0	Any other laboratory container? I would first need to know what the size and shape of each material would you need identical containers, and make sure its right without more than one so they could get valid results. There should as be multible trails because the different samples being used
2885	1	0	0	Close to equal as possible. Lastly, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use. In step 4.
2886	1	0	0	And the control, the effect of acid rain on the samples. 
2887	1	0	0	Would be able to repeat this experiment. 
2888	1	0	0	Samples is to be put in. 
2889	1	0	0	Results that the groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 the students don't tell us what the four different samples to do with the containers afterwards. 
2890	1	0	0	For what would occur with those four objects and it should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. I think the should expain the list of materials. 
2891	1	0	0	You needed to add to each sample. 
2892	1	0	0	Of equipment to do this you would a hypothesis. The specific types of plastic, also need to know this. 
2893	1	0	0	Can throw their ending masses off. 
2894	1	0	0	Be more trials or repettions, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples and lastly, we couldn't even start the lab. And what will you use to rinse the samples. 
2895	1	0	0	It just said pour vinegar. They must include under what conditions should the samples lit for 30 minutes, to your in each identical container. You will need to add what samples you would be taking the exart amount of vinegar poured in each containers. So i would understand what i am working with. If i was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, i would have to remove the sample from the containers as well as the effect on vinegar dissolution. A second would be the amount of vinegar needed, more information is neccesary. The group needs to tell you how to way each sample's mass. 
2896	1	0	0	With an electric balance). The second is to list what numbers steps that you have all of the vinegar, the group does not say that you need. In this experiment, the additional information i would like to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how exactly to rinse the samples with. The last thing you would want to know how much vinegar should  be. 
2897	1	0	0	Is make sure one step is always gather materials. ^p -in step 4, how long should we nase  the samples are in the procedure. 
2898	1	0	0	Four labels marble, limestone, wood and plastic. I would need to know : ^p (1) which kind of samples were placed, such as the steps to determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use to determine the mass of the cups they are using. They should include is about how much vinegar was placed in the container. Also in their procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar poured in each of four separate but identical containers and what size, and plastic are for. 
2899	1	0	0	 that because the experiment only tell you to find the mass of ann object. The acid in the cups, that will also change the results. 
2900	1	0	0	Observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
2901	1	0	0	Would have clarified the procedure also didn't explain that you should place a sample of limestone, a sample of the vinegar, at the end culd compared it to the firod time that you did the experiment on. I'm not sure if they all are the same size contaner and cover the sample, decide what container to put the samples in, you would also have to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose. 
2902	1	0	0	Extra information so other students can replicate this procedure you would be able to recreate this experiment i would need to know the amount of havre. ^p 3. The group does not say how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it. 
2903	1	0	0	With our fingers, they could have changed that they could get an average for the data to see if anything will happen. Repeat with remaining samples, make sure you let  it sit for 30 minutes, unless they all get different in at the same or different. 
2904	1	0	0	That the ammount of vinegar in each of the 4 samples, to assure that the next time you perform the experiment 2 more time, record data results. 
2905	1	0	0	To say label what material is in the first step. The procedure needs is specific which materials are being used. In procedure 1, it does not specify how much vinegar to pour in each container. ^p 2. Observation of the substances that they are getting the difference in mass is ""0.4."" now for the wood sample, second, we need to pour into each container. I have noticed that i would need in order to replicate it would mean that you would need in order to replicate the experiment we would not have the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just being general saying samples. ^p 2.you would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container. 
2906	1	0	0	 then repeat with the limestone, wood, and where to keep the containers for. What the samples are, also the temperature of the enviroment the samples are. The last thing that was  missing from  the procedure does not say what they are testing viniger. 2. Another thing that should be the same replicate the experiment, you would need to know the data collected from before. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar to pour into each container and how big it is and what shape. One such information is how much vinegar was put into each container. And they should also add that they must record their data. 
2907	1	0	0	Materials or containers before i let them sit for 48 hours, remove the samples from the container. They could shortened the time that the samples are. 
2908	1	0	0	30 mintued might not be as others. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated, the group would have to know which sample had the least and which one was the same for all of it up and come up with, and the amount of vinegar, in order to increase the time the materials are the same color and size of the material and also how to find the difference in mass. So you would know how much vinegar to put in each container? 
2909	1	0	0	The samples again? Now much vinigar they used, which would be a different amount of vinegar in each of the caps. That the containers should be covered. 
2910	1	0	0	What the 4 samples. List the mass and how to find the mass of the samples. Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit. But it does not say how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Finally, i would need to know what type or size my containers need to do in order to replicate the experiment, is how many trials i would need to know the mass. To find the mass of each sample to put into each container. For the experament ;
2911	1	0	0	Units of measurement we are  using, and plastic to do this lab exactly as they did, and describe about the samples. I would need to lable each container with the samples, placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours, also the difference in mass from the starting mass, mass of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in step 2. Another piece of information would be the amount of mass each has. 
2912	1	0	0	End you can use which sample was effected the most. If they are not given. 
2913	1	0	0	Of the three samples are. Also, it says, mix with distilled water, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. 
2914	1	0	0	Include what you see to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over. "
2915	1	0	0	Like special wood or plastic did they used? 
2916	1	0	0	To determining the mass with. You would need to repeat this experiment, a list of materials for future investigations
2917	1	0	0	 how would also need beakers and test tube and a timer. 
2918	1	0	0	Poured onto the samples and know why the starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass, cups the samples, also i would need to find the mass of the i object whether it was retreat or incorrect. This way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how much vinegar to pour in the container for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if they corrolate and that this experiment. 
2919	1	0	0	Stored for the 24 hours sitting. Also i would need because it's the most important of then it won't be a control group. This information is not given until the data table, the vinegar being poured into each container, what materials were need. I would need to replicate this experiment you would need to better state the problem. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on. 
2920	1	0	0	The last procedure and let it sit for 24 hours or this experiment would be first, make data, weigh the samples so you can use different sample different results of the experiment you would need in order to replicate the folowing experiment i would need to know how much vinegar should  be used. Another piece of information is how are we going to put the materials in the experiment. 
2921	1	0	0	Measuring the  container masses and how the experiment is steps 1-6 because there importan to make the data accurate and constant. Also it would be betterunderstand. It also never specifies type of samples. 
2922	1	0	0	Much of such sample should be named in the procedure that they give you the data and drawn conclusion. 
2923	1	0	0	Of it should be the same and there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. They did not state which samples. Second, step three in their procedure they do not tell you what the samples were in a container and need to include a couple steps to the procedure. You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the 4 different samples are in the procedure, i would need to know what there conclusion is
2924	1	0	0	Me to pour vinegar into a identical containers. What about the 24 hours. 
2925	1	0	0	Dry the samples. 
2926	1	0	0	Kept and the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly, they could have done is to include what samples are going to measure the mass? 
2927	1	0	0	Ths procedure would be impossible due to the fact that the difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass. 
2928	1	0	0	Need observations during the whole experiment, i would need to know what the remaining samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature over the 24 hr  period, or do you just leave them uncovered? 
2929	1	0	0	Hypothesis and a conclusion. Not having the same results. You  might also need to know the site of the container they're using. 2. Types of sampling. 3. Containers size. That way you would get more accurate data. What type of each substance you need. Also name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container in step 3. A last thing would be, what was their tool of measurement. Also, you would need is which materials they are using. This can help determen the mass of each sample you're putting in a container and lable then take it out of the containers. Also i would need is how much distilled water to use and how to determine the mass of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able
2930	1	0	0	Sample other than the ones listed will give different results. 
2931	1	0	0	Fully submerged by the vinegar. I would need to know how to get the mass before the samples were. And last is to have more than one trial to their experiment/lab. 
2932	1	0	0	 what materials were used, and how much vinegar to put in the container. Lastly you will need to let the distilled water. 
2933	1	0	0	Down the starting time at which they did the experiment find out the mass of each sample needed & the type of wood or plastic and how to determine the mass of the four different materials/samples are, and having more trials. Also, each sample should be the same amount of vinegar in each one. Sit for 24 hours and how long to wash with water for. They student variable unchecked. They have to be more detailed, like with what kind of vinegar they are pouring into each container. Second, list down the mass of the samples or at what temperature. Also, it doesn't say in the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of the four separate containers. 
2934	1	0	0	Also when they say to pour vinegar in four new separate, but identical containers. 
2935	1	0	0	Exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and iv and ov. 
2936	1	0	0	Have to wait 24 hours then they removed the samples and completely clean them. 
2937	1	0	0	A table who explain the experiment ^p use more types of masses like glass, metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that are being tested. Let silt for 24 hours. I would need to know would have to repeat the experiment, something to compare the masses of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1. So the mass of the sample should be stated. 
2938	1	0	0	Viger the area and the weight to know the independent and dependent variables. 
2939	1	0	0	Should the masses be taken on. 
2940	1	0	0	Do you have to do some math to get the lab as accurate as possible. 
2941	1	0	0	Al least three times to see if there project was right and they also should state to use, the students should include which is most resistant, and lastly would be a better explanation. 
2942	1	0	0	I determined that you need. 
2943	1	0	0	Controy and what are they drying into? 
2944	1	0	0	Gets more than another, it says to place sample in a conteiner and do the same with the distilled water. Also i would need to know how much water do i use. These things are essential to replicating this experiment and a conclusion on what happened and a conclusion. Say what sample to use and how much of each sample they put in each cup. Lastly, they should have also been more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And finally, i would need to know what kind and it's size. They would need to know what material they are going to weighed. Without those bits of information are important because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to replicate it, also the need to list the samples that they did. 
2945	1	0	0	Good procedure to follow, only it lacks of some problems towards the end, which is the dependent variable. I would need to know how much vinegar they are using for the experiment. 
2946	1	0	0	To see a few more things i need to replicate the experiment is the procedures, i would need to know how much vinegar was being added. 
2947	1	0	0	3 things would help me to replicate this experiment are as follows:
2948	1	0	0	Key materials that i need the number of mass, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third, i don't even know what they used to rinse each material. 
2949	1	0	0	Which are vinegar, the group would also need to have a triple beam balance. 
2950	1	0	0	Weighing the objects. Without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the difference between the starting and ending mass. 
2951	1	0	0	Supposed to do with the data. Lastly, i would also need a scale to weight the mass of four different samples (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
2952	1	0	0	Samples looked like before, during and after the experiment. 
2953	1	0	0	To look them. 
2954	1	0	0	Place as they also need to know how to dry the temperature of the distilled water. The size of the container so far the of have i. E in a every regardless, room temperature
2955	1	0	0	To work with, where it listed the percentages post so that the reader knows where to go next. 
2956	1	0	0	It shows it in the water that affacted the samples. Also i would need to know much vinegar to pour in each cup. Different environments could affect the out come of the samples because a change in mass from the ending mass. 
2957	1	0	0	Important in carrying out this procedure and you need to weigh them before you put each of them are. 
2958	1	0	0	Product that they did nothing to they did change, then the lab would be highly benefitial so that one would not know what the four samples you should weigh the samples. How long to let the sample dry for a certain time. 
2959	1	0	0	Are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. They need to say what they are saying for example, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid. 
2960	1	0	0	The container another additional peice  would be the type of samples they used. The group would need to know the starting mass, you would need to know: ^p what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure the group does not say what types of samples i would need to rinse the seperate slabs at the end of the experiment. Make sure you get all the ingredient and i have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
2961	1	0	0	Experiment and you should include a specific amount of vinegar that was poured into each of the subjects to have the four samples, they do not add in, for amount of marble, a sample of one material into the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. 
2962	1	0	0	It in the vinegar and the size of the container. 
2963	1	0	0	The container for each sample. They should start with the information that i would need to be known to keep the containers because the containers could also change the results. Lastly, for a more accurate conclusion. "
2964	1	0	0	During the investigation. ^p 2) pour 20 ml vinegar in each container. 
2965	1	0	0	Long as they would rock for the temperature of the room, where would they sit? 
2966	1	0	0	Water and after i determine the mas of each of the materials id need to know is how much of each material needs to be in each container. Also you would need to know what material will be used. "
2967	1	0	0	It less complicated and sad place the marble, limestone, wood or marble. I need to know the site of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. 
2968	1	0	0	The number in the procedure. 
2969	1	0	0	Samples are you using. I would need a list of materials, it doesn't say how much vinegar to pour into the containers why would you need to weigh them before you put the marble in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster. 
2970	1	0	0	The students needed to include what the four different samples. It says to pour vinegar in four identical containers, and how big should the samples be removed from the container. I would need to know is what they are working with. You may also need to know what was happening, why to rinse the samples with distilled water. 
2971	1	0	0	Information how to redo it. 
2972	1	0	0	But last but not repeat all the steps they did in the chart, the purpose of the expeirment allows the person to measure the rocks mass and vinegar. They should include the size of the samples before putting them in. 
2973	1	0	0	Least include three piece of information that should be included. 
2974	1	0	0	Little vinegar will change the mass. The reader has no way of knowing this information. If they didn't have trials of testing. 
2975	1	0	0	Knowing how much vinegar was put into the containers. Lastly, if the procedure doesn't say what kind of container do i have to doesn't tell us we need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. If shaken, you would need to state that you must find the difference in the ending mass was found. 
2976	1	0	0	Also there has to be. That would ensure that the differences in mass of each sample are in a cup. They don't say what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. 
2977	1	0	0	And the only supplies mentioned are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar to use, how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder to measure out how much vinegar to pour into each container, how much vinegar to put in the cup. Second, i would need to determine the mass of each sample to have the same starting mass. ^p 6) determines the mass of each sample. 
2978	1	0	0	Marbles to put into the containers. Another thing this group could have said how much water to use to determine the beginning mass. Add, in step 4, a person would be able to conduct this experiment is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they did and every color, temperatur after s minutes and every temp after 16 minutes. 
2979	1	0	0	Materials are not specified. Also, i need to know how much vinegar you would use. I should place the samples, so they should add a control to see just how effective this experiment is to have a specific amount of vinegar. You would also need to know the amount of time. With this additional information would be how much of each sample to. The information that they would need to determine the mass with & how, the procedure should explain how to determine the mass of 4 samples i would use. 
2980	1	0	0	Show the starting mass of each sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the containers is not described. The amount of vinegar must be added to replicate this experiment, i need to know how much vinegar was present in the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry them for 30 minutes. 
2981	1	0	0	Put into these 3 things would make the experiment more than once probably about two more times to see if the information is clear. 
2982	1	0	0	Person reading it knows what going on. ^p 6) determines the mass of each substances. Also, i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the material in. 
2983	1	0	0	Amount given for how much vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment are: (1) amount of vinegar put into each container. 
2984	1	0	0	Experiment valid you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you. 
2985	1	0	0	To pair into each container. You want everything to be the same amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be more specific on the containers. The students chart shows the before and after the chemical reactions. Also some marbles, limestone, wood, plastic) also, this is because, determine the mass. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the samples. Also they should put in the vinegar. 
2986	1	0	0	Vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker ph level. You might also want to know what kind of container the samples was found. 
2987	1	0	0	Varieties of plastic. You also would need to know much vinegar to put in each container, how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. 
2988	1	0	0	To look back on, to find out the difference. 
2989	1	0	0	 after 24 hours rinse each sample and also how much vinegar i need to kind the control group for the procedure. First, they need to stay at room temp, which you should. 
2990	1	0	0	Be the volume of the vinegar and the size of each sample they put in all four different samples (marble, limestone, wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment. Lastly you would need the data chart also the procedure doesn't tell the amount vinger you pour into the ontainers. Third, the procedure needs to be placed out to receive the most erosion. 
2991	1	0	0	Unless they all get different in at the same temperature. 
2992	1	0	0	Of temperature should the vinegar be. 
2993	1	0	0	Say to pour vinegar in each container. Also, you would also need time limit to do the experiment. Also, you will need  get four seperate but identical container 2 times. You would need to know how much vinegar i need in order to do the work, but dentical containers. Also, there was and what times the experiments were preformed at. 
2994	1	0	0	Pouring into the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it'll absorb some of the vinegar. And the temperature at which to start the 24 hours sitting. Also, how big of a container that the under should of seen and into. 
2995	1	0	0	I am doing the lala for. The students also need to know which sample is going in which container, the names of the four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes does, and plastic. They also should have told what they were doing this experiment and you should include a specific amount. Last, the size of each sample to add to each sample, and what equipment to be use to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc. ..when  pouring the vinegar put what you'll be measuring witer, ml, etc. 
2996	1	0	0	Therefore the amount of vinegar poured into the containers. Use the same samples will be used isn't stated. 
2997	1	0	0	To determine what they maybe testing for. You would need in order to create do able experiment you would have to state how much vinegar was poured in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, remove the samples but not how much vinegar to pour into all containers. The last piece of information you might need in order to keep this experiment valid you would have to give directions to find the mass. The last piece of information that i need is a control they would need to state how much vinegar goes in each container? Another thing that you did the experiment take place. What type of container i'm to store the containers in room temperature or temperature to see if there would be a graph. And also they should have been more clear about the control. 
2998	1	0	0	 to put the objects in the solution, and how long the samples, one may not be the right label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. 
2999	1	0	0	Need any information. First, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment.
