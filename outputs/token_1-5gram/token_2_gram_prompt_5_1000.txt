20993	5	0	0	Goes and then, the nucleus, the blood  then combine to start to ribosomes. It makes the nucleus. Then it off message that, it delivers the stop codon indicating the ribosome and a polypeptide chain. 4.) then the nucleus, and then it reaches a the cell it is translated from the golgi apparaus and cell, then distconect from the amino acids then made by the ribosomes to breath, past the trna which was told them is it is then it to the second, then sends information to form, and translation. 
20994	5	0	0	On opposite of the stop codon enters p site which signals to build strong. And translation starts with the ribosome. 
20995	5	0	0	Packages and the rna's are built.

20998	5	0	0	Restrction enzyme then takes the body finally the message to trnatrna takes the decoded and uracil, then it to create a defect in a certian amino acids then changed to make another organelle inside the rrna completes the cell2. Delivers the trna, which then has left the codon at a special codon, s phase. There the protien and once the dna.5. Placing them for a stop codon changes into trna comes and are how they are tried to match the endoplasmic reticulum takes the codons can use and proteins. 
20999	5	0	0	Genteic code4. Protiens which is the midocondrion, proteins. Anaphase, the cytoplasm, there that was told it moves to 'unzip it'. These amino acids to the trna leave the newly formed that it gets the other rnas
