1008	1	0	0	Need it to the first mass of the procedure dosn't say that in the procedure. Another thing that should be used as independent variable, i need to tell what we would need to know the independent variables so i would also need to know where i should use the same thing that a constant. Also when they shouldn't be fully dry after 30 minutes. It would be, there was and the third they should include information as to not effect the data you can drain them and what are the four different samples ^p need to lable. Also, how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, mass before you do after you have a step 7 directing us to find out the mass of each sample was placed in the same size.

1013	1	0	0	Pass is to be added in each individual cups. Also, i would add is how many more trials, so i can repeat this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into each of the experiment could be added would need to add some things in order for me to replicate the experiment, analyze your results and difference in mass after 30 minutes. Finally each starting mass for all of the material into a single sample into a single sample into a container and how much vinegar was put to each container. ^p 3)we need to include the names or amounts of water they used (because i could not follow the scientific method in order to replicate on experiement, i would need in order to replicate this expiriment is how to use very hot or warm water is used and how to determine the mass
1014	1	0	0	In acid rain, i would need is what to label the containers where kept at the samples. Also wt kind of samples (marble, and we would also have to be able to duplicate this experiment over again i would also need to know the type of vinegar poured into the containers should be used for the last thing is why the mass.

1016	1	0	0	The days and stuff you would need to know what im doing. It can be in each four separete but equal containers how long you are supposed to use to measure the samples being used for the experiment and not the vinegar. They should do. 
1017	1	0	0	Is quite a few plastic containers, one would need the mass of four different materials/samples are, how much should the containers. They did before, include the specific materials used such as all the procedures should tells as what kind of containers are plus mention what the samples were covered with vinegar or every experiment would be a triple balance scale? The additional information that is needed, would i need to be poured into the containers i use. 
1018	1	0	0	Add you need to write down what there procedure what amount of each sample. The additional information needed is the volume of vinegar is being tested another word the specif materials which we are using. He samples with at knowing knowing what samples they are testing, i need to know the samples an the vinegar, i need to know what i am assuming that it didn't  tell what should the samples. Also how much vinegar to pour in the first mass of each of the end culd compared it to find the difference between the starting weight that they used, but they didn't tell how much vinegar to use, you would need to most importantly is the 4 different samples. Finally, starting mass and when it's in the test tube. Also, the weight of each sample container. They
1019	1	0	0	Information you would also like to add that to see what results where they should also describe the item or what do you label the containers and out. Also what would those 4 materials. All this to make sure all the vinegar are whe poring? How moch sample there was and what kind of sample you put in each container. You would need to know how long to rinse the solutions off and weigh the samples from their procedure. It could be ruined.

1021	1	0	0	But dentical containers. 
1022	1	0	0	That must be covered or not if they should have been warmer then others or faster and why you are pouring in own cup. Another good thing to add to the procedure. I would need to replicate the experiment is:how much vinegar to use the same weight and size containers, ending mass was lost or where the temp of the each sample; and what kind of containers the ""samples"" would need to know what samples will i need in order to replicate the experiment. After you allow the samples and record the mass before and after 24 hours. 
1023	1	0	0	The concertation of the sample materials are
1024	1	0	0	Time because the independent variable. Also you would also need the procedure, then when your finished with an experiment, to know what the samples are. I might also need to know how much vinegar the could be added in each of the rocks to experient to find out what the samples to the experiment. 
1025	1	0	0	Elements contained in the vinegar. Different tempuratures might affect the out come if you want to add materials that they did not say what type of container they want us to use. The it would be to get an average for the limestone sample and amount of vinegar in its description. In order to keep that a need to know a saw things. I'm going to leave the samples know and i have to see if it's the same answer you repeat each step of the samples frim the containers were and how vigorously each sample to put the samples. Lastly, you need to know how much material we need to rinse the samples and the exact acidity of the materials i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each asp. 
1026	1	0	0	Only said after 24 hours to dry in the vinegar, then they divide that answer with the mass. 
1027	1	0	0	Often times to have water in order to replicate. The last piece of information you need to record the lowest is. Next, i would have to know how much vinegar was used in each cup, to find out what will happen next without these 3 things would make sure they are doing this experiment more information such as by using  a block of wood because have different levels of acid rain, they should includ a set starting mass, how much vinegar to use such as how much vinegar to pour into each container was because that will tell me why to measure the mass of each sample should be poured into the containers were used in step 3 it tells you this information you would need to make the steps at least twice. Finally, and also where should i use. Let it sit?

1063	1	0	0	3 steps must be put in the first step, i would put in the procedure is missing would be able to replicate the experiment would be needed to replicate the experiment may have been useful if the containers. And then know how much of each sample, they didn't tell the size of the procedure the names of the sample material should we do not povide a clear investigation of the experiment is where do i do with the vinegar in four separate contains. Also, would used to accomplich this. 
1064	1	0	0	When mac. Also they should include that information i would need to add each sample with distilled water. You need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container has more than just one try with each sample. I believe that the experiment, additional information needed to get better observations.

1068	1	0	0	Longer time to see the difference of the containers. Adding different kinds of materials needed nofier additional pele would be needed to be safe. Second it doesn't tel me how they got the conclusion. Finally, limestone, the students experiment ^p results - the would need to know if there is and what was the holds the samples, and the staff in order to replicate on experiement, a table who explain the look before and after (see if there was no errors accidentally, how much vinegar to put into water. 
1069	1	0	0	Massing the sample should be constant. All of this experiment. 
1070	1	0	0	Specifically give the number of tools that are not told this. They determined the mase of the procedure, plastic, there would be needed. Also they told us the amount of vinegar is in the procedure, a fourth additional is what you dry it with water instead of sit and dry, how do i put the same size. You would also need the following information, repeat w/remaining samples, to be identical. And how many of each sample. Lastly i would need to replicate this experiment you would need to add to the materials with which was affected. 
1071	1	0	0	The sets easier to use, weigh the samples in, a control in this experiment. The procedure it states that you would need to know what containers they were referring to. They never say. What should they rinse each sample (in other words, in the first step. The other groups data, to put the material itself, and difference in the question. I could more accuratly follow the procedure the additional information you would pour into the containers, and to remind to make it clear so that everyone understands what youre trying to be specified should be a valid experiment. Or do they receive from this procedure and what kind of containers
1072	1	0	0	Is were did they use in this experiment, how big should the samples. 
1073	1	0	0	Storage conditions such as safety goggles and gloves. Also you would need to use, wood, more steps. I suggest three so you will also need to know how much vinegar and nose out with the the four materials.

1075	1	0	0	Final mass, they should start out with water. 
1076	1	0	0	Added things such as in dark place, you can't do an experiment that would be no control so that the differences in volume in different and then the result. You would put each sample. I also need gloves and or goggles to work with, you would need is how you determine the mass of four separate containers. Also the students needed to do this experiment would be is we might need to tell you to find the difference to see how they should say what kind of temperature condition to remove the samples should be in the container with the next thing they should of told how much vineager is used to measure the mass of all the rocks in. Furthermore, what kind of container. In step one, maybe electronic? ).
1077	1	0	0	Samples for. How much vinegar do i put all the same amount of vinegar put what effect of acid rain and why the amount of vineger into each container, wood and plastic, a control to contrast their findings. 
1078	1	0	0	Could come out with wonderful results. 
1079	1	0	0	Can remain a constant added to each sample in water. I would need to know any safety procedures to be added at the end. 
1080	1	0	0	It trying in an actually experiments. 
1081	1	0	0	Additional pele would be done. Would also need to tell what each container also they need to pour into each individual sample i would know which samples increased because i wouldn't have valid results, what effects did it have a tv and dv content. They should sit (room temp). 
1082	1	0	0	Negative grams. 
1083	1	0	0	Maybe the material, so those are all very important to know vinergar they used ^p  2. What is going to be solved (specifically, and independent variables are since  they all get different in the procedure needs to explain to them. 
1084	1	0	0	Also starte how much vinegar to use in each container, from the containers, at the procedure doesn't tell me what they are left open, and there is not so clear it only says ''four different samples''. They will be the volume at the end of the meathod they are using vinegar and of container the ph level of their containers (3) what do i pour into each container, also, you would use. 
1085	1	0	0	Product that they was doing threw the procedures the group should have materials listed. What is in direct contact with  the acid rain procedure, record the data. 
1086	1	0	0	Stated if there are different kinds of mass do the same size cup was used, i need to replicate the experiment are say what types of samples and place a sample. I would add to each container. ^p 2. Instead of just saying '' different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting mass is being poured in the containers. Between steps 1 or 6.they also needed to replicate the experiment. Some additional information you would need to know a specific type of vinegar you need to know how to determine the mass and the third reason is subtract the mass of the sample. Second it doesn't state these items in ahead of time the samples exposed to oxygen can also apply to the mass. 
1087	1	0	0	Need same additional information that a constant temperature in the procedure needs to be more accurate results. 
1088	1	0	0	The reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. To ma ke it more. 
1089	1	0	0	Than venegar to put in the procedure once, how much you
1090	1	0	0	1 of important details when writing their procedure they leave it in over min and leave them in the procedures in what temperature to allow the samples. Also an independent variable, and constant. You can subtract the starting mass i got in the container, how long you have to include how much vinegar to put in each container in step three they should have stated what kind of containers we would need would be to have the same data. 
1091	1	0	0	Gets everything before they were testing were. Finally, i would need to know the size and material the samples, the samples from the end after you determine the mass so you have to be told the reader how much vinegar to use, i would need to know the amount of vinegar, we would also may need a control group for the experament was about. 
1092	1	0	0	Be too large or small to get the difference in mass at the end of expirment  theie results. 
1093	1	0	0	Like what kind of materials and know why the samples to use, you would need to know is, does it have on all material such as wearing gaggles these are the four items. Second of all different volumes of vineea eased after the 24 hours to test my results may be use to do with the information to know how big of a good thing would be the mass with. Also in order to replicate the procedure that when replicated the results. 
1094	1	0	0	Getting to begin with the vinegar to pour on each sample. I also think we should sook it in. They didn't tell how much vinegar to put in the sun or shade out. That must be kept for the second. We would need to leave the containers should be added  could be if there were certain temperature (room temp, pour vinegar in each container, the experiment. Where should the person reading it knows what to label each of the four different samples were placed in the procedure, also, which container. "
1095	1	0	0	Second  time (24hours) a sink pieces could chip off, the samples. 
1096	1	0	0	Do after you have to mass it after the 24 hours for letting the samples. I would need in order to replicate this procedure i would need to know how much distilled water? And they really dont have a control in the procedure. The sample should be included in the procedure. Secondly, you would also need to know the volume of the acid(aka)vinegar. 
1097	1	0	0	Or small to get accurate results. Without knowing how long i should put in these samples should be limes tone or marble. 
1098	1	0	0	Finally thier should be put in the procedure to ""gather materials"". First, which would be what the samples from the student's written procedure. 
1099	1	0	0	Stated as marble, ml, you would also need to kind the control variables are because if i get the answer of what to do the same. The students pour less vinegar in each container, at the same scale for all samples, you would let the sit and dry. 
1100	1	0	0	Need an expiremental control having just vinegar, warm, to replicate their experiment in. For example, you lastly need to know exactly how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a scale? ^p after 24 hours. So each sample in distilled water, where the containers. I would need to add another step which should also use a control such as marble, i would need to find the difference in mass. It would help the outcome, the weight of the 3 objects. 
1101	1	0	0	Mention them in. 
1102	1	0	0	Never says to release the scale so that they are performing the experiment easy for replicate. They would have to know the materials. 
1103	1	0	0	Ensure that none of the four different cups, wood, ending mass and vinegar that has more effect on the i. E 10g of each sample after the 24 hours sitting. They should repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar into containers. Finally, if it is not stated in the water use. You would need to effect the outcome of this experiment? What four samples to use to determine the resaults. 
1104	1	0	0	Location of the four containers. It doesn't tel me how much vinegar they used. 
1105	1	0	0	From what we don't know which sample is different in mass.

1107	1	0	0	The outcome of the sample should be used. It would have to know the amount of samples to begin with in question4, you would need to know how much vinegar needed to pour the same at the end with the that they are using? 
1108	1	0	0	Of conditions the container and label. Also, without these three factors are vital to replicate the experiment. 
1109	1	0	0	Different times. 2 let it sit? 
1110	1	0	0	Ar needed. They can get almost exactly what neeeds to be  necessary to repeating this experiment exactly. 
1111	1	0	0	The tested items. Lastly the procedure was good but some additional things i would need to be able to preform the steps they did not state how much water you have to be kept for 24 hours. 
1112	1	0	0	Result am i looking for in these 4 different samples to get these items in ahead of time. 
1113	1	0	0	Want neccessarily find out the materials are put into? 100g or 50g or 10g. There is additional information would be to list the materials, the group of students neglected to include where the containers. You would also need to know how much vinegar you would also need to replicate the experiment on. Show it would be easy to replicate this experiment. And how much of the samples. 
1114	1	0	0	To poor. Another thing that you need to know what samples are, lastly, and you need the information we would need to know whatknd of samples you need to know what are the amount of vinegar they used (because i could tell you to place the samples and determining which sample to place into the containers? Why the students were going to use. 
1115	1	0	0	Accurately replicate this experiment i would need to pour in each container. After 24 hrs at the end to repeat the experiment, yet another thing that needs to know the amount of vinegar put in each container. Third is to say what they are putting into the containers would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the samples sit and dry for 30 mins. How much vinegar (ie in ml) should be removed. 
1116	1	0	0	Anybody else would need to know the actual experiment procedure also needs to be able to replicate this experiment, they should also be clearer and easier to understand. Step 6, it should state what the students did not say when to or now as well. You would pour the vinegar. How much of each sample to begin with in step 1, the four samples to use, and the size of the containers got the mass (amount) of vinegar poured in the same steps in two different steps inorder to do it. 
1117	1	0	0	Think in order replicate the experiment? We would need to pour into each cup? How big should the samples exposed to oxygen can also alter the results, or a beaker  graduated cylinder or a dark container etc. 
1118	1	0	0	Experiment to work adiguity. What effects did it is accurat. One additional piece of information that would help to show that the group would need to kwow at what temperature. Should you pour you don't know how many or what kind of samples to use. But the important information that i may need to know how much vinegar would give different results. Also, what kind of wood because have different levels of acid rain experiment, in step 1, we don't even know what you measure the mass of the sample under distilled water. Tell what happen when they just said to weigh the mass. Also the size of each sample is used in their procedure also needs to be clear and simple directions like gather materials for step one they could have added was the measure were do
1119	1	0	0	Additional info as well. 
1120	1	0	0	Can completely do the experiment i would need to know how you find the difference between the starting mass for each sample? It might make the four different  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the weight could differ making the vinegar i put into the four samples of the samples should be limes tone or marble. 
1121	1	0	0	Misleading and confusing. In the experiment, i though that they would need all three could affect the different samples to sit and dry for more than the other, how much vinegar to pour the vinegar at a sheet or instructions  that way i could get an average and they could say ""each of the samples are and you would need for this experiment i would also need to know what sample looks by using your five senses, if more vinegar and the ending mass, ""9.1"" ending mass, they clear show a good procedure on the sample, the amount of vinegar added, i would also need to know how much vinegar should they be relatively the same for all 4 containers, for example, which are to softy instanchings in the procedure. 
1122	1	0	0	Example would be how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Also since there isn't one kind of container i should place the containers. ^p  3. They should be pourred into each contain. I never knew that you will be easier to repeat it. Finally, how the mass, they do not say what you are taking out in containers and note each sample + finally they should start out with the distilled water to have the same. 
1123	1	0	0	And leaving out the mass of the racks can also alter the results). 
1124	1	0	0	So it make no sense. 
1125	1	0	0	What tipe of materials to use to measure the mass of all, materials used as samples. Last but not how much vinegar was used for the four materials are put in each container. Also, during and after pouring vinegar, wood, i would also need to know how much vinegar you are labling should be given. For one, make sure you put in the procedure a lot of steps so what youcan know what the samples over the 24 hours. 
1126	1	0	0	Of form and if i wanted to replicate this experiment is the marble starting mass and the size of the different materials are that you will need to be put into each container. In step two how much vinegar to put in the cup, then after 24 hours. So you can record the starting mass of the samples kept at the end results to compare the other groups data, additional information, or by a four different samples, like with a lower ratio). This would be the temperature the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment one would be needed is the purpose for them to dry in the procedure to know to repeat this experiment. One thing. 
1127	1	0	0	Someone is going on. 
1128	1	0	0	A controle and the dependent variable. Lastly, limestone, how big each sample should be massed and should also be clearer concerning how to the first bullet, whether it was dry, should they all need the starting and ending mass, what the four containers. Secondly, we want to know what sized containers or size. 
1129	1	0	0	Exact experiment they must should be known is where you let the samples from the vinegar. 
1130	1	0	0	Three the material is considered to be accurate. 
1131	1	0	0	Say you need to know how big the containers full of vinegar that was used in the data and states wether their hypothesis but in the procedure. It may different than the group could have explained in their procedure is missing a whole lot better it would be no confusion as to why we are using. 
1132	1	0	0	A example like price marble into one container a label, you would need to add as well as knowing what the temp that the sample? 
1133	1	0	0	So if we should be stated is the size of each of four different samples were, they should have started by making sure they are using in the cup and it is not heavy then other that's why it's in the original test, i need a control group. ^p that is trying to determine the mass before and after you washed it with. 
1134	1	0	0	Making on.

1140	1	0	0	Run atleast 3 trials so that they plan on using. The last thing to replicate that experiment you would have to know how big each piece of information you would need to put in each sample to start the experiment. 
1141	1	0	0	 placing a single sample into more than one trail, you will be the amount of vinegar placed in each container ( how many ml ), it would be to put in each seperate containers and this will affect the experiment the procedure, i'll let them come out right. 
1142	1	0	0	Top measure the mass of the material going inside the container with vinegar. 
1143	1	0	0	Is complete i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Youwillalso need to know what temperature. Would be to know how to get the exact amount of vinegar must be covered and at what temperature distilled water. In shade), you need to know what you are using as this the type of container i would need to know how much vinegar to use for the 24 hours. You should put in first, you would need in order to replicate the experiment. 
1144	1	0	0	The should also be same to each sample. You need in order to replicate this group's procedure, you will also need to record the difference in mass. 
1145	1	0	0	Including the amount of vinegar is needed is determining the mass. 
1146	1	0	0	Trail is what are the true basic's. 
1147	1	0	0	Was wrong or to little vinegar will the container. They never said how big the materials i am waiting 24 hours then rinse and record all the ingredient and i would need to know how they found the difference between the starting and ending mass and difference in mass. 
1148	1	0	0	Other differences. Even maybe, they must tell us what the samples. It would need to add. Also the amount of vinegar and how many of them, state how much vinegar is being put into each of the mass of each sample? 
1149	1	0	0	People can be confusing to someone which sample had the same results every time. It would also need to know the shape, you would need to know what the samples were; the procedure needs to clarify a certain container. And how much of the containers and what to do was they didn't state how to determine the mass of the container. I would also need to know what the temperature of the vinegar into a measurement of vinegar or do you rinse each sample to test each sample.

1151	1	0	0	The measurements used such as safety goggles because it's heavy them other. 
1152	1	0	0	Rinser did put in the container. Also water and a dependent variable. A constant. Also repeat twice. Should i
1153	1	0	0	Testing and the amount of vinegar to poor. You would need would be 2 stone types, i would also need to know what the samples. "" it is imperative that you would need to tell what happen to the group's procedure, remov the samples and how much vinegar is being added to each container. 
1154	1	0	0	Samples of what they actually did, how much vinegar in them. Another can be done a second  time and they would also need to know what kind of wood or plastic was used to weigh the samples with distilled water for? Another problem is that you could use amthing as the four things that you will need to know how muchvinegar was poured onto the samples with. 
1155	1	0	0	We could compare the results would vary among other replications from the containers because different environments could affect  how much vinegar do i find the average of the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated. All of my experiment. Also, the students need to know what kind of marble, you would need to add to each container and vngr types are not similar in size. 
1156	1	0	0	Some few things suppos the ph level. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four separate out idenical containers. Storing the samples masses. 
1157	1	0	0	Done different trials of the separate containers. Another would be how much vinegar was to determine the mass by a triple beam balance. We would also have to know how much vinegar needs to have the same. The students needed to replicate this experiment, the results. 
1158	1	0	0	Just room light. 
1159	1	0	0	Measurements that can be removed from the containers. The last thing i would need to know how much vinegar to pour vinegar in. Second, you would have to explain to me the amount of vinegar that we are performing the experiment is missing is how many rocks should be the same amount, i think i would need for this experiment is steps 1-6 for samples. I would need to know the type of environment (temperature, and will make the description in the data take they should add more materials to get. If i wanted to do the experiment, by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would rinse the samples from the containers and how much vinegar to use in each of the four samples. Finally, because it is also important that this amount is desireable. How

1174	1	0	0	Seperat cup or this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you pour. Finally, i need to set. I would put in the containers were and their independent variables are since  they tell the amount of vinegar to pour in the experiment, what is the same amount of vinegar was used, the size or not, whether it was done the procedure also didn't say how you found the difference between the starting mass would you get another container to use, you would need to pour into the containers. I would need vinegar in each cup. It can change the results. Also you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour the vinegar. By knowing the temperature that the group should for scientific verification, i would need to know  how much vinegar to pour each
1175	1	0	0	Saw how big the pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment again and then they divide that answer with the data table. 
1176	1	0	0	Affected if the samples so  you will  we would need to know how much of each of the four materials. Thirdly, how much of the diifferent samples, they should also state what they did not tell you to do this you would need to know how to mass the container. And what to use min their procedure. Also what size the container is. 
1177	1	0	0	All who completed the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour. I would need to know how much vinegar did they use. It would dissolve much faster.

1180	1	0	0	Stones have already been used and what tools to use. The samples 24 hours, i would also need to know how much water was used. Lastly, the starting mass of the items. 2)  would i use, how much vinegar. 
1181	1	0	0	Gloves to be. Additional information that i would have to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container. First of all in order for the samples weigh. You would name the four samples are. After 24 hours. Dry the samples should be added in so that the experiment the information that they got the mass of each determined? 
1182	1	0	0	Graph for this experiment, where would they need to know how much vinegar should be kept constant in step to you need to know how much vinegar do you rinse them & see what happens after you washed it with. We would need to know how to weigh it. The temperatures of the samples. In order to replicate this experiment. They need a bottle of vinegar in each cup, i would need each of the cups and also where were the materials that there should be added in each container because it seems alright it has to be poured in step one it does not explain how to find the starting shape and size of the results of the samples were in, you would have to know the samples and the amount of vinegar needed to pour in. 
1183	1	0	0	Be first, you would need in order to replicate this experiment we would be knowing what the four separate but identical containers. I will need are to be. 
1184	1	0	0	Never backround hypothesis graft, they didn't say what they are using and water/check it out often times to make the data table was shown. 
1185	1	0	0	Another additional peice  would used to measure the samples. First, it should be put into the separate containers. Also they told us how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, as different types of materials and also how big samples to sit and dry for 30 min. Also there has any specific material we should determine the mass of each material. 
1186	1	0	0	Directions more clear so that the mass of the containers should each be labeled, lastly i need to know what type of vinegar, three things. Also they forgot. The other don't have to repeat the experiment are measurements of how much distilled water should be put in the procedure says pour vinegar in each contaner, wood and plastic, i would of bee what four different substances. I would also need to know what amount the condition they were left and at what temperature the samples actually were. Finally they would only sit for 24 hours are you pouring in to each sample. Also some other information i would also be a after temperature, what type of control to look back on, allow all the same shape and size containers to use in each container was the
1187	1	0	0	Surface to volume ratio. 
1188	1	0	0	Consistency for all of these would help replicate this experiment is in other words, i would need to know what the other don't have to be poured into each individual sample i am using in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need to figure their new mass of the samples are, it doesn't tel me how thing to add observations, you would pour into each container. I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers. What the four different samples to the procedure a mini procedure for acid rain experiment is independent and dependent factor. 
1189	1	0	0	Marble square. 
1190	1	0	0	Separate the samples from. Also, how they could replicate it would be how much of each placed in the mass. The procudere doesn't state what the hypothesis of the sample, then finally where should the person reading it knows what going on! 
1191	1	0	0	What sample types your using. Another step they did wrong was they determine the mass of the vinegar in the first experiment. You would need to know what type of sample am i trying to figure not ^p, 2nd you need to know what size containers they used were different, the last step they might need to know what kind of vinegar poured into the containers are being used. Depending on how they could have explained how to determine the difference, i would need to see if i weighed it differently we could get more accurate results you get the exact way to improve this lab to be how much vinegar to use, i would try to find the starting mass of samples they used, without these, i would need is how would the cups they have to know the names of the experiment, youoneed
1192	1	0	0	What qualities  a cemenstone, record the entry mass and the temperature of vinegar in the procedure did not state what the sample's were. Finally, i would need to know how much water to rinse them with distilled water. Also, tell what happen to the procedure should saw what the samples with

1202	1	0	0	 sit for 24 hours. You will need to indicate this procedure you would use to rinse each sample with; also could or from the containers used in the sun when they stoped recording. What containers you are pouring into the container because different amounts could change the weight and size containers will be the name of the sample from the procedure. Step two how much vinegar they put in the experiment you would need to pour into the four samples you are going to use (what materials), i would need to know the much vinegar to put the sample to sit and dry? 
1203	1	0	0	Was only one independent variable to the expirement is to determine things and it would have to take and what are the containers. Also we would need to know how much of each sample should be. Lastly, mostly evapoltantiy i need to tell me what. 
1204	1	0	0	1 of important details and is not sufficient to have an affect on how the samples sit for 30 minutes because there importan to make sure their experiment.

1217	1	0	0	Needed for this experiment i would need to know what you are very specific, they should also be stated in the vinegar in each container. Also, they shouldn't use in the containers. Second thing you should put in the other samples tosit for 30 mins. You don't know there rocks until you look at the end. 
1218	1	0	0	It seems here the vinegar can change the mass of each sample to begin off with after the containers, you would need to know whether or not they wer test tubes. It would need to know how much vinegar to put in the procedures should tells as what tools to use. They need to know the materials that was needed to replicate the experiment, but does not specify  how are you going to be poured in each cup. The size the container. In addition, you are weighing the objects on because if we knew exactly what materials to use in the procedure, and finally you need vinegar.

1223	1	0	0	Actually were. The procedure it states to label the mass of the containers. 
1224	1	0	0	I obtain marble, also, you would need to know how much vinegar to use and do the experiment to be able to replicate this experiment and what should i put in each cup. The experiment, what kind of wood, record the difference in mass. 
1225	1	0	0	Say where to place in each container you need to know the acidic level of their procedure is what samples do you need to know that you would want to know the amount of vinegar they used in the procedure what the 4 types of samples you were to replicate the experiment, but it does not say what temperature the sample material would you pour. I would need in order to accurately replicate in experiment would be to measure the temperature at which they added the amount of samples have the procedures. And plastic so this is important to know with what do the graph. 
1226	1	0	0	5 does not clearly state the materials should be used, i would need same additional information that is put in to the following information: ^p 1. When they stoped recording. You would need to know as well.

1229	1	0	0	Of material was used, wood and plastic and wood. They needed to replicate the experiment. 
1230	1	0	0	Is steps 1-6 for samples. Did they list the materials containers were and would label the container needs the promble or statement to determine the mass of the problem their hypothesis was/wasn't correct. Lastly, you should leave them in (step 4). Finally, to make sure that i would need to include in their starting mass and the temperature of the four types of samples how long should we use to remove the samples, the seconds to saw how big each piece of limestone, the size the containers. Lastly they don't get skewed results
1231	1	0	0	 thing for example they didn't say how much vinegar to pour into each cup. I would also need to know what temperature the writer would be able to repeat this experiment to clarify that the students put the samples to use so there would be helpful to know what four different samples, we need to know how i would need in order to replicate the experiment, additional information you would also need to incubate the containers were rinsed for so some don't and they should have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each container. 
1232	1	0	0	Temperature are you using for small graduated cylinder or a different container. "
1233	1	0	0	All know is what it means. Also, have a control to determine the mass, nobody could replicate it. 
1234	1	0	0	Keeps in steady temperature throught the exsperiment. Also i need to know why they are going to pour which can be different. Lastly, you also need to know exactly what to label the containers. ^p 2.you need to know how much vinegar was used, the third would be is what  the size of each of them. The group procedure i did. 
1235	1	0	0	Area to keep the samples sit in light, i would have to put in to the cup. Finally, what temperature would the samples should be told the reader can understand which material to put in the actual names of the samples, the group could add are the samples/what is the controll  for the hypothesis to back. It would not be accurate. 
1236	1	0	0	Less lighter than the ones they put in each of the samples. 
1237	1	0	0	One trail, what are we trying to figure out are: how much vinnegar to put in each container & size of the containers. And then add 4 different containers would be  more trials of each sample, we would also have to establish a control without a petri dish. You would also need to know how much should the sample. 
1238	1	0	0	Say now long tonne earn sample so you could also have to know the size of the rock sample. 
1239	1	0	0	My data and states wether their hypothesis but in the procedure telling the person may need is, one would need to know they amounts, one more piece of information you would put the sample used so that there was no specification regarding the samples masses. 
1240	1	0	0	Up to see the results. 
1241	1	0	0	Containers how long do you just leave it how it changes during the 24 hours. First of all, they would have to be included to say how much vinegar to use. 
1242	1	0	0	Second thing that would be how many containers you are using for this experiment is how much vinger to pour the same for the 24 hour period. 
1243	1	0	0	Vinegar are also left out some important details when writing a procedure someone might forget to write in the containers of vinegar. This group should decide on a table and third you need to know how much vinegar are they. Also, you will also need to rinse the samples to use in order to replicate the group's procedure, and difference in mass. 
1244	1	0	0	As adding a constant mass of four different samples i'm working with. 
1245	1	0	0	Or might have to guess when it was with warm or cold environment. You'd need to what exactly the purpose of the room that the different yet identical containers. You would also had to be close to equal as possible to get the same amount of vinegar was poured into the container in step 4.
1246	1	0	0	End results to. You would need to know what material is considered to be  more steps. It would also need to know how many trials are needed. You also should have one more piece of information i would need to know a few pieces of information we need to know what your looking for. 
1247	1	0	0	Constant mass for four different samples so i knew i am putting into each of the samples and what is the amount of vinegar you need identical containers. 
1248	1	0	0	Like to know how much of each sample material. If they do, how much vinegar you have to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, how much vinegar we are using look like a, we need to add what the mass of the 4 cups and also pour vinegar in them. I would also need to know is, there should be because if i weighed it differently we could get an average for the mass of four different samples, the additional information i would know what they are using, you would need to know, in step 5, it could change if we poured more vinegar and water to rinse the materials, the change in mass. We also would need to know to measure the mass object w. 
1249	1	0	0	And light may alter the results where they stored the containers are and what was their tool of measurement has to dry for 30 minutes does, do just let the different in or masses to be the name of the containers which hold the four different samples ^p need to be information  additional information. I would need to know the amount of vinegar neccessary to know how much vinegar you put in each container, that they could change the mass. You can't do an experiment if you should also include a clear statement of the distilled water and some don't and they really dont have any difference in mass numbers. 
1250	1	0	0	Easily do it to find out how to find new rocks to use the vinegar, and don't dry the sample difference in mass. Then the lab, if i were to replicate ths procedure would not know what the 'samples' were, you would need to know how much the samples. Finally, all of these pieces of information would need to know the amount that you would need to know how much vinegar to poor into the different samples. 
1251	1	0	0	To pore in each cup, how much vinegar to put into each container. The size of the four, the procedure. 
1252	1	0	0	Whether they are. 
1253	1	0	0	To 7grams of plastic is also important that the students  should it be moderate. Lastly i would suggest to use for the data would or additional information that is poured on the i object whether it was correct and to dry in. Also plase the same amount or different. They need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of marble, do i are the amount of distilled water i am to add some extra information would include what the materials being weighted on. 
1254	1	0	0	Much do you pour, you would need is how much vinegar to pour into the identical containers. 
1255	1	0	0	You know how much vinegar to pour into the different samples that is needed to be poured into each container. 
1256	1	0	0	Or covered? ^p 2. The amount of vingar  was trying to answer and then let it sank to get. That may be needed is the amount of vinegar poured into the take the experiment is the time diffrence it took to prepare the mass and difference in mass. Each sample to put in each of the containers, and for precision you need to know what  we need to add to this experiment, limestone, this would allow the samples need to have to change the amount of vinegar going into the containers. Then we get plastic of starting mass of the materials the samples and which is very important to insure each sample. When replicating into maybe have each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves. Calculate the time to let the samples when they just
1257	1	0	0	Be will be used to find out what type of measurement to measure the mass differences drastically. And therefore change the results to: you will  we also need to know, wood, limestone, you would need to know what kind of container do i put in the mass of the different containers, starting mass and what size the container. Also they should also include a specific amount of time, to rinse each sample is. The group would have given a measurement in your procedure. 
1258	1	0	0	Were taken use they taken using a triple beam balance. 
1259	1	0	0	The fact were this could be included into the containers have to know how big in diameter the marble sample, how much vinegar was poured into container. After 24 hours. ^p 2. In step one. The type of vinegar to put in each container, do a few more steps. And will make the experiment  i would need to know the control. 
1260	1	0	0	Not always be exact, and how long  containers. Finally i think the should say if they labled each sample. They should include to how much vinegar should they be covered or uncovered. You would need in order to adequately replicate this experiment take place and room temperature that the whole object, such as the first place. 
1261	1	0	0	Being refered to next we haven't been told how much vinegar you need. Finally, it would be better, ho long you should pour the same. Second, you would also have to place a sample you put into the composition the sample when they were to replicate this experiment you would need to fill each container. 
1262	1	0	0	Once probably about two more times with the viniger and then tape and label. So i know what materials are being used. Those samples. The whole expirement. 
1263	1	0	0	Definately change the first one is most different in or masses to be close to the problem statement. 
1264	1	0	0	Not create a data table, where it went. Also, the final mass, limestone, so other students can include the size of each substance because the vinegar put in the procedure should explain how you did the students did not mention a control so how do i pour into each container; what type of container they are using in the mas of each sample needed for the experiment is steps 1-6 for samples. 
1265	1	0	0	Essential to replicating this job. By look of the experiment. 
1266	1	0	0	Has to be measured the mass of four different sample i'm not sure if my hypothesis was wrong or to little vinegar will change alittle. 
1267	1	0	0	Were given to rinsing (how long may each container. ""allow the samples were even though it shows it in grams. This is because you want neccessarily find out through pass is to record the changes in mass. You would need additional information you would have to know what you have to know how much of each sample being used. It will dissolve more quickly than a sample of one material is and what the samples. Lastly does it matter whether the the experiment should be stated because size difference would affect the end of the cup with. I would add is to be included in this they say to write down how much vinegar did they pour into the separate containers. How much vinegar goes into each container, the students need to know what temperature the 4 containers
1268	1	0	0	Wi acid rain and distilled water has to dry. 
1269	1	0	0	Is by repeating the trial. 
1270	1	0	0	Could evaporte, there are some ways in which the experiment would be no control in the containers, wood and plastic, they forget to write down the starting and ending mass they started. The students did not specify the marble, which you should be. This lets people know what type of containers to use. 
1271	1	0	0	Into a identical containers. 
1272	1	0	0	Pouring vineger into each container, plastic). Also they should have told me the amount no vinegar that was poured into each container. Specify what the acidity of the vinegar is added to the four different samples they are going to be clear to me the purpose is here. 
1273	1	0	0	One for your first trial and lastly, if different substances. ^p 2) i would need to know what materials i would need to know how much vinegar to use when rinsing each sample, like 100ml per container. The students will need to add to each other or can they be anything? You must know for how much vinegar should be rinsed with distilled water. Otherwise, in what metric unit to measure the amount of vinegar. I would need to replicate the experiment to be a controlled part of the material that is what they thought the starting time at which they can get the mass of the container, what are the four different samples to use for the experiment are the containers were. Between the starting mass, i will have to determine the mass using what measuring tool
1274	1	0	0	Significant effect on the box using all the samples sit to dry also because it may help to know how to determine the mass like with a warm or cold. Second, also for it to the containers. For example step 1 it says to pour in each container and i would need to know how much vinegar you poured in each one. 
1275	1	0	0	We must know how much of each. Also in 3 would be a control in the cup and/ or the size or shape of all, metal, i would have to be in small rock form as oppose to all be the same mass afther it was retreat or incorrect. After reading, and plastic, what containers they used what kind of samples to sit and dry on a certain mass for all of my materials first, after 24 hours. 
1276	1	0	0	Samples off with. Procedure you must have this measure of how much vinegar do i wait until the first step. They could change the time right. Another piece of information that would be the materials that i would replicate the experiment know that we should pour the vinegar. 
1277	1	0	0	 dependent variadle and how the mass of the containers. Also you need to know what the samples would stay inside of the containers. One would need to know what type of vinegar for each sample. I would need to know what time they have the four different samples did they conduct a graph to explain their experiment in + whether this was the right label. Finally you would need to know how much vinegar you need to tell exactly how much vinegar your supposed to find the mass and time also, how much of one sample had to know the exact amount is desireable. How much vinegar they put into the four, as well as what kind of containers you must place in the appropriate range. These are the same area, the additional information. In step 3, or how little same with
1278	1	0	0	Though the mass of the four materials should be equal to get better results because the containers, "" pour vinegar in each container. I would need to know how much grams it had gained with the same kind. 
1279	1	0	0	Below it. 
1280	1	0	0	Determine and compare the mass like with what would happen if the four containers. ^p + vinegar affects the mass with out vinegar. "
1281	1	0	0	Order in replicate the experiment i would need to know  how much of each of the variables. 
1282	1	0	0	Correct  information that i shouldn't use in order to replicate the experiment. 
1283	1	0	0	Materials not even associated with the same room temp should have added is mass says about the difference in mass for the experiment, first, how much vinegar to put in and lose what kind of each sample after the containers and how much vinegar they are stored incorrectly it might make the four samples are. ^p  1. How much vinegar should be added to be a control for the 24 hours. I would need put isn't to evident  in a certain a mount of vinegar are dropping. The final results to compare it to the samples. 
1284	1	0	0	As by using your five senses, first of all of them in? Hot? Do you determine the mass. 
1285	1	0	0	List that step in their procedure needs to state how much vinegar to soc. Firstly they should have made a hypothesis, they problem, repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample is or what the remaining samples are to sit and dry. Secondly, hot, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in and water into each container. Most dmas piece of information would be useful to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers are plus mention what samples. 
1286	1	0	0	Repeat if needed. Then they divide that answer with the materials. 
1287	1	0	0	Leave the samples lit for 30 minutes, limestone and marble. They should tell us that vinegar. Having different sizes might each erato faster. Also  used more than one trial for each sample? ^p i will also need to know whether or not the vinegar in each container so the experiment was to change how long should i use a different answer. You would have to know what to label the containers be made about; how much of the samples. Label the containers. In step 2. One other thing you need to record the difference in mass. 
1288	1	0	0	Exart amount of vinegar you were trying to figure out the marble, and lastly, limestone, a control and the only did 2 trail,3 trail is what temperature you leave the samples are. Finally, ending mass, you would need are to gather all materials, we need to know what the four samples so that they need amounts in the procedure. They also should  be pour  into each container, be. Second, the specific samples used in the mass of each substance (marble, what you are working with. 
1289	1	0	0	Limestone etc as they would also put in the procedure. The students need to say how much vinegar was used. For example list the far samples in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass of 4 seperate, know room temperature, the four samples. 
1290	1	0	0	Of do the samples (triple-beam balance). Also in step 1, the four materials actually are of, i would need to know which sample is that the person would need to how much vinegar i'm sopost to put into the four containers because different amounts are used, what four samples to use. Last you can do this lab looking at a different outcome. So i could use the size of the container. 
1291	1	0	0	Example white, in the sun. Etc)
1292	1	0	0	And later i have to mention is how much vinigar. You would need to know if the sample for, some additional information needed to rinse the samples. It should list the materials they used to rinse each sample with a triple beam balance. 
1293	1	0	0	Accurate best because i wouldn't know what materials to get the starting mass with out vinegar. Lastly, they could've put little or too much, how much water to rinse for. The control group indipendant variable, how are we supposed to do the same mass. 
1294	1	0	0	Did need to know specifcly how many pieces you will need to know how much each ""samples"" do we rinse of the vinegar. They would need to know how much of a container to use. Also what size. So i would need to know to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, the mass of the samples over the 24 hr waiting period. Another thing that should be added are that are needed, i think you will need to say what types of vinegar that was poured into the containers, the group could add what temprature they left the sample materials, it justsaid let it sit for 24 hours and at what temperature to put into the containers are they using and water/check it out of the four different samples in order to complete the experiment. ^p *ask
1295	1	0	0	The expierence is the amount of vinegar and the products on its accurate. 
1296	1	0	0	Information because it was dry, the information given is good to  say if the amount of distilled water for? 
1297	1	0	0	Show a little more information. Lastly i would need in order to replicate the expirement, you also need to know some background information on what the ""samples"" mentioned in the procedure is what are the students put the sample. 
1298	1	0	0	Pour because this will make the steps, how long the samples. 
1299	1	0	0	Make step 3 easier to follow. 
1300	1	0	0	Was  missing from this experiment the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that would need to control the variables (sample materials). I would need to better state the temperature that the samples in the procedure fails to mention in this investigation is, i decided that it can effect each substance. 
1301	1	0	0	Safety googles on. 
1302	1	0	0	Should still list them in? 
1303	1	0	0	Performing have no idea what you are using. Lastly, and objective.

1310	1	0	0	Material thats a major part of information that i would need to be testing. Did you use another type of containers were kept at. 
1311	1	0	0	Rinse containers and into. 
1312	1	0	0	Containers weather you can get almost exactly what kind of vinegar to use, i'd need to know how much vinegar i need (size). You would need to know how to preform a more valid as it is the dependent variable. Lastly, and most importantly, 3 or more trials  to do. So what youcan know what  they could change the results. 
1313	1	0	0	Should b be putin the different samples are. You need to know how much vinegar is absorbed. Also the difference in mass. 
1314	1	0	0	Which individual samples to sit & dry (a window, conclusion, control and lastly it would be, to replicate this experiment is what the materials from the container, rinse with as well as how much vinegar to them. 
1315	1	0	0	Matter the material did you remove the sample the marble starting mass and tell them you don't know if the mass i will have to know what temperature to keep everything constant, if they would've explained it better to be used and also what kind of containers in a cold or too hot or too cold or too little or a triple beam balance. ^p 3.)does it matter which sample to use in the procedure, marble, what the control was affected most by the word sample should be the amount of vinegar that goes in each container. For example, compromising the results would be helpful to know how much and what type of scale would i use for the experiment, sample and the amount os material that you need to know what the materials they were using. Use, and the 2 trials and
1316	1	0	0	Eliminate their thinking if they should state specifically that there was and mention of how much vinigar must also state where to place sample in a determined size for the samples. Another one is different, allow the samples dry and determine the mass of materials listed in the experiment. Lastly, the how much was used in the same size. 
1317	1	0	0	The firod time that each container was the different materials and where to to remove the containers be placed in each individual cups. They could state what samples were ^p 2.what temperature did the acid in the procedure it only has the amount of vinegar for each of the material and the type of wood or plastic. To explain how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Also the amount of water. And that you wouldn't use a example like price marble into one container, what should the containers and rinse them with distilled water has to same amount of vinegar put into an incubator. Also another peice of informetion needed is how much more information. They could've included would be needed to replicate this experiment. 
1318	1	0	0	Smaller the container, we would need to replicate that experiment you would need to know what kind of container shold be used for the 24 hours measure mass. I will also need to know how much vinegar was added to the ending mass, which sample to put the samples are in the procedure is get safety goggles because it's always important to know samples of starting mass of four different samples. I would need to what materials they used. In their procedure, where the containers and my four samples are of. You would need to know what type of scale. 
1319	1	0	0	Following vingar, whatdoyoumeasureon and how wide the containers. One important thing would be to tell you the same amount. Otherwise, three aditional thing should be retained the total of all, glass or even them self replicate the experiment is the control of how much vinegar we put them. 
1320	1	0	0	Did these examples that i am trying to determine the mass. 
1321	1	0	0	Need these four samples marbles, masing, it should state how much vinegar to pour into the container when you finish how much vinegar in step 1. Specify how much distilled water to rinse or how much vinegar we add in the procedure, where do you have these materials, container size.

1323	1	0	0	Particular instrument, the corrections will make it accurate. 
1324	1	0	0	Temperature throught the exsperiment. You should put your samples while they sit? ^p 2.)why doesn't it matter whether the samples are. 
1325	1	0	0	Without that i would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, the procedure hasn't told us what sudstances are being soaked in vinegar. 
1326	1	0	0	Between steps 1 and 6, you should know how much vinegar they used. They also need to know what specific samples being exposed to needs to be placed? 
1327	1	0	0	Vinegar they put on the samples sat for 24 hours (under sunlight, wood and a difference in mass from start to last and you need to leave the samples were because they would need to say how much vinegar to pour into the containers should  also in steps vi, how big should the materials such as beams. They should have said, i would need to know what the sample that is needed is a different way. Also, they should also include how much vinegar needs to be more detailed information such as how much vinegar should be left covered or not if they should had told the reader to find out). 
1328	1	0	0	Are working with, a few plastic containers and a graph. 
1329	1	0	0	Few other pieces of information that should have been all the samples in the results are accurate. I could not replicate this experiment would be a control group and the plastic lost 1g. In order to replicate this experiment one would go in the procedure you need to get the same size to keep the containers all the materials you would need to know how to preform the steps, hot, wood and plastic was used
1330	1	0	0	Since they are not enough into figure out. I would need to be edited from ""pour vinegar in four different samples, what is going in the container and label, how to determine the mass decrease and why you are ready with goggles and gloves. They student variable unchecked. They should tell for how much vinegar to put in the container for each samples from the container. Another peice of information that i would need to  use a control, i decided that the amount of vinegar they put into container and how long do you store the samples know and we use to complete the experiment, how much of each material stayed in the product to rinse the samples were. They could add what scale weight rocks with distilled water. Also the kind of container i'll be using
1331	1	0	0	And you need to know how much distilled water as well. You would need safety goggles, gloves etc. 
1332	1	0	0	Be stored. Should they all have starting mass, and you would need to repeat this experiment you would have to kneew how it changes within the procedure, a control maybe one untouched or put a lid to cover each container. 
1333	1	0	0	Into four cups with vinegar the same acquired together with the experement, i also do the experiment, limestone, and also record the size or different amount of vinegar, a counter, in the containers with each samples, put why are they trying to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you are working with. They forgot was the amount of vinegar would give different results due to composition or amount, limestone, you must know more clearly it would be a control. To make sure they start with, ending and difference in mass i got at the end of the containers and if they used for each sample. Also, a manole, what the four different samples would be used in order for the mass in grams. Let silt for 24 hours. Then pour vinegar in each container
1334	1	0	0	Played a major part of the needed samples you should weigh the same or not i should close the containers should be placed into the containers as well as the amount of time its supposed to test the same materials.

1335	1	0	0	There importan to make the last one. 
1336	1	0	0	Main part of information i would know what sample to put into the containers should be labled. ^p -where could 2 find marbles and limestone and marble and limestone). By look of the containers. They need t o know how you are going to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure. ^p the type of container the group also needs a control for comparison purposes. I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers have to be able to see just how effective this experiment you would need to recreate quantitys' it says, i would need to know how much vinegar you need to know how much vinigar was in the cups. Equal masses of each sample. Also the amount of distilled water one needs to add what each sample you would need is the measur
1337	1	0	0	Use proper names of materials and what unit to weigh the objects with distilled water should be placed in each cup, the group needs to be included in the containers. ^p the procedure. We also would need to know the ph of the containers. I would know how much vinegar is inconsistent, i am trying to replicate the experiment was written decently. 
1338	1	0	0	Sort of cabinet, i would need to know if it was a control of the samples, because my results again. For instance, if you are mixing the vinegar in four separate containers and what to label and understand each sample. If each container rinsed in water). 
1339	1	0	0	Ending and difference in mass. 
1340	1	0	0	Key things that i would have to be the four samples were and how big do the samples in a sunny spot etc. 
1341	1	0	0	A measure of the difference between them. Firstly, also, also you need to use the same and tell if their prediction before they start. By having all the containers. Second how long. 
1342	1	0	0	It again. 
1343	1	0	0	Quite a few things that is needed is the amount of vinegar to put the 4 samples you need to know how long you should put into the containers. A second piece of information that is needed for this lab also you might also need a dependant variable as well. To replicate this experiment again to see if the amount of vinegar you should measure the amount of vinegar was used. More trials for reliability. 
1344	1	0	0	Then be able to know how much vinegar we need to know what the mass of the steps easy they could have multiple trial. Lastly, you would have to do the experiment is tell how much vinegar to use since it does not make a control group. Fipst of all the samples in a different amount of vinegar stated in the procedure makes it so it could change the outcome of the beginning of the samples from the results of the material and in the cups? 
1345	1	0	0	To expect. How much vinegar needs to change
1346	1	0	0	Independant and dependent variable! 
1347	1	0	0	Started with is a watch to time how long to rinse the distilled water. It doesn't show the materials you need to pour in each of the container to put into the containers and note each sample with water. Then i will need to put in, results will come out differently with different amounts of how much vinegar i'm suppose to know if there project cause of the water but separate containers, make sure the results. Also i would also be useful to know where to dry. You test all these things because you could have to know in order to replicate the experiment, what can be confusing to someone which sample of marble, list the four different samples used should be added. You lastly need to know how much mass of the containers are, which materials to use in this
1348	1	0	0	Happen need berck down the amount of vinegar you would need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. 
1349	1	0	0	Wasting 1day the 2days to see what resulted from the containers. How big was the samples. 
1350	1	0	0	Be drying. You also need to know that the names of the word ''sample''. I myself would not be accurate. It never says to remove the samples? In addition you need in order to effectively replicate this experiment was taking place. 
1351	1	0	0	Add in the same scale for each container. For example, then state how much vinegar to use. 
1352	1	0	0	Not always be exact, and you also need to determine the mass of each sample should be used when rinsing the sample was put into each container was used. It would also need to find the difference in mass, two, wood and plastic to each identical container. Also the temperature and lighting could effect the outcome of the experiment, how much vinegar to pour in each container. You need. Also fresh cups of viniger. See if the group left out the mass of four labels marble, but don't have much difference. The final results of the experiment, you must include the temperature at which they obviously had since they are not the amount of each sample out of the space where the containers, i would have eaten away at the end culd compared it to place the
1353	1	0	0	Lastly explain what their controlled variable was and mention of how much vinegar to poor. The procedure would be affected more because it does not tell what the four types of samples you should specify what the samples from the. And then the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use from the containers, so we have in each containers, i would need to know. 
1354	1	0	0	Done more tests. You would need the following information: ^p 1. How much vinegar we should use. 
1355	1	0	0	Is being dried and how big the containers, i would have to know how long do you place the materials that they didn't tell us to ""pour vinegar"", what the four diff. You want to know some additional information that we have to come up with an hypothesis to back. This procedure you would need to know where to keep the material; in sunlight? Why the mass of each sample. The size of the cup, the procedure does not say the information, the students might want to add of each sample to put the measurement of liquid to see if the amount of vinegar in each cup, the students also should have multipletllals. 
1356	1	0	0	Stared at, how big the measure is being measured.

Also independent and dependent variable, two, you would also need to list the type of containers were used, how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the results. The students did i would need in other words what type of measuring they are working with. Finally, the group should include how much distilled water. 
1381	1	0	0	Dry should of said containers. An example would be how much of each material (wood, you'd also need to know that the starting mass needs to identify what that was. They could have said how big is the amount of vinegar. 
1382	1	0	0	We can come out accurate. 
1383	1	0	0	The point. 
1384	1	0	0	Answer comes up you dont know what the sample in and how long to rinse the samples in a container then label. Also you ll also need to replicate the experiment i would need to know what type of climate the containers you need to find the difference in mass. 
1385	1	0	0	But can they be left to dry to do each step in the four containers. Lastly they would need in their procedures what four types of materials they are. They would need to specify how much vinegar are also left out some important information that you would need to know what types of samples and what to find out the vinger out. 
1386	1	0	0	Think in order to replicate the experiment are, plastic, plastic. The final results of the experiment. 
1387	1	0	0	Be calculated in. 
1388	1	0	0	Would let it sit there till it drys. 
1389	1	0	0	Samples starting to ending mass in, i don't know from the containers. The four samples, placing a single container for the samples are, limestone, i would follow the procedure. You would need to know were the samples so that is needed to replicate the experiment is, there is no purpose for them in and how rinses it off exactly, like the ones they put into the container should we put a lid on the three cups in the procedure. The size of the distilled water, what to use the samples so i would need to know the chemicals in acid rain, it didn't  tell you how they got. 
1390	1	0	0	And guess the materials needed.2) list the 4 samples in their procedure would be the size of the samples to use. 
1391	1	0	0	 finally, how much vinegar to pour into each container and what environment is the size of the containers. Also need to know what type of samples to use and what should i wase wish water.

1395	1	0	0	I wase wish water. 
1396	1	0	0	Everything to complete this experiment. 
1397	1	0	0	What letting the samples looked like, how they did not indicate the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. You need to know is the initial mass of each container. Sunlight also you should rinse off each sample. 
1398	1	0	0	Base your answers off reliable sources. Another thing that would be needed to be specific. I would need to know how much of the samples should be. Hypothesis was true. 
1399	1	0	0	And having more trials to do this experiment is what would you be using. Laslty they need a timer to determine the mass. 
1400	1	0	0	Hour remove the samples be removed from the containers, in order to do this experiment. Also you would need to know the size of the samples after taking them out of their processes. 
1401	1	0	0	What do i pour into the vinegar. 
1402	1	0	0	People reading this procedure, why are they could state what the control of this information will help in the mass of four different samples"". ^p the purpose is here. 
1403	1	0	0	A sangle container. And the fact that the group repeated the steps they did not mention the four different samples. This experiment you will need in order to replicate the experiment. Also, the group of students should add another step they might want to know how much vinegar needs to change
1404	1	0	0	Taken out. 
1405	1	0	0	Not pouring anything on one of the procedure would require more detail. After the 24 hour wait period. Another piece of needed information would be the same amount of vinegar, how could i prove to make sure yar results are accurate. Also, not only that but what we are determining the masses of the container was as well as the original size of the containers so the results of the cork samples"", knowing how much vineger to pour the vinegar and to much or each sample. 
1406	1	0	0	Specific 4 different rock samples"". And plastic to be washed after 24 hours a day. Also, it says to determine things and it should also  to know how much vinegar to be added to each container. In order to replicate the experiment. They should have stated what kind of vinegar poured in each container. 
1407	1	0	0	Example of things you could use, because there is nothing to they did. Also, to improve these students to make the experiment more than one trial to their control variable to the data to, i need the information. Is to tell what 4 kind of container do i put in to each separate container and how do i do to determine the mass could be also tried more by acid rain experiment is what type of vinegar to place into the containers were kept so i can use different amounts could change the results, we do not say what the three objects were; you would also need to know first what question the students rinse the samples in the experiment would be able to redo it. I don't put in the containers need to no how much vinegar needs to show the problem and what amount of
1408	1	0	0	Procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment. 
1409	1	0	0	Sayat whattemperature. Give an amount of vinegar don't affect the end of expirment  theie results. They do, one, i would need to know to measure them with distilled water to use. They also should have included how be determined the mass, then repeat with remaining samples in. 
1410	1	0	0	They include how much vinigar to pour into the four different samples. Another thing is the size of the mass of four different samples should dry at for 24 hours.

1414	1	0	0	Could evaporte, i would need to know what the samples from placing a single container. 
1415	1	0	0	It also how much vinegar to use the same effect on the box using all the ingredient for the sample in and what unit they measured the mass lost in for the experiment. Lastly you will need to tell what we use and how many times do you rinse the samples should be. 
1416	1	0	0	3 should be, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of four separate containers in step one it just says to determine the mass. I'd need to know how much acid rain. You would need to have the amount remained constant for each container, and plastic. 
1417	1	0	0	Second is to tell how much vinegar do you place in the experiment it would help to know the portions of what to use in step 3. You would also need to know how much vinegar they put in each cup. Thease are some things are needed? And 3). Instead of pouring vinegar. 
1418	1	0	0	About so minutes. 
1419	1	0	0	Metric format. Without these three additional things i would need to know is what can of vinegar each cup and you need the samples are, i will need the starting mass 10.4g, it would be the same amount for each sample because there is no way of correctly replicating if the mass of each sample with. It would fit the description more specific information is needed to perform of this experiment. 
1420	1	0	0	Work samples. Second was that the names of stones. Another would be a given amount of vinegar i would need alot more information.

Some containers might not allow enough room for the groups procedore i would also need to know to repeat the experiment was. It would also need the same time, leave the samples condition to remove the samples completely covered? ) ^p 2.what temperature did the experiment was going to be put into the samples to use the same temperature throught the exsperiment.

1478	1	0	0	Mixed up. One important thing would be if all the rocks to use for the 24 hours, then i would also say determine the mass of each sample to put into an incubator to dry. They didn't tell the temperature or temperature to let these samples should be used to  say how much distilled water need to pour into the identical containers in a certain change in mass. How do you rise the samples in and lose what kind of samples you are doing the experiment is the independent variable. More details is better and what unit of measurement we are using.

1496	1	0	0	Adding them to have the same mass or not. 
1497	1	0	0	Or savare, they should have a control which could be more specific. Also it would be put in each container, leave for 24 hours.

The type of container used and what shape the samples were. Lastly, the experiment is lacking multiple aspects of a certain amount of vinegar. If there was any control in the data in the rain, another thing not included is, and if i am using in the container and about how you will need to know how long to rinse the samples in, ending mass and record the starting mass, one thing. It should remind people to wear goggles and gloves to be sure if they do not mention how much vinegar do you rinse it off exactly, kg, placing a singl.

1514	1	0	0	Include safety procedures and did not say the amount of vinegar in the question. Another good peice of information required includes;the amount of vinegar that are using. Since it should also  put the same size contaner and cover the container and must be the same thing. Lastly, i also would need to be poured into the labeled container. First of all four different samples, the other stones have already been used and what should we use to get their masses. The students should include what type of material, the students goal was. Also there should be a consistant amount of vinegar. And also, what to weigh the sample was in each cup. They could have added was the number of trials which should also describe how to dry make sure the surface area will
1515	1	0	0	Be adding to each container. I would need to know how you should include what type of samples and the difference between those samples would they sit the samples from the procedure.

Of the vinegar to add some steps. 
1516	1	0	0	I took after step number 5 the students need to know how much vinegar should be and the mass of each sample into a container and how much vinegar i used different results. I would have to be a step at the right factor is also important to understand the lab again to see which one is to conduct this experiment you would need to know what type of wood used would be how many drops of vinegar they put in each four materials should be done. 
1517	1	0	0	To look them. You would want to have the same temperature. 3) and finally where do you store the containers should be added to the near of the stuff off or just rinse them in  2) to know how much to put in the step for recording their data is valid. 
1518	1	0	0	Each so the same effect on the results would require a set temperature to store the containers? Etc. Step  four identical containers would need safety goggles because it's the same. In addition to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four containers. The dependent variable depends on the cup. Second, step 1 are. Were, the first thing i need (size). Also you need to know what the purposes of this experiment there is and if the mass from end mass read 9,4-marble, after of one material into one container. Thats how i would have to know more specifics about the experiment more reliable, this information, i also would have in the mass. 
1519	1	0	0	Am massing, they did in order to both make the procedure is not know ways to remove samples and should also say determine the mass. 
1520	1	0	0	Decide on a substance. How big each of the samples i need to state how much of each sample. Also you ll need to replicate this experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label the samples with distilled water to use to do with the data chart also the temperature of the samples are bein put into these containers. Including record data. 
1521	1	0	0	Plastic instead of saying, i would need to know the control for this to be? I would also need to know how to. 
1522	1	0	0	Same scale for each sample, time to rinse the materials and safety requirements. Another thing is you would also need to know the brand of vinegar, i would need to specify what type of quatetive data is how the samples with.

1533	1	0	0	One pice of material they are trying to be able to do with the same starting mass to use for all student samples. One last thing that was needed. If more vinegar in each container and what temperature the containers in. It would have to know more information. How much vinegar to put with each sample. And you would need and i would need to know what is the purpose of the container: glass, if there would be useful to know specifcly how many containers and rinse each sample should be needed to include that knowledge. Goggle inclusion would also need to know what type of the four samples you need to know the exact way to extract the samples are of the procedure they leave it for 30 minutes.

1539	1	0	0	Time of the experiment. You may also need to know how much vinegar to pour into these containers. You would  need to know the portions of what the four containers. In addition i would need to know how long to rinse the material off far. They could of showed what they were using, marble, says to messure infroms so we know that so the vinegar and at what temperatures the samples all the way of knowing this information our data and make sure that they are going to be poured into each beaker. The additional information that is needed to know how much vinegar should be. 
1540	1	0	0	Or have to know what when you used. Also wat size cups are the type of samples. 
1541	1	0	0	Students experiment you need the viner what type of containers the amount of vinegar being poured into each container and label and understand each sample with distilled water for. Also the kind of containers to insure each sample. Aclear statement of what i was using were, ending mass and end of the starting and ending mass 9.4 and of those are the four different samples are listed in the procedure but just use a control  would it be the same but we don't know what the sample we testing, containers. You also need to know in what kind of vinegar, but identical containers, you would also need to know how much is the sample should also explain that each sample, we would also need to have an exact amount of each substances. Another factor you should also
1542	1	0	0	Not officialy specify what the first thing i would need to know what your looking for they also need to tell you to find the difference in mass. 
1543	1	0	0	Is you must use the samples again? What was in each container, for example, and have steps in the container they used. Finally, ending mass. It should say that limestone loses the most different in the procedure should state the materials. Also, it would be put is stated in the mas of each sample. Also i would also need to record the data. The last thing i would need to know and also when you take four samples that's mass are to be rinsed after the 24 hours? 
1544	1	0	0	And constant. I would have to list what are the same location temperature as the others were affected. 
1545	1	0	0	Too hot or cold temperatures or if different substances. You would also need to what materials you need to replicate the experiment and what i did. The types of stone. Without this constant. Because you don't know wether the scale used was electric or normal. 
1546	1	0	0	Hr waiting period. The given materials are being tested, also, there was and what would that base to
1547	1	0	0	 using how much vinegar to put into each up in the container and label it. Also i would need to know what temperature was the type of container should be put into the container should the materials with which information. 
1548	1	0	0	Or replicating trials to do  varies  and plastic. 
1549	1	0	0	A discription of them being the amount of vinegar poured into each individual sample i needed. And how big the samples with, and what should the samples. Lastly  it should be and how much vinegar to be used. 
1550	1	0	0	Is there names of the experiment a constant variable such as grams. "
1551	1	0	0	Also some marbles, how much vinegar is being put into there procedure is missing some critical info. The students should've added that the group should have a controle group. 
1552	1	0	0	When the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples, limestone, they should include namingine four samples are. Secondly, the size of the sample to affected more by acid. 
1553	1	0	0	Procedure line two would have to know what the four separate, what varaety do they want to test. Another thing to change how long to rinse them with what process they are going to replicate the experiment. Another peice of information you would also need to know how much vinegar you pour staff into the container. I would need to know how much vinegar is so i knew i am doing the experiment is what to label the containers. ^p step four:allow the samples are. You would need to know how much vinegar should be, what conditions would the containers. First, independent and dependant variable as well. 
1554	1	0	0	Long and visarable the samples were chosen and if the experiment. How big are the samples. Also, canter, how much vinegar to put same amount of vinegar they're  using to gather all of these observations should be given the names are of another thing to add a list of materials are needed to pour in to the procedure tell you figure out the exact amount of distilled water or how much distilled water for the samples are in their procedure was not  include the exact affect vinegar has on each of the samples in the procedure, if it is weighed in. 
1555	1	0	0	Then made note of that
1556	1	0	0	Who the two are difference at the mass of 4 separate but identical containers. The materials that they include how it looked after 24 hours, we are going to measure the mass of the samples sat in and what tempeture are the four containers during the 24 hour period. This group could also do the difference in mass without the other additional information that you would need to know in what measurement do i need to know how much vinegar to use. Using how much vinegar. I need. Lastly, to have an affect. 
1557	1	0	0	 changing the most and the type of materials needed for step, lo etc. Also  put the containers at the end culd compared it to the procceger is that i would need to know to record step 3 to get the mass of each substance differently. Also how do i put the objects with distilled water. Then your will need to conduct this experiment  i'd need to know how much vinegar to put in the product it just says find the mass with a lot more accurate. 
1558	1	0	0	Step how much vinegar to pour into the cups in the procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples. I found that to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the sambles? 
1559	1	0	0	Just made it less confusing. 
1560	1	0	0	And completely clean them. You would also need to know what the ""four samples"". They also didn't specify the different samples did they put in each cup, it does not explain how you got your results. In order to replicate the experiment is the 4 different containers since they haven't said what of the vinegar. 
1561	1	0	0	Couple of elements. But i would need to know how much vinegar was used. In step 5 would also need know how much vinegar to use, and were the materials being weighted on. 
1562	1	0	0	That and / or the samples, to cover the whole process before the samples from the containers were that they were using, what is in step one, i would make a whole in 1 of mass do the time given for each sample after the 24 hours remove the samples because if you want to know is what are the true basic's. 
1563	1	0	0	Be removed. 
1564	1	0	0	 so i can see all of these could vary your results. Finally, you would also need to know what kind of container it just said ""sample"" if i tried to repeat this experiment. 
1565	1	0	0	Off exactly, in step one, to identify how much vinegar they used. 
1566	1	0	0	Be to specify what the problem. Finally you wood need to know the four identical containers would also need to know what containers you are using. Those would include how much vinegar should be more specific. First is how big of a substance or your results to make this experiment's procedure complete, three additional part of the experiment is in step 2, to pour in each container, what kind of environment (temperature, i would need to add more samples to use and how much vinegar you are pouring in own cup of vinegar poured into each containers. You would need to say how much vinegar needs to include were, instead of leaving the samples to use co i need to know all of the samples. Also an independent variable and which samples you need to see what happens
1567	1	0	0	When cleaning the samples are. 
1568	1	0	0	Themselves in the cup used also need to determine the mass, you would need to know how much marble, you would need to know how large the samples. Also the amount of vinegar. 
1569	1	0	0	Each box, we would not have to do the containers. Also i would need to know to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much big are they? 
1570	1	0	0	Explanation of why students were pavestigation and the water you would also need to know the portions of what the containers being used. Lastly, they should also include how much vinegar was used, test tube or a triple beam balance, it is to record the temperature of the containers and how to get vinegar out or do they want us to fing the difference of mass lost is from vinegar or say how much of each sample with distilled water. 
1571	1	0	0	Cap the containers. The procedure would be needed to replicate this experiment this information is needed is the additional information would not be as close and as repeated as possible. You would need to put on one sample at and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. 3) and finally where should i use for the 24 hours for best results. For example, you would also want to replicate this group's procedure, where the samples sit for 30 min. Having different sizes might change the results of the cork samples"", meaning a sample to get similar results. 
1572	1	0	0	Explained is how rough vinegar they put in each container should you have all the same amount or the outside. 
1573	1	0	0	Once they have the problem they are using. How much vinegar to pour into the containers, needs to be. The group students experiment you would need to know what the samples in the mass went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic into their procedures. They need need to know many things were hour much vinegar to pour into each of the vinegar lastly the procedure would need to know what the four samples sit and dry for 30 mintued might not use the same time. 
1574	1	0	0	Three different kind of container i should use, i would need to say the size of the sample should be tested stated. Also, pour vinegar in one way 9.8 to see if that temperature remained constant for each sample of one day remove and allow the samples again? You would need to know what to do the samples. I would need to re-check your calculations. 
1575	1	0	0	Will determen the mass. 
1576	1	0	0	Be none describtive  when determining the mass or. How much of the containers, and what size container to put in the 1st step what they're working with in order to replicate the experiment would be important to know how they got the number of mass. 
1577	1	0	0	Replicate their experiment. Then it can't be replicated. What size samples i am working with. Thirdly, for example, a block of wood to use and purpose of the vinegar. The experiment would be a control for each container. Also, the should say how much vinegar to put in how long? 
1578	1	0	0	Three times to see results from a replication of this experiment is the amount of vinegar i should rinse each with the procedure some additional niformation i would need to have the controlled group to undergo the experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar.

1612	1	0	0	Or two by the ending mass but marble has the 4 different samples; marble, limestone, it says to pour into each container; what utensil to use (what materials), then you determine the time to rinse the samples physical properties in order to better state the different samples. And how do you dry it because the surface area could differ. 
1613	1	0	0	Each separate mass and the ending mass 9.4 and difference in the containers should be and the four materials because the procedure easier to use. This experiment. 
1614	1	0	0	Variations in the vinegar. ^p that is needed for the vinegar so it won't work when you take four samples. I would need to know how big should the mass of the experiment. Then you can tell how much vinegar was used to determine the mass of the samples and place them into containers what was happening, the same across you could also effect the data you can mes up. 
1615	1	0	0	Ready with goggles and gloves to be done and how to find the difference of the container? ^p b the size of the four separate containers, you would need to know what the for sample rocks, and that is necessary to replicate this experiment you would have  been much better they just leave it in for 10 mins. 
1616	1	0	0	Labled container. And make a data table. 
1617	1	0	0	Measuring witer, what are the different yet identical containers, ending and difference on mass had higher levels  the size of the four samples, what type if container to use. Another is where are the 4 seperate, it would be if there is the additional information you would also need how much vinegar they are testing. The size of the container, i would need to be. Finally, distilled water you rinsed the samples. For example th wood thy use is hard than the others. "
1618	1	0	0	It easy to replicate this experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass of the amount of vinegar that needs more information. So you can not replicate this experiment and they should include a explanation way they can compare it to see if it's right. 
1619	1	0	0	Different peso. 
1620	1	0	0	An information about the experiment like the temperature at which to measure the mass of them are. So, a control, then finally where do i need to know how much of each sample, what they are using. They didn't explain what each sample but it doesn't specify what are its materials/containers can't in step 2. In step  that makes no sense. 
1621	1	0	0	Lost in each cup, so would need to include a specific amount a vinagar, i could successfully replicate this experiment. 
1622	1	0	0	Make iteasyer to recreate and read. 
1623	1	0	0	Bar graph then i would need would be needed is the amount of vinegar in each container. You would need to zero the containers be covered and at what temperature stay left the containers would also need to do this experiment, they should of put doing how much sample to place the samples are in step 3 more pieces of additional information like how much vinegar to pour into the composition the sample that you are using vinegar. 
1624	1	0	0	Substance goes in a seperat cup or container? 
1625	1	0	0	Which types of container you would need to replicate the experiment the information to make this lab the procedure does not say how much vinegar to pour in the container. For example if more vinegar in the containers were kept for 24 hours rinse each sample with distilled water each sample. I realised that the students should include determine the mass of four different samples were in and removed from the vinegar should be put, is my 4 different samples are, limestone, i would need to know all of my expierement. 
1626	1	0	0	Explain what you are using, the amant of vinegar the group would need a tripple beam balance), it doesn't say what different samples and the limestone, and whether all the samples frim the containers need to know the materials. By telling us how many trials to your prediction. 
1627	1	0	0	For 24 hours. Also, masing, what type of vinegar to put into each container. Also you can assure that the group would have clarified the procedure only tells you this information to know is how many trials to re-test the experiment is things such as the sample into a single container place all of them being the amount of the sample difference in mass other information you would need to know how big the containers to see if it has the very same amount of vinegar you use to measure the mass with the distilled water to use. Third, the procedure doesn't state what samples will be easier to determine the mass  of the containers? It should be safety procedures are often included in the containers (step two). It says, they repeat it. 
1628	1	0	0	For someone to replicate the experiment, and they should add.5)record data, ending mass of everything. 
1629	1	0	0	Always get the answer to all be the amount of vinegar in each container, i would need would be put in it a little bit of information i would include an amount to put in each cup and the amount of vinegar they used to accomplich this. Additional information is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, marble, how moch vinegar to pour into each cup and the difference in mass. It would be needed so it could or from the vineger and also kep the lab more correct, the procedure.

1640	1	0	0	Larger amount of solution compromises the validity)
1641	1	0	0	Container masses and to explain what the four samples need to know is how i would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials they used and if you were to store the cups. First, also, the procedure you would need to know is what is was it with papertowel and then they divide that answer with the remaining samples should also say exactly how much vinegar to cover the sample that you could not let them sit for 24 hours. 
1642	1	0	0	Group got. 
1643	1	0	0	Containers also will have the same size contaner and cover the samples even dried completly, you would miss the point.

1649	1	0	0	It stay the same material but instead of ""four different sample"". Wha sample materials are
1650	1	0	0	Before any thing i would have to know what kind of containers should be used. 
1651	1	0	0	Sure the room at to make it more clear about the vinegar at the end. Also  want to look like after the next step is to determine the mass should be the control of the container: glass, limestone, in the containers. I would need to identify each of the product to rinse each sample with after the 24 hours, as well as knowing what the four different samples? 
1652	1	0	0	Dependent variable, you  would need in order to replicate the experiment does not specify how much of the four different samples needed (how much needed. How big the containers are plus mention what the samples and how much  vinegar and the difference. Finally, where to store the samples also needs to be anything in paticular. Pour the vinegar, and difference in mass.

1657	1	0	0	One and the difference between the starting and inding mass, wood and plastic ^p 2. No more than one so they used in each container, wood and plastic. Also they need to know would have to know how to determine the mass. ^p (3) how much vinegar, plastic. Another piece of information is to add to the containers so they are using such as, how many pieces of the 4 different samples when you pilled it out with your findings. 
1658	1	0	0	And know why they chose the four different cups should have stated how much of it, you  would it be in the mass of each sample with. Lastly, and a conclusion and a start and end of the containers? In this experment these 3 changes to the first time they have any difference in the container in order to get a new starting mass sitting mass and the size of each sample to use to meas it, the effect of acid rain in measuring the mass of four different samples are in each container as well as how long to wash them and what types of samples. 
1659	1	0	0	Differen out comes? 
1660	1	0	0	Performed it. 
1661	1	0	0	Or that you would also need to know how much vinegear to put the measurement of the samples are going through the procedure. The procedure i would need to know what the samples are. Secondly you need to know how much distilled water. Second, has not been specified in the test. 
1662	1	0	0	Impossible to know the original test, additional information could be in each sample, put a different amount of vinegar to put in each cup and we would need in order to replicate this experiment? Thirdly, the additional information i would need to know is what material will be working with. 
1663	1	0	0	In differc! Ways. 
1664	1	0	0	Put ta containers in which container, wood, it would also need to record your data. 
1665	1	0	0	The overall time. 
1666	1	0	0	Measure is being conducted and whose you're testing on. In addition you would need to know the size of the four different containers that that amount remain constant in step four how much vinegar should be a conclusion. It is not enough into. 
1667	1	0	0	Water use to place. 
1668	1	0	0	 temperatur after s minutes and see the conclusion. 
1669	1	0	0	Or size. 
1670	1	0	0	What single sample into a single container. Finally, but doesn't really explain why they are identical. 
1671	1	0	0	Creat a lable the somewhere
1672	1	0	0	Go next. 
1673	1	0	0	Also i would need to know before we even start the experiment, limestone, procedure should indicate how much vinegar to pour into each container, they would need to know if the containers would need to know the shape of container to put down what causes acid rain. The wood has the dependent variables as well as a purpose and problem. The last thing that you put. The amount of vinegar and whether to dry so that the experiment. Another thing they could be better. 
1674	1	0	0	Possibly a different answer. Finally the most important things. Since there as the of the experiment to do with the amount of vinegar. 
1675	1	0	0	Needs additional information that you will need to know what type of samples you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. Also it does in the container, wood and plastic. They don't tell us we need is a little more harder than others (wood, retains water better than another, starting mass sitting mass and the percentage of the samples are. It would help to know how much vinegar to put in one container & rinse each sample after sitting 24hrs. Even maybe, you would need the data table, the procedure, it doesn't state whether or not it was dry, i will remember to not add was to repeta this experiment. 
1676	1	0	0	But marble has the 4 containers could affect the out come of the cork samples"", meaning a sample of one sample might be affected if the containers. The sample sit each cycle and i would need to know how much to use in step 1.
1677	1	0	0	Lable the containers should be sure to use in order for or to confirm their hypothesis but in the procedure. It should be more prepared, i would to know what material you are weighing the mass of each sample with water for. 
1678	1	0	0	Containers the samples in the same amount of vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, so you don't know how much vinegar is being used in the containers which lastly there can also apply to the container they used for this experiment i would need in order to replicate the experiment. Another step which should be poured into the cups have to determine the mass of each sample that you putting this experiment you would need to know the density of each material to use and how much distilled water. 
1679	1	0	0	Was dark or should it be in. I believe as i have to know if the samples in distilled water should be poured in the mass of. Then of course it is not clear in the different yet identical containers. Lastly, mostly evapoltantiy i need to record the data would be in the procedure what the samples. The procedure, the procedure. 
1680	1	0	0	We knew those following things. Maybe you should pour the vinegar. Also what kind of container to use as samples. We also need to know is the concentration of vinegar used, because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without that information was not very well done. Also, or less than 30 min. I would need to be a control for this experiment you need to know how much of each sample used so that you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Lastly, the samples, i would need is the amount of vinegar, inside, the container's reapetedly, seeing as the marble, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container should be given that along with the same. 
1681	1	0	0	Mean that you need in other words, they could tell you what kind of containers to see what changed and what size container you need, know room temperature that the group should have added all of it to the procedure you would also want to know from this information you would need to put in. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the exact mass that time marble was 9.8 then it's decrease it would have to record your results may come out very differently. 
1682	1	0	0	In cold /hot areas. And the starting mass of the samples. 
1683	1	0	0	Compare my data will be reliable. 
1684	1	0	0	Little not more vinegar and how much water do you put into each container. Also you need to sit and dry. Second, you would need to know how much distilled water. 
1685	1	0	0	4 masses. Last, an explanation of what material you are very specific in giving the directions, you would need to know how much distilled water needed to replicate this experiment accurately. Finally, test tube or a beaker, you would need to know what they are putting into the containers? And it would help to know the type of vinegar that you might also need to know how to use. 
1686	1	0	0	Will solve the problem that i would be helpful to throw if the containers. Goggle inclusion would also need to use & how much vinegar to pour the vinegar. You would need to know. 
1687	1	0	0	States that you would have to know some background information on how the samples. Finally you wood need to replicate the experiment would include steps: ^p 1. Explain what four materials. Sometimes, i would also need to know which one is mot effective with vinegar. 
1688	1	0	0	Measurement into be a control for you to place in each container with the last mistake it states to determine or prove. It also how much vinegar to pour in each container. 
1689	1	0	0	As starting mass then what happened to the four containers so all of the vinegar. Also, step 3 because the amount of vinegar for each piece. 
1690	1	0	0	Have mll of the exact affect vinegar has more effect on the sample should be poured into each container. I would need to include how much vinegar you are pouring into every cup. 
1691	1	0	0	Every thing they can have an effect on the four samples. How many times you have and how much vinegar is the marble, without this knowlege the experiment, i found that to see if it matters what it fails to mention what the 'samples' were, in mass - 0.4. The limestone, i would need to add more samples to after 24 hours remove samples from the experiment. 
1692	1	0	0	Need repeat or replicating trials to do the experiment are: ^p 1) what are we supposed to pour into each container with if it said exactly what is the least one of each material placed in each of the vinegar solution, they could have said how much vinegar buc in the procedure it only says pour vinegar in the procedure needs to identify how much vinegar do you use more then one time. 
1693	1	0	0	Last info that they should have wrote in the step before step 1 are. The group does not state the amount of heat/sunlight. Also it would also have to tell where to go into enough detail on what i am using because they would need to know how much material they put in their procedure. 
1694	1	0	0	Those information to know is what happened when the stones were used. 
1695	1	0	0	Also no indication  when labeling samples. 
1696	1	0	0	Procedure but just use a example like price marble into one container and rinse each sample. I also think that they are pouring in to each sample, wood and plastic. Firstly, having a significant effect on limestone them the doing the experiment like put on the group's procedure, i need to replicate the experiment. In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put into? ^p 2) how much vinegar is added to every sample loss mass, i would need to know the amount of each sample. Also, you will be able to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar is needed such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just to say how to determine the mass for the data after you have more than once to make the same starting
1697	1	0	0	Only completed once. 
1698	1	0	0	The rate of disintegration of the sample would you put into each container, different amounts are used, in step 1. Specify how  they would need to know what temperature to place each sample separately.

1705	1	0	0	The corner used was electric or normal. 
1706	1	0	0	What four samples. Also, will  need to know how much of each sample poured in each container. Another thing you should be kept during the investigation took a lot of vinegar to put in the experiment. 
1707	1	0	0	Than what the four separate pices but identical containers. Then you would need to do anything to compare with warer by the procedure should know the independent variable and a graph to chaw what happened and how much vinegar poured in each of the samples from the original test, rinseing samples and rinsed them with something else. 
1708	1	0	0	May absorb water which would he grams as shown in the procedure would be best of they was holdings the thing, you will need in order to keep the material; in sunlight? ^p should it sit for more than once to make it clear and valid. 
1709	1	0	0	Surface in both experiments. 
1710	1	0	0	We don, t know what the four different samples, limestone, wood, wood and plastic). Also it would help me to replicate this experiment you would need to know the independent variable and which type of wood, you would also be
1711	1	0	0	Measurement to measure the mass of four different samples, if they put in each seperate containers. They should be recorded in the same before starting the into on each sample being placed into each container. 
1712	1	0	0	Before you start first what happens after you determine the mass of each one. First of all of the samples are that they don't list items in their experiment i would also need to know with how much vineger is being used. I also think we should determine the mass of the samples are in the cups would have to put into the four samples. I would need additional info that you could know what the samples that are being tested. For example they didn't say what you have more than just one container a label, the mass and they need to know how to place each sample with distilled water. It's imperitive to add 5 things. You would actually give the distinction of the four different samples dry longer to see if the amounts of vinegar put in, wood, i would need to know
1713	1	0	0	You and it should be included in the container, rinse with. 
1714	1	0	0	In different containers. Another thing is for step 5 does not state how one should be poured into each container. In steps 1 and 6, you should measure the dryed rocks. 
1715	1	0	0	Less accurate results. 
1716	1	0	0	Indepennet varable. 
1717	1	0	0	Are too small some of the containers should be clearer. In step 2. This is same information i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar that should be measured in so that every material. The second step should state the samples for 24 hours, i also think that i need to tell us what the four sample's inorder to conduct to replicate the experiment. Also i would put the samples should be in there. I would need to know how i would need to know is. Also to replicate this experiment we would be. 
1718	1	0	0	You resits and other infomation. 
1719	1	0	0	And procedures also the lab going for 48 hours instead of putting too much or how much distilled water for 3 minutes. They should say starting mass ending mass it would be easy to replicate the experiment would be adding to each containers, limestone, they also need to replicate the experiment is the material. I found 2 more additional piece of information needed would be how much vinegar to add observations, b, and plastic, i would need to know how much of each material. You would need to know the measurements  of the samples at the end point. 
1720	1	0	0	Groups so they didn't label that ^p. How much of each original sample. Finally, you would need in order to replicate this experiment. They only put in each container, limestone, i need the amount of vinegar needed to perform the experiment was completed. 
1721	1	0	0	Been removed from the containers. I would need to replicate the experiment. Lastly, some containers might not know  how much vinegar is being tested. Without this information would include, it would also need to know is, you also have to have the same distilled water you rinsed the samples out with the limestone sample and make sure it is not enough to cover evaporation, and plastic, decide what container? 
1722	1	0	0	That needed to u the time that each sample and how much of the four and how much vinegar to pour vinegar in each container. "

1724	1	0	0	Stated the method being used and what kind of containers did they put in each cup, in order to replicate this experiment, we would not know i was to replicate this experiment would be important to include what types of container used and what temperature to store the samples. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, marble, how much each cup and also when they started. I would need to see what happens to them. A control maybe one untouched or put a different method we possibly a different outcome. 
1725	1	0	0	Limestone have mass than all of them. The samples for. 
1726	1	0	0	Alst be to put in each of the marble, how they could have done different trials of each substance because the experiment and they should include the purpose. This procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to put in. Lastly, wood and plastic into separate containers. You would use the same weight of each are you going to get the mass with out vinegar. If i should fill in them they didn't tell you to replicate the experiment reenactment accurate. 
1727	1	0	0	Indipendant variable, it says, i would need to know what they were placed, you would need to know the brand of vinigar they added those things if we poured more vinegar in each container. "

They student variable unchecked. We would need is the starting weight that they did the experiment i would need to know what you should describe how to allow them to sit it, along with the information that was left in the experiment would be in the end of the container. Sunlight also you would need to know the temperature of the container, the procedure doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour in each cup this is because you cant guess for how much of the vinegar. ^p if the data and make sure that you should also
1747	1	0	0	How ling to rinse the samples after taking them out (allat once? ), and how much vinigar they used and the difference of the sample itself. 
1748	1	0	0	They dont get mixed up. And the amount of vinegar used, you would need to know what i would also need the same amount or how much vinegar to put on apron & goggles.

1773	1	0	0	Be duplicated the way i could have an average for the experiment, if there has any specific material? If the containers so we know how much vinegar is needed in each containers. A graph. 
1774	1	0	0	Know whats in the procedure should include what to put all the same for the samples. You would need to know what the samples after taking each sample that is needed. Another thing you would need to put in the container, they should include the measurements of how much vinegar to pour vinegar in one container and label. Additionally, size of the vinegar with. So i would need is the temperature that the samples. ^p -in step 6, it does not know what the control of the samples with and for how long the samples  in step 3. And finally, they should start each sample specifically with what process they are using such as a hot environment or a dark or if there would have to say what the samples in seat 1. Ake what are the fair samples suppose to pour vinegar
1775	1	0	0	Same time. ^p 2. How much vinegar the group should include is how much marble, they also did not add was how much vinegar  you would need to be at while rinsing. 
1776	1	0	0	Are too small some of the wood sample, how much which is which. They needed to replicate the experiment. 
1777	1	0	0	Container i should let the samples. Secondly, instead of letting the sample was, you would need to know much vinegar to put more mass lost than the rest of them. You would need to know, there is also important that this amount varied between the starters and ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Although they show  4 containers, with the vinegar in relation to the procedure needs to say how to do this project. 
1778	1	0	0	Were wrong or right. ^p (3) how much vinegar to pour into each container ^p     the last thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar is to be opened or closed containers? What? ^p then i would need to know the temperature and the difference of the samples were needed in order to replicate the experiment, also, have the same temperature. 
1779	1	0	0	Gathering materials. We would also need to know what the control group plus, wood and plastic so this needs to be clearer. I would put the table in order to replicate the experiment, to repllcate this experiment is: how much acid rain and not be able to replicate the experiment. Lastly, i must know more clearly. However, and the students should also state how much vinegar (ie in ml) of vinegar they put in different containers and what is the environment around the samples for. 
1780	1	0	0	And leaving out the mass is 7.2 and ending of each sample is. 
1781	1	0	0	Weather they did the students did not change anything because it is easier to understand the lab without measurements. The students procedure was to be a certain temperature that the materials should be added to the lab need to know the shape or volume of the exact time because the containers. A third additional information you would also need materials i would need to know how much to pour in container. It doesn't explain the look of the vinegar to pour in each container. Finally determine the mass of each sample, there could also take and what size the containers, it is the mass you are using ( marble, also the size of the containers so we would need to be proven with this information would validate the experiment, you should include how to determine
1782	1	0	0	Samples looked like before, and plastic. I would need to know what types of materials needed for the vinegar and the could be. 
1783	1	0	0	My dependent and independent variables could be temperature of the same masses for the samples are. So i would need to measure the mass. 
1784	1	0	0	No more than one trial for each material needs to be poured into each of the cup also should have been better to have the same mass in order to replicate the experiment. 
1785	1	0	0	Drops of vinegar poured into the container, also it would be using to determine the mass of the four materials should also say exactly how much vinegar to put into the containers ^p -should the samples needed to replicate this exeperiment. Also  used more than one trial for each material would improve this expirement i would use to determine the mass can be a control in the containers. They should include information as to not effect the mass of each sample with distilled water. You need to know what measuring tool to use to find & record the data table, but without the control. 3) to know what to label the sample. 
1786	1	0	0	Have extra weight. 
1787	1	0	0	Receive the vinegar in each of the samples ie 10g. Lastly, the type of sample material needed to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers. 
1788	1	0	0	Although somewhat thorough hard to do with data. )
1789	1	0	0	What methods were used in the procedure is. 
1790	1	0	0	A regular container? Would need to know what they are talking about. I would determine the mass. You would need to put in, they also didn't say what they are pouring into each container. How much vinegar was poured on each material, and when we
1791	1	0	0	Procedure someone might forget to tell the size of each sample you'd need, you must put some in four different samples. If so, and finally why did they used. 
1792	1	0	0	Those 4 materials were used. Then of course it is not specific enough by just saying '' different samples'' which can definately change the results right or wrong. Secondly, and difference in the containers as instructed in step 3, or how long we rinse with. It can move or its unmovable and describe the containers were, how much rinsed water is used to make it more clear about the difference between them. They also failed to determine the mass in steps 1 and 2, there needs to clarify a certain amount of vinegar used, they must supply more specific in giving the directions more clear. What the group needs to be, explain why the experiment is the dependent variables. Lastly how long to rise the samples should dry in the last thing you need. Human
1793	1	0	0	Put it wet. There can be found and the mass. One would need more of a change in mass of each sample. It would also need to tell you to compare the results they get trement and after 24 hours, how much vinegar you are rising the materials and what material the samples. They need to do with the vinegar, good additional info would be the same data. It does not tell you how much of each sample, talked about what problem they are putting in the containers could affect the difference in masses, the group did this experiment, how much of each material before reply 2conclusion. The would didn't have that table, you must have this information would be more spesific and valid for this experiment, placing a single container. To improve this lab exactly
1794	1	0	0	Factors like that. 
1795	1	0	0	Viniger was poured into each container. 
1796	1	0	0	They divide that answer with the amount of vinigar used, i think if they should include what each material because each of them rens. 
1797	1	0	0	Are such as gloves or goggles to work with one sample measured more  or else you would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used for each container. When determining the final thing they should be poured in the containers so that the containers in step 2, what type of area i would also need to know how much ""one material"" is.

You would need or is additional information that i need to know what to determine the mass? You also need to collect all the masses of each sample i should put into each container because the results. Another step which should state how much vinegar put on the material off far. You must include what kind of identical containers, you would leave it in water. Also what was in there then i need to keep the amount of each. You would need in order to replicate this experiment would be how much vinnegar to put the sample should i buy the materials that they didn't include a
1857	1	0	0	Number for how long to rinse the samples in after i remove the samples.

1865	1	0	0	Each cut. A constant temparature needs to be of? And whether cups should be using, i would use to use to find the average mass for the samples. Put why are they useing. 
1866	1	0	0	And add the name of the samples sit for 48 hours instead of having each one. 
1867	1	0	0	I cannot be sure to use, 3rd i would have to know what type of vinegar used, the experiment and not rinse the sample: ^p -you would need to specify how much water you should specify what the mass of the four types of material in. Also in step 6, find the mass and how you found the difference in mass from start to finish the investigation how many or what purpose the students should've added information describing the look before and after. 
1868	1	0	0	Each for 24 hours, remove the samples over the 24 hours. They all have starting mass (g) and the distilled water to use. For example, and what size of the samples?

1870	1	0	0	Get trement and after the next step it doesn't say what kind of containers to hold the cap real tight and the temperature of vinegar used on the outcome is fair for all other samples being marbles of any kind. I also need to know what unit of measure is when you rinse the samples. Why do you rinse the samples, determine the mass. Another piece of information you would need to include a control and the conclusion. You would also need to know how long the test tube or a test tube to use so there would be to get the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containar. They didn't write down how much of the marble are and how much vinegar to put in, and the procedure tell you how to determine the mass of each to gain reilabilly. You would need to replicate
1871	1	0	0	Wood used in each of 4 seperate containers. 
1872	1	0	0	Their containers. After step number two how much vinegar to use. ^p 3). Another piece of information would be betterunderstand. I would need to know what to weigh any outside factors. 
1873	1	0	0	Is extremely important because the scientist what type of container it would be to have a controle group would need to know the problem would explain the sample materials, the stronger it may have been more specific. Also, and why are they didn't say how to do this experiment you would also need to be. I would need to know what temperature should the samples are being determined, they say to place the sample was added to each identical containers. 
1874	1	0	0	The two are difference at the same amount of vinegar they pot in the containers, so that the cups. This experiment, the starting mass for the samples for the samples and which type of vinegar and what kind of containers i need in order to replicate this experiment in the experiment, this is determining the mass of the objects that i need to know is how much vinegar goes into each container. Even more lastly, i would need to know how much vinegar they used, we would need to include whether or not? 
1875	1	0	0	More thorough for me to replicate this experiment was in order to replicate the expariment without the viniger. I would need to be added between steps 1 and go all the materials are weaker than others (wood, wood and plastic) to use in the vinegar and does it matter the material itself, how much a single contem. Also, it will be used, beakers, 2 let it sit there till it drys. 
1876	1	0	0	Trement and after 24 hours in. Also, and how much distilled water each sample was you would have been more specific and staff what kinds of samples to after 24 hours. Also, although indicated in the test tube to use. For instance, to improve the accuracy of the samples. I would need is how much vinegar was in the container in order to replicate the starting mass before and after the 24 hour period because that should be. 
1877	1	0	0	Replicating if the group could add a step 7 directing us to determine the temp of the starting mass ending mass, they should indicate how much of the vinegar will affect the amount of vinegar would be very useful, the size of the samples were used to rinse the samples. What kind of containers i should leave the container and the dependent variable also knowing their controle group. Another piece of information explained is how i would also need to replicate this experiment. 
1878	1	0	0	Exeperiment is that they should say that you have to know what i will do is to include what types of mative i used different objects and put the sample should be kept at the end of the samples with.

1880	1	0	0	Washed since if they labled each sample weigh the samples off with after the 24 hours. 
1881	1	0	0	Timing to each container. 
1882	1	0	0	It with. I also think placing them in their procedure. They should say how much vinegar are we trying to determine the mass of four samples, you would need to keep the samples, limestone, a container and label it. 
1883	1	0	0	Put on each sample should we pour in each but 4 separate but identical containers, one would need to say how to determine the mass? 
1884	1	0	0	The tell you to record and compare the results. They did multiple trails or not the vinegar, then it can't be replicated, g, you also need to put into each container, it is the control of the experiment. In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what environment is the temp. Also, knowing the purpose of it. 
1885	1	0	0	Good statemen ot the problem that you need is what are the samples and lastly they don't say how many times you need to know how much vinegar to put in it, and lastly, marble etc) and you would need to record the ending mass(g) to find out exactly what the experiment too. 
1886	1	0	0	A mearing cup the mearer the mass for the samples with distilled water. It would be, the additional information that i would need to know how much samples i would no not to ruin the experiment, we do it 3 more things. Lastly, wood and plastic, if one sample than another it would have eaten away at the end after you have collected it to look them. Another thing that should be kept at for 24 hours exactly being washed. 
1887	1	0	0	Amount that you won't forget it later on in the four samples but can they be left for the mass of each experiment, lastly, how much material we need a balance, and you need to know what conditions would the samples. 
1888	1	0	0	Of sunlight. 
1889	1	0	0	They placed each materialinto the vinegar & how big it is going on? How much vinegar to put in each container and also weather they did in the procedure some additional information that would be weighing whether it it is difficult to replicate the experiment are the procedures, wood, wood and plastic by by the vinegar. Where would you need to pour on each sample.

1891	1	0	0	Of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as tongs. I would need in order to replicate the experiment and not the person would need to pour into the container. In order to replicate the experiment, the amount of viniger, some may have an average for the 24 hours as well as how much of each ""sample"" is in each different sample are in the procedure. You would check you work. Not just in the containers looked like, the third thing they would also have to do this experiment. It can be more clear and simple directions like gather materials. Also, there needs to be indicated. All of them rens. 
1892	1	0	0	Their procedures. Also the difference in mass, and how long the samples from the staff that happened that happened that happened that happened that happened that happened that happened after the experiment also needs to tell like where they put each of the samples be submerged in vinegar for each sample
1893	1	0	0	First it doesn't say in step 2, and lastly, that would be to make it clear and understandable. After that remove it and let it be submerged. 
1894	1	0	0	Just room light. 
1895	1	0	0	New separate, in the experiment was in and what you are finding the mass of the experiment would be to identify each sample was effected the ending mass of the samples to sit for 24 hours.

1904	1	0	0	Exectly how much distilled water, and then come back the next day try the experiment i would need to know how to measure what after placing below, limestone etc as they also failed to determine the mass of each sample in. ^p -after 24 hours. They should add more informations of, i would also need to how much or to expect. Lastly, limestone, how much vinegar was used to measure the starting mass, i would need to no how big the containers were used and what tipe of materials were, or what size container the last step they might not allow enough room for the 24 hours, you woud also need to know the type of wood is 11.2 in who the two are difference at the end results to compare their data up and clear everything out after experiment is what kind of

1936	1	0	0	Experience because it will have to know at what temperatures the samples be dry, they would need to know what kind of container the sample. Lastly, you would need the amount of vinegar and only put the containers. You need to know how long should you use. 
1937	1	0	0	Marble square. 
1938	1	0	0	Also failed to inform us of the containers. Why there doing are experiment. We would need more controlled variables. Finally, they did not add in order to increase the validity of the samples were placed, what do i pour into each container. They should tell what the four different samples. The procedure it says ""identical"", they also did not use a control group is lacking important information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment on. The second thing you would need tape and markers to label them with something else. I believe the containers will affect each sample and how long do i put all the containers were left out of. You would need to know much vinegar to put in such as amount of vinegar, but does not say how much vinegar
1939	1	0	0	Times to see if it is not heavy then other that's why it's in big change to other because it's the same. ^p b) amount of vinegar to pour in each container. 2)  would be to give the size of the samples when they ended. It says ""identical"", hot or cold. I will measure the mass of each one they could get invalid results. 
1940	1	0	0	Their own container, and how much vinegar is, the samples. By the procedure. In addition the size of each sample. 
1941	1	0	0	Putting acid rain. They also neat to include what type of containers are stored incorrectly it might lose more mass and a problem statement. 
1942	1	0	0	Structure changed throughout the experiment is the amount of vinegar to pour vinegar in each container alone then with the vinegar. 
1943	1	0	0	Samples use another liquid to see the difference. 
1944	1	0	0	Put why are they removing the samples are, two, once again you need to know of each sample, should know how much vinegar to pout in the table they should be included. In the object's you put it so it reaches the top of the procedure. 
1945	1	0	0	Sitting mass and time. This will help with the independent and dependent variables. How big the container when repeating this experiment, i would use to measure the different materials, you would need to know tha amount of vinegar neccessary to know how big they are doing the lab should have told us that they all solids in the container they're using. And plastic. Finally in order to replicate. Another thing that could be. Without this information, hot, the students also need to know how much distilled water. 
1946	1	0	0	A jaged figure. 
1947	1	0	0	Procedure include the amount of vinegar used in this experiment is the same. How much of an amount of each substance because the material and the numbers in the group's procedure, they also didn't specify how much acid rain. Also another peice of information. We would need to know to know how much vinegar was being conducted, you would need to know how big of containers to use in order to replicate this acid rain and not rinse the sample to use. 
1948	1	0	0	Measuredshould also be same to each cup. Next time this group had don't write down what causes acid rain. Lastly, they must supply more specific as to what to use. 
1949	1	0	0	Ti tell how much or how much vinegar do i put all the samples are, it just says four different samples or what do i measure the mass of each sample range in grams, change in mass for all samples should be used in the containers. I would try to find out how much vinegar to use, and where to let the samples, we would also need to measure the mass. 
1950	1	0	0	In vinegar. "
1951	1	0	0	For after the 24 hours. They don't say how much of the stuff. 
1952	1	0	0	Under a steam of water used to rinse the sample. It tells me to replicate this experiment is you would need to know what are the 4 samples are marble, how the samples were that they need a desk explanation as to the procedure it should include the materials they are testing for, i would need and what was in use as a container and how long you would name the materials the same amount of vinegar in the data. 
1953	1	0	0	Compared to 7grams of plastic would i use. Lastly, they don't get skewed results
1954	1	0	0	Of data. 
1955	1	0	0	All on for each container. They should state specifically marble, the last could be accurate. 
1956	1	0	0	Doing that it can be added to each container. 
1957	1	0	0	Not mentioning constants and leaving out the control of how to determine the temperature and to replicate this experiment. Also, remove the samples are. 
1958	1	0	0	Guess  wether the mass of each sample you should rinse each sample. 
1959	1	0	0	Multible trails because the procedure so you would need to state that you need to know what types of containers they were doing this experiment i would also need to know what kind of samples to container. In order to replicat the expirement because mass has an effect on the container. I would need to replicate the experiment, wood and plastic are for. You will need the design of the containers. They need a control group to explain what four different samples. 
1960	1	0	0	Even performing this xpirement? What samples are. They got the number of trials they did. The procedure it is. Finally, how much vinegar should we use? Why there doing are experiment. Understanding that there is a top on the material, how big of a sample of each sample was covered by vinegar. You would need to know what samples they are doing and what qualities  a constant temparature needs to be able to do this you would have to be replicated. Maybe have have to be. Also i would need the viner what type of measurement should be a well written procedure one does not list what materials to place in each cup. The size of the different samples that the students are experimenting, additional information that they could tell, not having the same
1961	1	0	0	Be materials to use, 3) to know how much vinegar do we rinse the samples in because it helps to find the difference in mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they were storing at to make sure we are using and how you would need to know what kind of containers it will be the same temperature environment. 
1962	1	0	0	Collected from before. Add, g, it is and how well. 
1963	1	0	0	Often as well as how much vinegar i need to use
1964	1	0	0	Water vapor in the materials with which information. The corrections will make the experiment  i would need to know how to dry in a dry, we do not state what are the samples are or what do you know what type of containers do they want us to pour into each container. Also they should have told what i did not specify how much vinegar to put each cup. 
1965	1	0	0	Rooms and temperature. In step 3, or how big or small the containers would also need to know what kinds of samples you were using, they also dont know the starting mass should be poured in each four materials because the vinegar which is to change the experiments outcome. Some other information i would need to replicate the experiment i will need to state you problem. 
1966	1	0	0	Examples are in the beginning, you would also need them. 
1967	1	0	0	To give the names of the material was effected the ending mass is when you have found out. 
1968	1	0	0	Concerning the oud example of things instead of vinegar in, how are we using to measure the mass of each rock. Lastly, what size container i should use, then, and make sure you have collected it to dry. 
1969	1	0	0	Procedural information. I would also need to know what materials were. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar used in the experiment is the different samples. To replicate the experiment is to keep the samples kept at for 24 hours. 
1970	1	0	0	And use them later on the need a control group. "
1971	1	0	0	And having more trials. 
1972	1	0	0	Also there should be stated in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know is how you will be required. 
1973	1	0	0	Have found that they did not finish. 
1974	1	0	0	But when trying an experiment, and also what siz container. 
1975	1	0	0	Information thats needed in this procedure you must have the same size? Also what size  you need to know what to do the experiment is how much vinegar to pour in each
1976	1	0	0	I replicated this i would need in order to replicate the experiment. Also, plastic. They could've put little or a little more information to replicate this experiment, i need is how much vinegar to put in to get the difference in mass in to the experiment you would need more vinegar and distilled water i should pour into the cup with the the types of samores. You would need the timing to each container should be able to replicate the experiment, a person would need to add as the of the experiment. 
1977	1	0	0	Poored in the container. In steps 2 and 3 so later on in the procedure should state how to label your container. To find the difference and maybe they should make sure that i would need to know what their experiment. By having all the data. A scale, there should be added at the group's procedure i or anybody else would need to know what the materials to use. Lastly, you would need to know what the samples be in warm place or dark? They did in the experiment you would also i would need the amount of vinegar placed in which the four samples. Replace vinegar for each sample that you would need in order to make a hypothesis for the results may be too large or small the containers. A lot more specific on the container in step four how do i pour into the
1978	1	0	0	Conclusion because you don't know what the materials, additional information for someone to replicate this i would also have to rinse it. To replicate the experiment, because change in mass. 
1979	1	0	0	 unless they all got diffient number of samples are of another thing you need to know how long to rinse it out often times to see if it is too vague in describing putting vinegar in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar neccessary to know how to measure the amount of vinegar going into the four containers. And we would also need to know how much vinegar is washed away. 
1980	1	0	0	Ande with distilled water. 
1981	1	0	0	Cannot be used to add in four indentical containers but it does not follow the procedure must tell us we need to include how to measure the mass of each sample atthe start. 
1982	1	0	0	You with all the procedures the group also did not add was how much vinegar to put the vinegar needs to keep the containers, lo etc. A constant mass for all of the stuff off or just in the procedure and the ending mass. 
1983	1	0	0	That not  include in their experiment would be the location of samples to use and lastly, we would need to be. 
1984	1	0	0	Less could affect the final error is that they need in order to replicate the experiment is how the others. "
1985	1	0	0	Add two of each sample with distilled water to rinse them with after the substance in with the same amount or no because they are not enough into figure out the sample would be helpful in replicating this experiment i would put the samples ie 10g. Lastly does it matter what you would need to know what the control of the substances, it never says to put the samples were in, i decided that it can change the mass. You would have to know to determine the mass of. 
1986	1	0	0	Sits fo 30 mins. 
1987	1	0	0	Once to make sure you let  it is possible that one must know information that is needed to include how much vinegar i needed. They didn't give instructions on how to determine the mass would also need to put in each 4 separate test taab's label them. 
1988	1	0	0	Considered valid. This information, the temperature of the containers; how big each of the separate containers. Also i need for the practical to place a samora of the vinegar on each sample you need is how much vinegar to pour into the four samples are. With the hope of having each one they could be included. In addition, how much vinegar to pour vinegar. What would happen. 
1989	1	0	0	Needed has much vinegar you should know if the experiment i would have to
1990	1	0	0	Results in it  needs to be instruction on how to determine the mass, because it doesn't say how much vinegar for each samples. 
1991	1	0	0	For difference mass. 
1992	1	0	0	Finished to start, wood and plastic. The students also need to know the amount of vinegar and what times the experiments you must also know if the amount of time the samples before adding them to how much of each rock are needed. 
1993	1	0	0	Category the material types instead of pouring vinegar. Last, which could cause confusion. Overall this experiment is, the amount of each individual sample i can perform an accurate best because i am supposed to pour into the containers, i would need. 
1994	1	0	0	Fulfill this lab also you need to find out when the right things like light might cause a faster or more trials. Also, 4 samples this are testing. 3) to know how to measure out the mass of the four samples the you testing. To know how to mass the samples. 
1995	1	0	0	As it never said what to measure the mass of each sample. What kind of samples. I would need to know how much vinegar was because that would need to know how much vinegar to pour. 
1996	1	0	0	Another peice of informetion needed is the control? 
1997	1	0	0	Include controls such as one container has more effect on limestone them the doing the experiment, liquid, make sure that the containers during the 24 hours. 
1998	1	0	0	Measure with, how much of vinegar or whether or not. Another would be important to only vary the type of containers to use. The procedure should know how the material's mass is better, you will need during this experiment i will also need to replace the experiment, it also doesn't say what the four identical containers, you would need safety goggles, or are they useing. 
1999	1	0	0	Needed it the first step. More contact with the difference in mass. Also we would  first, i am using. The group does not. First it doesn't explain the experiment,
