Finally the authro explains that countries are currently working on solutions to the problem of space junk. The reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding. The author then goes on to explain what space junk is, and what occurs, if they collide into each other some time, causing big collisions.

Finall, the author gives dangers of the issue. The author begins with statements that grap the reader's attention and help them to become intrested. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them. The first one, entitled 'what is space junk? , crash course, then little bits, but a big deal. Breaking it down into things of importance. To begin, after they have the reader's attention from their introduction, they explain what the space junk does, and how it got there. It talks about the danger of microdebris in space.

The author of this article organized the paper logically. First, the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why satellites can be considered space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve the probelm, and prevent damage from space debris. 
43378	9	0	0	Thing the author talked about 'what is space junk? '.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.

'  in this section, one may be confused as to what the author is tring to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, then changes to a section devoted to specifically explain what space junk is. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This creates a 'great concern to government space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on earth in 'little bits, but a big deal. The paragraph says this when it explains the great space invasion and how high tech junk circles the globe in orbit. Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention. Next, the author also organizes the first section with 'the disabled object becomes a pieces of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'crash course' paragraph and so on. He has headings such as what is space junk? '.  Then in the third paragraph, the reader also learns some background information, further explanation of risk, and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done to try to help collect some of the space junk and how 'the human race's

The objects themselves, however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth far from elemsnts that would cause them to degrade or burn up. In this airless environment, some of them continue to circle the planet indefinitely. While this is ideal for a fully functioning object that was launched for that purpose for example, a communications satellite what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired? ' of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, crash course, etc. The did a really good job organizing the article in this way the author has made it easier for the reader t fully understand the author's veiwpoint on the matter, and also gets into better detail.

This section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk can and will do if you are not cautious about things that can be left up there. They also do this so people will not get so confused when they are reading the article. The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections. Each one of these sections are then divided into smaller paragraphs. Next the author tries to amaze the readers by describing how excessive force of small objects can cause a big problem like navigating a space craft through a microdebris field that could harm the space craft.

The last section tells you why it matters. Why they little tiny space debris or junk matter. Because it is harmful. It then moves on to describe exactly what space junk is and how it comes about. Next, we move on to what really is 'space junk'. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one russian and one american communication satellite collided into each other causing more debry in the section titled 'what is space junk?

Last, the author divides different portions of the article by using headers and titles to sort the information, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space, the author arranged his or her piece in a cause and effect type of order. An example of this is the title what is space junk, ' 'crash course, ' shows why space junk is an issue in space exploration.

First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'what is space junk', 'crash course', and 'little bits, but a big deal' exposes the risk of tiny space debris then concludes the article restating the negative effects space debris can cause. In the second section, 'what is space junk', and how it poses a threat to future space missions because bits of junk flying at intense speeds can cause harm to a spacecraft or an astronaut. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and astronauts repairing a space ship. Aslo at the end they kind of leave you with a little bit of history about space travel. Lastly, the author goes into more detail about it. Then explains how it has damaged satelites.
