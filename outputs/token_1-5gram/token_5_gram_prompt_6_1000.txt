28001	6	0	0	The three processes that a cell uses is phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is when the cell divides and now there are 2 cells. 
28002	6	0	0	And allowes acces for food for the cell. The third process cells use is called osmosis. This too, is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy. Endocytosis: in this process, a cell membrane controls what enters and exits the cell. Lastly, another way to move a substance across the membrane. It requires no energy, so it must move water and other substances across its membrane. Osmosis mainly uses water to move across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Second, cells use active transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell. Reproduction effects the cell by reproducing the part of the cell. In passive transport, which is selectively permeable in the case of some green alge. It flotes at the water surface slowly moving with the tide. The more that is connected, the more food they get because they can take in more.

Active transport- this requires energy to be used by the cell to keep unwanted organisms out of the cell. The cell wall is barrier to sources outside of the cell membrane and end up in nucleus. Two, they could move all around the world. If you
28964	6	0	0	Of passive transport include osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances across the membrane, and the proteins.

28970	6	0	0	Process controls the water flow throughout a cell membrane, but if it is a bad thing. The membrane only allows small things to pass. It can't pass through if its too big. 
28971	6	0	0	They are copied form the parents and travel across the membranes. They also use diffusion to get materials through the cell membrane
28972	6	0	0	Cells way of controlling what is allwoed through, and what is notpinocytosis - the movement of particle from greater areas of concentration into areas of lesser concentrationcell permeability - the cells way of controlling what is allwoed through, and what is notpinocytosis - the movement of particle across a cel membrane. Diffusion is used by the cell. Osmosis, and transportation. In diffusion, they difuse into the cell. The plasma membrain also controlls how cells take in food, and how we do thing to our body. 
28973	6	0	0	The endoplasmic reticulum and as a highway to move proteins out and around the cell's insides. Also the use of trucking which carries the proteins throughout the endplamic reticulum. Messenger uses the cell to give messages or instructions to the ribosomes from the nucleus. 
28974	6	0	0	Spread throughout a space. Osmosis is the movement of the organelles by keeping everything in the middle of the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum controls what proteins the cell keeps. 
28975	6	0	0	Transfer p and k ions across a membrane. Osmosis movement of water across of a cell. Vacuoles are the processes in the cell that stores things. 
28976	6	0	0	Start to break down the substance, and finale mitocondrean destro and eat the substance and use it as food. 
28977	6	0	0	Cells just help with the movement of the cell across the cell membrane. Exocytosis controls what is put out of the cell. 
28978	6	0	0	To go into the nucleus to produce energy. The last on is diffusional fusion which randomly moves items. 
28979	6	0	0	Transport proteins decide what goes in and out of the cell. Things that let things in and out       also moves a cell. Cilia          and exocytosis moves large materials out of a cell with vesiclesendocytosis is where the cell uses energy to bring subtances. 
28980	6	0	0	Active transport    osmosisdiffusion
28981	6	0	0	Up with certain substances and then lets them into the cell. Ribosomes carry out protiens. Mitchondria are the powerhouse and provide energy. Lysosomes, which come from the golgi apparatus, and lysosomes to move substances across the cell membrane by not allowing any harmful substances through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. Another one is called osmosis and that is when liquid substances are moved acorss the membrane from higher concentration to lower concentration. Facilitated diffussion: like osmosis, but it does not require energy. Cell division basically includes the other two processes. Mitosis and meiosis both are processes in which divide the cell in half or into four different cells. They move throgh it on ribosomes. 
28982	6	0	0	Let anything past the it so it don't touch the cell wall. The sugars. 
28983	6	0	0	Across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell. Transcription and translation also take place in the cell. Osmosis is the spread of water through an area. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances. 
28984	6	0	0	Unit of all living things. Cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body. They let only ions pass through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is the movement of substances across the membrade of the cell. Diffusion controls how gentic information is moved to another cell. Cells also use diffusion. Diffusion moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area. Osmosis also brings substances into the cell. 
28985	6	0	0	Of waterdiffusion the movements of particles from high concentration to lower ones. Active transport uses energy to get the particles across it safely with out harming the cell. 
28986	6	0	0	But occurs with water. Facilitated diffusion is a type of diffusions where cells have holes in them that allow things to pass through there membrane. There they are moved throughout the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells. It also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out. Certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through. The third is translation it helps create rna that can help later on to control what crosses the cell membrane. 
28987	6	0	0	Polar head has a positive charge and the non-polar head has a negative charge. This allows water to flow through the cell membrane. They determine whether the substance is harmful or not and act accordingly. 
28988	6	0	0	That cells use is diffusion. The cytoplasm allows it to enter
28989	6	0	0	One for example would be diffusion. It uses diffusion to move other things in and out of the cell. Amio acids.
