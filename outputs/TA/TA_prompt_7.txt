17182	7	2	2	Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature. When Anna gets upset about missing her Papa, instead of getting angry with Anna for not being understanding, Rose calmly explains to her that it is necessary for him to work in Los Angeles because he is making  more money there.
17186	7	2	2	Rose can see from her aunts point of view like she says in the story, she thought about wheather or not what she said about the dream if it would hurt her aunts feelings or not.  Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions.
17187	7	2	2	Rose is very caring towards her family. In the story, she doesn't want to tell her aunt that she is weighed down by all she is doing for Paul because she fells that this might discourage her mother and aunt.
17190	7	2	2	One trait the describes Rose is hard working. Even though her aunt, her sister, and her are working to pay for Paul to go to college and get his diploma she never stops working. She is always willing to see what is best for the other person in the relationship. She could just law down and say 'I quit,' but she doesn't. She keeps working towards a better future for her family and herself.
17195	7	2	2	Although Rose feels very weighed down and stressed by the weight of the family, she is very considerate of other people's feelings. She does not want to hurt her aunt or her mother's feelings by admitting the way that she feels. However, Aunt Kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece.
17200	7	2	2	'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job,Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This is a quote taken out of the passage. Rose is trying to calm Anna down she understands that  its hard for her and it is almost as if Rose has become the 'mother figure' in Annas life. So the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring. She cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer.
17209	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has shown is hopefulness.  Even though things are hard for her right now she isn't giving up on things.  In paragraph 23 of the text it states, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'  By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.
17211	7	2	2	She is hopeful. In her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have do to our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'. She is hoping and trusting that Paul will do well in college.
17220	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because in paragraph 19 it says that Rose didin't answer so she would not hurt her aunt's feelings.
17226	7	2	2	Rose is considerate of other peoples feelings.'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17236	7	2	2	Rose truly puts her family first. She is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college. Rose is only a highschool girl and she is already taking on a huge amount of resposibility for her family.
17239	7	2	2	I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
17244	7	2	2	She feels its her responsibility to help support Paul and the family, so that later in return he can finance both Rose and Annas college educations.
17245	7	2	2	Rose is caring and wants to help people. When she is having a conversation with her aunt, she tries to avoid telling her that all the work she does for this family is really hard. She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings.
17251	7	2	2	'Anna,'Rose said 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' from this part of the story i felt that she was caring.
17252	7	2	2	When Rose says that he has only been gone for four months and he is getting paid three times as much in Los Angeles. It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person, partly because she feels obligated to.
17255	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
17261	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring.
17262	7	2	2	Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.
17263	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is determination. One detail that supports Rose being determined is how even though she feels busy and overloaded, she is determined to still work hard at her job and school work to make things easier for her family.
17274	7	2	2	Roes is caring. She worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them. during her talk with Anna Roes says 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college.' showing that she wants what is best for her brother.
17282	7	2	2	'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' One trait of Rose is that she is caring.
17295	7	2	2	One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay.
17297	7	2	2	Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
17302	7	2	2	She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17304	7	2	2	Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
17312	7	2	2	She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17315	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too.
17324	7	2	2	Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
17334	7	2	2	Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
17335	7	2	2	Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
17337	7	2	2	Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself.
17338	7	2	2	Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
17342	7	2	2	She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt.
17344	7	2	2	One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17354	7	2	2	One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
17361	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17366	7	2	2	In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
17381	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17383	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father.
17384	7	2	2	Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
17385	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
17386	7	2	2	Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college.
17393	7	2	2	I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17395	7	2	2	She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out.
17397	7	2	2	She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her.
17407	7	2	2	Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17408	7	2	2	concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
17410	7	2	2	In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.
17413	7	2	2	One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
17417	7	2	2	In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will.
17420	7	2	2	The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her.
17422	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
17423	7	2	2	During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college.
17425	7	2	2	She is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17443	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college. Their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and Rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up.
17453	7	2	2	Rose is caring and trys to comfort her sister Anna, when Anna is down because her parents are never home. Rose says to Anna in the story that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away.
17454	7	2	2	Rose, to me, seems to be a very hard working person. In the story she tells us she has work most days right after school, then help with dinner, and finally do homework. By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education.
17457	7	2	2	Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family.  Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school.  She works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around.
17463	7	2	2	I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
17464	7	2	2	Caring, when she is talking to Anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening.
17473	7	2	2	Rose is a thoughtful person, she doesn't answer her Aunt Kolab so that she doesn't hurt her.
17483	7	2	2	Rose care about what everyone thinks.  She listened to Anna and helped her get over her bad dream.  She also cared about what Aunt Kolab had to say because she was trying to make live better for Rose.
17495	7	2	2	Rose is obviously an optomistic person. During her conversation with Anna in the kitchen, she talks about how she thinks her brother will find a good job after college, and then pay for their college. This is a positive view that an optomistic person would have.
17506	7	2	2	Rose is a positive person. She thinks the best of each situation, and hopes and dreams that things will get better. In the story, Rose told Anna that Paul would pay for her and Anna's schooling once he got a good job and earned a lot of money.
17513	7	2	2	Based on her conversastions with Anna and Aunt Kolab, the reader knows that Rose is a very understanding young women.  During her conversastion with Anna, Rose explains that Papa had to go to Los Angelos so that he can support the family.  She understands what he had to give up to go work there, and she knows that he is doing it for the good of the family.  Rose also understands that she needs to keep her job. in order to help support the family.  She understands that even if she does win the essay contest she will not be able to travel to Sacramanteo.  She cannot attend because she is willing to work to keep her job.
17515	7	2	2	I think that Rose is loving. When she was talking to Anna all she tried to do was cheer her up. That is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
17518	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Even thought she didnt sleep much and works hard during the day and into the night she still has time to ask Anna if something is wrong.
17525	7	2	2	Rose was a caring niece and daughter because she did not want to hurt her Aunt nor her mother by admitting that she felt weighed down by what she was doing for her family. Rose did not reply to her Aunt's question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason.
17529	7	2	2	Rose is loyal to her family. She feels pressure but still feels the need to help the best way she can. When Rose spoke to her sister about why their father had to leave, telling her the job in Los Angrles paid more, it shows that she is loyal to her family members actions.
17537	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful in the story she realizes maybe her life would get easier.
17539	7	2	2	Rose is very thoughtful, she is always thinking of the future and is worrying about other people and not just herself. Rose is thinking of how she's going to get to college when her family has no money. Rose doesnt want to move to Cambodia and her aunt understands that. Rose is being thoughful when she doesn't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings.
17543	7	2	2	She is hardworking. I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna. In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul's college loans. She isn't indifferent or mad, she only has one thing in mind, and that is that she and her family will pay off the loans and things will be better.
17544	7	2	2	Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. During the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab, Rose is asked if she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do to help her family. Rose does not answer this question, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
17552	7	2	2	optomistic. then he'll get a good job, anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.
17555	7	2	2	Rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings.  Because when she is talking to her aunt she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her feelings.
17560	7	2	2	Rose doesn't like to hurt anybody. When she was taliking to Anna, she wanted to make Anna feel better by telling her about how her dad will be back, and get a better job to pay for Anna's and her's college. When her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this situation, she didn't want to tell her aunt the truth not to hurt her, and she also thinks that Aunt Kolab will tell her mom, and it will hurt her mom too.
17575	7	2	2	One trait that would describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is good with giving her sister hope. By saying to her, 'Then he'll [Paul] get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.', Rose is giving Anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life.
17577	7	2	2	Anna could be desribed as understanding. When Anna walks in the room, she immediately asks her what the matter is, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
17598	7	2	2	Rose seem's very stressed, but she handle's it very well. She doesn't give up and she alway's tries to stay looking at the bright side of thing's. Rose show's this when she's talking to Anna and tell's her 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17599	7	2	2	You can tell that she cares about her little sister. In the story, she tries to calm her little sister down by saying that once they help pay for Paul to graduate, then they will be able to go to college and get good jobs. She's making sure that Anna knows everything will be alright.
17602	7	2	2	Rose is a young girl in her late teenage years. You can tell that she has s high stress level and while she trys to complete all of her tasks without complaint, that it is something that upsets her a lot. A trait you can see Rose has it that she is very respectful of her family. While she is talking to Aunt Kolab, she did not want to tell her that she is so weighed down with everything she has to do so she did not give a response to her aunt when she asked.
17614	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, the reader can tell that Rose is a caring person. She doesn't want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside. In paragraph 19, it shows Rose thinking of others before herself. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. An probably her aunt would tell her mother.'These lines show how Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she is really feeling to keep everyone happy.
17618	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from the conversation with Aunt Kolab is conflicted.  When Aunt kolab asked Rose if she felt so weighed down by what she does to help her family, and she couln't answer becuase the answer she wanted to say would hurt her aunt and she didn't want that.
17619	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose is loyal. There are many things she wants for herself in life. She puts that second though. Her family comes first in everything she does. After school she goes to work, then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner. When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework. All of this is to help her family. Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work. She doesn't answer truthfully, so they don't know how hard all of it is on her. She puts her family first in everything she does.
17620	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate. This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room. Rose immediately took in her sister's body language and asked her what was wrong. She then proceded to try and comfort her sister throughout the conversation by explaining why their parents and others chose to do as they have done.
17634	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She tries to help Anna realize that what is happening in the family will turn out to be a good thing. The event of their dad moving away was for him to get more money. Their brother, Paul, is going to college to get a good job so he will be able to pay for his sisters to go to college. Rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it. This is what she tries to portray to Anna.
17635	7	2	2	She works way too much to where shes falling asleep doing her work. ' I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
17640	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person; she wants everyone else to be happy even if it puts more stress on her. In paragraph 19 Rose thinks to herself that she can not tell the truth, and say the way she really feels because it will upset her aunt and her mother. She did not want to desappoint them but she was too stressed to work all the time.
17643	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is caring. When her sister came into the kitchen, Rose asked what was wrong. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's rong? You feel okay?'
17645	7	2	2	You can tell from the story that Rose is a considerate person. You can understand this from her converstation with Anna. She fakes a laugh, and pretends everything is okay, even when it is not. She tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph 5. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
17646	7	2	2	In the story, Rose is hopeful. In Paragraph 11, she stated that her brother Paul will finish college, in addition, he will get a good job, and then pay for the two sisters college education.
17648	7	2	2	One trait that could describe Rose is that she is trying very hard to support her family and still be able to succeed in her personal goals. In the story, the writer states, 'From school she's gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that is was time to do homework.' One can see that Rose's life is very busy.
17650	7	2	2	If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't want to hurt her family becasue she is caring.
17651	7	2	2	Rose asks her younger sister, Anna, what's wrong and if she is feeling okay. This shows that Rose is a loving person and respects others. She loves her sister very much and you can see that by what questions she asked Anna.
17655	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. When Rose and Anna were talking, Rose asked her what was wrong which showed that she cares about how her sister feels. Also she cares about her family because she doesn't want to let them down with writing her essay.
17660	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic about her future in life. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17663	7	2	2	Emotionaly tough, she is going through alot of stress yet she still trys to comfort her sister when she is sad.
17665	7	2	2	Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.  An example of this is when she says, ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you;re doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer.  If she otld the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
17666	7	2	2	Rose is very responsible, as her telling Anna about their duty helping Paul finish college shows.
17673	7	2	2	She doesn't like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys. Rose didn't answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
17676	7	2	2	One trait that best describes Rose is responsiable. Rose show a great deal of responsablity because she is dealing with a lot to help support her family at such a young age and when he little sister begins to feel tired of the situation, as does Rose. Rose explains to Anna, without grief, that what they are doing is the best for the family. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose said to Anna. She explained that in the long run, and the troubles have settled, that it will benefit them.
17682	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is she is a  understandying person and takes advice from her elders very well. An example from the article is; (last paragraph) Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. (line 21) Rose nodded.
17685	7	2	2	Rose cares for others feelings in the 19th paragraph rose didn't want to teel the truth to her aunt because it would hurt her feelings.
17694	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose would be concern. The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
17702	7	2	2	Rose is carimg. I think she is this way because when she is Aunt Kolab she doesn't complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isn't getting her school work done very well because she is tired. She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.
17705	7	2	2	Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.  Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.  Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college. Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister.
17707	7	2	2	She is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family.
17710	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness. It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college. She is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it.
17725	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is a caring person, that loves and respects her aunt. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings.
17733	7	2	2	Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job.'
17736	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family. You know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college.' This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return.
17739	7	2	2	Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she didn't answer the question.  She didn't want to hurt her aunt.
17742	7	2	2	One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
17746	7	2	2	Rose is  careing person. She firsts askes her sister is she was okay. then Rose states that she and Anna play a big role in helping Paul finish college.
17747	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate. She did not want to Aunt Kolab her real feelings on the situation because she was afraid it was going to hurt her. Instead, she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to Rose possibly having a change in her life.
17748	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate to the feelings of others.  When speaking to Rose, she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation.  She speaks about Paul and how he will eventually come back to help them.
17750	7	2	2	Rose is a hard working girl, who is trying to support her family now because her father is away for right now. She goes from schoolto work then aunts then she has to try and get her homework done all in that days time.
17752	7	2	2	One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful. Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college. In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17755	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
17757	7	2	2	Rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolab when she asked 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' (sentence number 12)
17759	7	2	2	Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
17761	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
17766	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
17771	7	2	2	she is very responsible by trying to help paul finish college, and shes doing everything she can to help her family.
17774	7	2	2	Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.
17775	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful. When she talked to her Aunt Kolab, it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier.' When they had that talk Rose saw eye to eye with her aunt, and no matter how bad things had been, she had hoped for better days.
17779	7	2	2	Rose could be considered protective towards her family. When her little sister Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years', Rose attempts to consul her sister by saying, ' It's only been four months... He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'. Also, Rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family.
17781	7	2	2	Rose is a very responsible girl. She just wants what is best for her family; you can tell my the conversation she had with her little sister Anna. Although they are going through rough times Rose understands that her father is doing the right thing for the situation, and she is greatful that he will pay for their college. Although she isn't happy that her father isn't around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions.
17782	7	2	2	One trait that can decribe Rose is caring. She cares so much about her brother and wants him to graduate from college and will do anything to help him do so.
17783	7	2	2	A trait I can identify from Rose's conversations is that she cares about people in her famil.  For example in paragraph nineteen it say's Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17785	7	2	2	She's caring, because she doesn't want to hurt her Aunts feelings by telling her that she did feel weighted down by what she's doing to help the family.
17804	7	2	2	I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.
17805	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring.In paragraph 19, Rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt. This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person.
17807	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is respectful. She did not tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because Rose did not want to hurt her aunt.
17809	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding. We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna. She understood that Papa had to work to put Paul through college, while Ana did not seem to be so understanding.
17811	7	2	2	Rose is understanding about everything. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17813	7	2	2	She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')
17814	7	2	2	In the story Rose is a very mature girl.  She realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed.  It shows how mature she is in the story when she explains to her sister the importance of Papa being in Los Angeles.  Rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like Mama.
17821	7	2	2	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, you can tell that she cares for her younger sister and the rest of her family. She tries to comfort her sister by gently saying, 'It's only been four months,' when her sister talks about how it seems so long that her father has been gone.
17826	7	2	2	She is really caring and sincere. When talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings.
17827	7	2	2	One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others.  An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says, 'Anna, What's wrong?  You feel okay?'
17828	7	2	2	Rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not, because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. In the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college.
17834	7	2	2	Rose never loses hope.  She always, no matter what situation she is going through, is hopeful.  She knows if she pays her dues now and helps get Paul through college, then he will return the favor.
17835	7	2	2	Rose is considerate. She works hard on her school work, and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesn't want to hurt her or her family. In paragraph 19, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' She is considerate of her family's feelings and their situation.
17836	7	2	2	assuring, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and hel'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17840	7	2	2	The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful. Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college. Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is. This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you.
17843	7	2	2	Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17845	7	2	2	Rose wants to be the big person. She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside. This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab. She doesn't want to tell Aunt Kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother.This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought,      'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably        her aunt would tell her mother.'
17849	7	2	2	Rose can be described as a hard worker. I think this because of the only line in paragraph seven, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
17851	7	2	2	She is very determined. During her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' For a teen, working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition.
17855	7	2	2	Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
17857	7	2	2	That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldn't tell her aunt something that would hurt her.
17858	7	2	2	Rose has a trait of unselfishness. There is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it, in fear that it may hurt the people around her. This trait is evident in paragraph 19 (sentences 1 and 2).

Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna.

She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
17985	7	2	2	Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing. An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17987	7	2	2	respectful. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

18085	7	2	2	Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith.

And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
18127	7	2	2	The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18133	7	2	2	Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.
18141	7	2	2	Anna cares about other people, even when it causes stress for her.  She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college.  She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college.  She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her.
18142	7	2	2	Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
18150	7	2	2	A word that describe her is caring. Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok.

She wants to help Paul, her brother, finish college, so when he gets done he will help her and her sister get through college. The passage states, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18159	7	2	2	One trait that can identify Rose is hopeful. When Rose talks to Anna she tried to make things seem better than they actually were: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
18162	7	2	2	When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.

18166	7	2	2	Rose is considerate of other people's feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18182	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose would be hopeful, because from the story she tell her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18203	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is optimistic; she looks at things positively. Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Even though it's a rough situation, she's looking at what good can come out of it.
18223	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for Paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and Anna to go to college.
18228	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings. After Rose's aunt asks Rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities, Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings.
18230	7	2	2	Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..  The author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18234	7	2	2	She is responsible.  At least she feels responsible for everyone.  If she didn't she would have ignored Anna and got on her paper. But istead, she tried to comfort her and make her see the situation differently and that it will change.
18249	7	2	2	She's caring towards her family memebers. When her and Anna talk about money and Paul on his way to college Rose is concerned about him getting in.
18250	7	2	2	Rose is veryunderstanding. In the story rose understandes why her dad has to work in Los Angeles and tries to get anna to understand as well.

18252	7	2	2	Rose is a giving person she will do anything to help her family: 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college.'

When she talks with anna, Rose tries to make Anna feel better about the fact that their father can't be with them. When she talks with Aunt Kolab, Rose avoids telling her how she really feels, in the interest of keeping from hurting members of her family.
18259	7	2	2	Hopeful because when Anna mentions missing Papa, Rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help Paul finish college and get a good job, and then he could pay for them to go to college.
18264	7	2	2	Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person. Rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family, Rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt.

18292	7	2	2	Rose is a hardworking girl. In her conversation with Anna, it is revealed that she had fallen asleep writing an essay to win a prize from a contest in Sacramento. She is busy and working all day to help pay for her brother's college while still doing school work and helping around the house. The tradition of Cambodia to help family in any way possible is shown through the actions of Rose and her hardworking personality.
18306	7	2	2	Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna. She seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay, but because she thinks it's okay for her Paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying. While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
18307	7	2	2	Rose cares deeply for her sister. Despite the hopelessness that she feels, she tries to make her sister Anna feel better about the situation when, in line 12, she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Despite her internal struggle, Rose pretends that things will work out to give her sister a sense of hope.

18329	7	2	2	Rose is considerate, because in paragraph 19 she is hesitant to tell her aunt the truth, because she is unsure if it will hurt her.
18330	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is comforting.  This trait is displayed in her conversation with Anna when she asks how she is feeling, and when she tries to make the time their father has been gone seem shorter.

18371	7	2	2	Rose is considerate. She is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her, but knows the family needs help.

18420	7	2	2	Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.

18424	7	2	2	Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18428	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'

She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'

18451	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong.
18460	7	2	2	Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'

18493	7	2	2	Very hopeful for good to come to her life. She is optimistic in that she wants everything to be better in her life and she tries to see that through Aunt Kolab and Anna. The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
18494	7	2	2	She has respect for her Aunt Kolab because when she did not answer the question 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18496	7	2	2	Rose is kind at heart. She knows she has a job to look out for her family. She says' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This shows that she cares about her family.

18500	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is respectful. When Rose's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down, Rose did not answer. She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings. Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset.

18506	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation is that shes kind. She feals weighed down by the responsibility of helpeing her family at such a toung age, but wishes not to express her true feelings in fear of making her Aunt Kolab upset, and intern, making her mother upset.
18513	7	2	2	One trait about Rose in this story is when Rose has a conversation with her younger sister Anna. Anna walks in rubbing her eyes, Rose askes her whats wrong and if she feels okay, Rose has a trait of caring for others and being a mom to Anna when their mom isn't home.
18520	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna, she shows that she is selfless. This trait is shown when she says, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school, even though she is exhasuted.
18522	7	2	2	The one trait I depicted from this passage was that Rose is grown up.  When Rose was talking to Anna, she said that 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a job and pay for you and me to go to college.' Next Anna stands up and says Rose sounds like mom.
18526	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is thoughtfulness. When Aunt Kolab asked her if she was so weighed by what she was doing to help the family, she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18528	7	2	2	A trait that Rose shows in her conversation with Aunt Koleb is caring. She begins the conversation with Anna by asking, 'Are you worried?' This shows how she cares about her sister. She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college. Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister, and wants to go to college herself.
18530	7	2	2	I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18535	7	2	2	There are many traits that describe Rose. One of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for Paul's college education. One detail that supprots this trait is when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in Cambodia.
18548	7	2	2	Rose is caring. In the story Rose asks Anna, 'You feel okay?'
18563	7	2	2	Rose is very caring for her brother and sister but she thinks that things are just going down hill since her father left and her mother is working over-time. She has to focus on the family instead of herself, she has to work on getting enough money to help her older brother. She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her. Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
18564	7	2	2	Determined, she sticks to what is important to her. Like When She feel asleep working on her essay.
18568	7	2	2	One character trait that describes Rose is thoughtfulness.     'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18574	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person. She does not like hurting other people. In paragraph 19 it says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18581	7	2	2	This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl.  The story shows this trait in her when Rose says to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  This sentence shows that Rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that Paul, she still has to help him finish college.  Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
18587	7	2	2	1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.
18599	7	2	2	Rose can be described by the the word caring. She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna. When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care. For example she says,'Whats wrong? You feel okay?'
18601	7	2	2	Rose is caring and doesn't like to upset others. When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.' which shows that she doesn't want to see her aunt get hurt.
18608	7	2	2	One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out. Not only did this make Rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay, and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad.
18610	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18625	7	2	2	In the story Crossing Over, the character Rose is very hard working. When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay. Another thing Rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help Paul, the older brother, finish college. Later in the story she is talking to her aunt, and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family. These example show that Rose is a very hard worker.
18626	7	2	2	She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.
18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
18644	7	2	2	Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
18649	7	2	2	Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.
18654	7	2	2	She is optimistic, she tells Anna that when Paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college.
18661	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
18664	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
18666	7	2	2	One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.
18669	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job.
18670	7	2	2	One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18676	7	2	2	In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.  It shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her, as well as the rest of her family, to work hard to support one another.
18677	7	2	2	I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18685	7	2	2	Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.
18691	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
18692	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
18697	7	2	2	Rose puts her family before herself. This can be seen when she is talking to Anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college.
18705	7	2	2	Rose is caring, when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family. Does not tell her that she is. She does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her.
18717	7	2	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
18718	7	2	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker.
18727	7	2	2	She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18730	7	2	2	Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
18735	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.
18737	7	2	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'
18749	7	2	2	A trait that Rose haswould be hope. We can see this trait when she is talking to her sister Anna and she says, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.
18759	7	2	2	A trait that Rose has is caring for other people. When Rose is talking to Anna she tells her that they have a part to do to help Paul finish college.
18760	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna she explains that money is not every thing only if you already have everything. This part of the story reviels how stresed Rose is. However she also is greatful for the fact that Paul will pay for her's and her sister's college.
18765	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person who cares what other people feel. Like when her aunt asked her, 'Do you feel so weighed down y what youre doing to help this family?' she didnt want to answer because she new it would hurt her aunts feelings.
18769	7	2	2	Rose is a hardworking girl.While talking with her sister she said that as she was finishing her homework, she fell asleep.
18772	7	2	2	Rose has the trait of determination. She shows this determination of wanting her family to succeed and and make other options possible.'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'(11).
18775	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is caring. In the story Rose asked her younger sister what was wrong, instead of saying not bothering to say anything.
18782	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring and kind hearted person.  During her conversation with Anna she tries to explain why their father is working a job in Los Angeles so that Anna isn't so mad or upset. Then when Anna leaves the room, Rose follows her to try and explain more, but Anna is already asleep.  Rose also had a conversation with Aunt Kolab in which the reader can tell that she is caring or kind hearted.  Her aunt asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she is having to do to help the family. When her aunt asks this question, Rose didn't want to answer because she didn't want to hurt her aunts feelings. After she realizes that her aunt is sincere in asking this question, and she will be understanding of Rose's response, Rose answered the question.
18783	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is responsible. Rose works to help support her family and takes responsibility in comforting her younger sister Anna by telling her that they have a part to do to help their family.
18787	7	2	2	Rose is supportive, a trait exemplified in her conversation with Anna. Rose hides her feelings in order to explain to Anna the necessity of their parents' actions. She does her best to comfort her sibling and back up her family.
18793	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic. She believs that her brother will get a good job after he finishes college and will help out her parents with the cost of school for Rose and Anna.
18800	7	2	2	Rose shows that she is sympathetic when she says to Anna, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
18803	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is respectful or nice because she doesn't answer her aunt because if she told the truth she thought she would hurt her aunt's feelings.
18804	7	2	2	Based on the story Rose seems like a very caring person and that she will do whatever it takes to ensure that she helps someone get whatever they want or get anywhere that they want to in life. Rose gives up alot, and lives her life in the situation that she does becuase becuase she knows that is what's best. In her conversation with Anna Rose basicly tells her to keep sticking through it and it'll pay off by reminding her 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for me and you to go to college.' She sees that what shes doing right now in the present is what is going to get her where she needs to go in the future. She's a very strong, smart person.
18806	7	2	2	Rose is respectful of her relitives feelings because in paragraph 19 it said she didn't answer because if she told the truth it might hurt her aunts feelings
18807	7	2	2	I think Rose is caring, but she is just too pressured to stay focused and do what she wants to do. You know she cares by her still trying to write a three-thousand-word essay, when she has school, and a job to concentrate on. For her to put that much work in for her family shows she cares a lot about them.
18808	7	2	2	Rose is overwhelmed with work. She feels what her family is going through and is trying to help but is scared. She has to go to school, then go to work, and on top of that she has to do homework and help take care of her family.
18809	7	2	2	Rose is a positive person who tries and reassures her sister as much as possible. She really cares about her family and tries to take her responsibilities maturely. We can see this in her conversation with Anna. When Anna is complaining about her father going off to work, Rose reassures her by saying that it's only been 4 months. Then she continues saying, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' We can see that she cares about her brother and is positive about the work she must endure to help him succeed.
18812	7	2	2	I think that rose is worried about her family and all the other conflicts in her life. She is very aware of everything that is going on in her life. When she was talking to Anna she said that her brother had to go and get a job in Los Angeles becasue it paid three times more. She also said that when Paul finishes college he's going to get a good paying job and that he will pay for thier college.
18813	7	2	2	Rose seems positive. She said, 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18814	7	2	2	Rose is very hopeful. Internally, she may have her doubts about all of her family's struggles, but she suppresses her worries and does what she has to for her family.A good example of this is during her conversation with Anna about how they have their part to do to help Paul finish college so  that he can get a good job and pay for them to go to college.
18816	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful person.  In the story, she is always trying to find a way to help her family.
18821	7	2	2	Caring. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18824	7	2	2	Rose is strong-hearted and head strong. She understands that her situations in life are difficult right now having to go to work, make supper, go to school, and do homework, but she keeps her head up and still believes that everything will get better in time. She is optimistic about a lot of situations such as the conversation with her sister Anna.
18827	7	2	2	Rose is caring. She seems concerned when Anna walks in and she asks Anna if she feels okay.
18828	7	2	2	She is positive. Even though she is feeling the same way, and like she has to do all the work she still kept a positive attitude. She faked it to make her sister feel better. For example she talked about how Paul is going to finish college then pay for them to get good jobs. She was saying that they wouldn't have to suffer for too long.
18831	7	2	2	I could use many words to describe this young Cambodian girl named Rose she's helpful, caring, smart, gracious, and very reseponsible but I believe that the word that suites her the most is mature.     Rose is very mature, she is handling her situation quite well, she's not going around and complaining about how much she has on her plate she's trying her best to keep a positive view on things. She works a four-hour shift at a restaurant, goes to school and still helps out with household chores like helping her Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.     She's a young adult and has a very high level of maturity for tackling all her tasks and being a strong role model for her younger sister Anna thats why I would describe rose as mature.
18832	7	2	2	"""Caring; 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'"""
18835	7	2	2	Caring:     Rose said 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18837	7	2	2	Rose doesnt like to hurt peoples feeling. You can tell because when her aunt asked if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family she knew how she felt she just didnt want to tell her aunt the truth because she didnt want her to be upset.
18846	7	2	2	In the story, Rose is the main character. This main character displays kindness. It can be easily noticed in the conversation  that she has with Aunt Kolab. When they are talking, Rose suppresses her feelings. She is under the impression that she may offend her aunt, so she does not mention how she really feels. These traits show that Rose tries to be kind even when she is under quite a lot of stress.
18847	7	2	2	1. Rose is selfless, because she is willing to do something for her family that she does not want to do, and she does not want to let Aunt Kolab know how she feels, because she thinks it might hurt her aunt.
18854	7	2	2	Considerate,  she didnt want to tell her aunt she felt weighed down by the family because she didn't want it to hurt her.
18856	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is that she is kind because in the story she askes Anna when she walks in her room whats the matter.
18868	7	2	2	Rose seems strong in supressing her true feelings on the situation, and assures Anna that everything will be okay. She appears to be quite an optimistic person.
18870	7	2	2	Rose talked to anna in a sencer, loving way. ' Anna,' Rose said. 'what's wrong? You feel ok?'
18878	7	2	2	Rose is a respectful person. She seems very busy with work and school but does not complain about it. One detail from the story is that she did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she is feeling weighed down by helping the family.
18884	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is when her younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' That shows that Rose cares about her and is very respectful.
18885	7	2	2	Rose is very stressed about helping her family for she feels overwhelmed. But at the same time she doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab that she is feeling stressed because she knows that Aunt Kolab will most likely be hurt by the information. This proves that Rose is thoughtful of other people's feelings and caring, even when she doesn't feel well herself.
18886	7	2	2	rose is a careing person becuse she says 'whats rong? you feel ok. this tells that she cares for her sister becuse she could of not said eny thing and she wouldent know what her sisters thinking about.
18887	7	2	2	She is caring because when her Aunt Kolab ask her questions about if she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family Rose didn't want to answer because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or mother.
18893	7	2	2	One trait the identifies Rose is that she has alot of fate in believe her family will hopefully come out of debt sometime and will not have to worry about money anymore. An example would be when she says that their dad had to go to Los Angoles for a new job so he could get paid more money and some day return, at the same time their brother is going to college and once his finishes and gets a good job, their dad and brother will help pay them two to go off to college.
18896	7	2	2	Rose is a strong induvidual, because she does alot for her family and stays strong for them. An example of this is in paragraph 11 sentences 2 and 3. 'She tried a laugh and that even sounded fake to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college' This shows that Rose is trying to stay strong for Anna and her family by supporting Paul.
18897	7	2	2	The trait that I would give to Rose during her conversation with Anna is strength, because Rose is also upset about her father being away for four months but she decides not to get discouraged about it.
18900	7	2	2	Rose is caring towards her sister. She gives her sister Anna a logical explanation as to why their father moved for work, rather than complain about how much she misses him too. In a way she is trying to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family.
18901	7	2	2	She is caring. She knows that Paul needs to go to college to get a job so that he can pay them back, but Anne just thinks about it now. Although, Anne is right about money isn't everything.
18903	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person, and this becomes evident when she askes Anna if shes feeling okay after Anna has had a bad dream.
18907	7	2	2	Hopeful     ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
18909	7	2	2	Rose is a very hard-working young woman. As her aunt had asked her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Poor Rose has had to work four-hour shifts on top of going to school in order to support her brother through college so that, in return, he can work and support Rose and her sister come time for them to go to college.
18912	7	2	2	One trait that you could give Rose is that she a hardworker, because when she came to the essay and she didn't have anything to write about. She didn't give up or put it off and not do the essay. She continued to try to find a topic to write about.
18913	7	2	2	Rosa is very motherly. When Anna walks in the room Rosa's first response is to ask, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' This shows how she cares for her and her family.
18920	7	2	2	Rose has a trait of protectiveness. This is shown through her conversation with Anna when she hides her emotions from Anna. This is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well. This will give Anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control. Another example is when Anna first walks in and the first thing Rose does is ask if she is ok.
18921	7	2	2	Rose is a very kind person.  She asks how her sister feels and goes to her room to check on her.
18927	7	2	2	Rose is very determind but she is also being wighed down by other things like the essay she is doing to help her family. She is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother.
18940	7	2	2	She is a very respectful person because Rose didnt answer her Aunt Kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family.
18946	7	2	2	Rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion, as can be seen when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' to Anna.
18949	7	2	2	Rose is caring, because ' If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18961	7	2	2	Rose always tried to do what was best for her family.  It was not until her dream about Paul's body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was. As soon as her aunt suggested taking some of the weight off of Rose and doing more to help, Rose instantly felt a little bit more relaxed, and grateful towards her aunt.
18963	7	2	2	Rose is encouraging. She was having a very rough day when Anna walked into the kitchen. Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Despite her feelings, she tried to encourage Anna and keep their conversation postive.
18964	7	2	2	'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.'She seems undecided, but she's willing to take things as they come. She has a half positive outlook on things.
18975	7	2	2	Rose is very determined. She does everything she can to help pay for her brother's college, even though she is exhausted and stressed. In the conversation between Rose and Anna in paragraph 11, Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This statement shows that Rose knows how important it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard times to get the money for her brother.
18977	7	2	2	One of the traits that Rose has is careing. During the conversation with Anna, Rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay. She cares about her and her family. One other example would be when she is talkin to Aunt Kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle. She doesnt want to upset them, because she cares about how they feel.
18979	7	2	2	Rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels. For example when Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'if she feels wieghed down by what she is doing for her family'. Rose's response is,' if i told the truth, i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother.
18980	7	2	2	Rose felt more hopeful after talking to her aunt. The story tells us that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.
18990	7	2	2	She has faith in everything she does, and she cares about her sister. I believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother.
19000	7	2	2	Rose is selfless. When Anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare, she started talking about how she misses Papa and she wishes Mama didn't have to work such late hours. Anna, I'm sure, felt the same way, but she hid her feelings because she had to make Anna feel better. She had to put her little sister before herself.
19001	7	2	2	rose respects and cares about how other people might thin before she speaks. in the story she didnt want to tell her aunt something because she didnt want to hurt her feelings.
19003	7	2	2	Detuermined,eshe said that they had to do their part to help paul get thru college then he will get a good job and he'll pay for them to go to college.
19015	7	2	2	Rose is generous. She doesn't tell about how she really feels because she's concerned about everyone else. It is shown in paragraph 18 Aunt Kolab says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing for this family?'. Then in paragraph 19 when the narrator states, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. This shows that Rose is generous and concerned of the well-being of others.
19017	7	2	2	She is stressed, and seems to be having trouble managing everything that needs to be done, but she is willing to do it to help out her family. In her converstation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish College. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This passage shows that she is aware of how hard it is now, but all her work will pay off eventually.
19022	7	2	2	Rose respects her Aunt Kolab and in paragrapg 19, she did't want to tell the truth and her Aunt Kolab's feelings in some way.
19034	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of those around her. She supresses her own feelings to make others feel better, as shown in the following quote: 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Rose does not tell her aunt what she is truly feeling so as not to upset nor disappoint her aunt.
19036	7	2	2	Rose appears very mature. She attempts to make an explanation for her father when Anna comes out to talk. She also shows maturity when she chooses to talk about her problems with her Aunt Kolab.
19039	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with her younger sister Anna is that Rose is optimistic. One detail from the story that can support this is when she is explaining to Anna that Paul, their brother, will get a good job and pay for Anna and Rose to go to college. Rose is displaying her sense of optimism by talking about the good things that will happen in the future.
19040	7	2	2	Rose is very mature about her family problems. The example in the would be when she tells Anna 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paide three times what he was making here.'     She understands and still misses her father just as much as Anna.
19046	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person who tries not to hurt anyone. You know this by the way the author stated that she tried to tell Anna as gentle as she could that their father had only been gone for four months. She wants tobe free, but rather she would want the happiness of her own family before hers. Since Rose is a caring person,  maybe that is why she didn't wan to hurt her aunt's feelings when they were having a conversation.
19051	7	2	2	I think one trait that can describe Rose would be how caring and unselfish she is. In the story Rose says, with her hands cupped, 'Pauls fate lies partly in these.' She cares abut Paul so that is why she tries so hard in everything she does.
19057	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding. She isn't stubborn about doing things that other American teenagers wouldn't ever have to do. She understands that her family needs her help in supporting her brother, sister, and everyone else. One detail from the story would be this: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college...' found in paragraph 11, line 2.
19063	7	2	2	Rose is understandig, because she understood that her father went away for a better paying job.
19064	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is very caring of other people. In paragraph 19, sentence 2, Rose chooses not to answer Aunt Kolab's question. If she tells her the truth, Rose knows that the statement will hurt her, so she doesn't say it.
19065	7	2	2	Rose is responsible in here conversation with Anna. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She is helping her brother through college so she can then go to college too. That shows a great deal of responsiblity.
19074	7	2	2	She is caring. In paragraph 5 she is conserned about her sister and ask her if she's feeling okay.
19078	7	2	2	Rose is sympathetic towards her family. I know this because in Rose's and her and Aunt Kolab's conversation Rose didnt answer when her aunt asked, 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' because she knows if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And her aunt would probably of told her mother.
19080	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is hope. Even though her family is having hard times, she is still hoping her and Anna will be able to go to college. Rose shows hope when she says: 'we gave our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he`ll get a good job, Anna, and he`ll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19081	7	2	2	Rose is very dedicated to her family and is willing to do what she can to help them.Rose has a job to help put her brother through college and she helps her aunt cook dinner when her mother is at work.
19084	7	2	2	Rose is thoughtfull. When she was asked if she felt like she was being weighed down by having to take a big role in taking care for her family, she kind of knodded instead of complaining about it to her aunt.
19086	7	2	2	Rose seems like the type of person who would worry to much. But at the same time she likes to help people and she cares about other people too. For example, Rose asks her sister if she was okay to see what was wrong with her.
19092	7	2	2	I would describe her as strong willed, because when she is talking with her aunt Kolab she knows she is doing alot but doesn't complain about it.
19095	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person that does not want to hurt anyone's feelings. You can tell this because, when she is talking to both her aunt and her sister she tries to down play  her true feeling so neither person worries about her. One example of this is when Rose does not answer her aunt for fear of hurting her.
19098	7	2	2	Rose is very kind, she doesn't like to hurt other people's feelings. For example, when she was talking to her Aunt, she didn't want to hurt her by telling her she felt she was doing too much for the family.
19099	7	2	2	Rose has a good trait that is for looking for hope. When she was talking to her aunt she relized that it won't always be like this. Rose also reliazes that with a little help it will be better. In the story it says Rose kept nodding her head. This shows us that the she found hope and know that it will be better soon.
19111	7	2	2	one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with  aunt kolab is that she respects others feelings. one detail from the story is when it says 'rose didnt answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

Even though she does not necessarily enjoy working to support her brother in college, she knows that it is her duty to do it and she works anyways.  She takes the responsibility to help her brother because she knows in the future he will help her.
19127	7	2	2	One trait that can describe rose based on her conversations is that is very caring about others feelings and does not want to say anything hurtful.  One detail that supports this is how she would not share how she felt weighed down to her aunt because the truth would hurt Aunt Kolab.
19131	7	2	2	To me Rose seems caring. Her younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes.'Anna ,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. ' I just had another bad dream.''I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
19132	7	2	2	Responsibilty is a trait she shows she may not wnt it but she has it. She has it because she must help pay to get her brother though college so that he can get a good job and send her and her sister to college to. She does feel that she has to much responsibilty because but she has to so this to have a future.
19140	7	2	2	Rose cares so much about her family that she is willing to anything, she is just so exhausted from working and taking care of everyone. Her trait that she shows is love. All Rose can think about is how to make her family and help with whatever she has to until she can go to college.

In her converstion with Aunt Kolab she was afraid to answer truthfully because she didn't want to hur her aunt.
19162	7	2	2	Based upon the story, it can be concluded that Rose cares about other people's feelings.  In paragraph 19, Rose does not allow her aunt to realize that she feels so greatly burdened by her responsiblities.  She believes that if her aunt were to know this fact, she would be hurt and will also tell her mother, who then would also be hurt.
19164	7	2	2	I think one trait that would best describe Rose would be had working. In the story Rose is so busy because she is trying to help her family as best as she can and starts to feel pressured by it. Rose does a lot. She goes to work, comes home, help make dinner, and does her homework. I thinkg that shows that she is hardworking because most people crack and fail but she keeps doin because she wants to help her family and go to a good college.
19165	7	2	2	Rose is a understanding person. Rpse acknowledges that her dad has to be away so that her brother can go to coellege and get a good job. Rose understands that she is helping to put Paul through coellege and he will help her and Anna.

19197	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding girl.  She recognizes that some hard decisions are made for the best.  She knows that her father had to take the job in Los Angeles because it paid three times what he made originally.
19198	7	2	2	Rose looks at the bright side of things. When her sister, Anna was talking about how she missed their father Rose was the one saying that it was a good thing that he was gone because their family needs the money.
19200	7	2	2	Rose is caring and hardworking, in paragraph 11 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then hel'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to collage.' Right their shows that Rose is working at somthing and she cares about someone because she knows it will pay off in the long run.
19201	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be understanding.Detail:  'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'Although she probably wants her father there like her sister, she is understanding as to why he had to leave.
19202	7	2	2	Based on her conversations, Rose can be described as caring. During her conversation with Anna, Rose kept trying to sound postive and look on the bright side of things. When Anna talked about how long it seemed that their father had been gone, Rose tried to make it seem better by reminding Anna that 'It's only been four months.' By doing this, you can tell that Rose cares about her sister's feelings.
19203	7	2	2	One of Rose's traits would be that she is hard working. In the story she talks about how she goes to school, then she works a 4 hour shift, and after that she gets home and does her homework.
19206	7	2	2	Rose seems to be very understanding, she's willing to do anything to help Paul with college and doesn't second guess it. When she's talking to Anna she tells her,'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19212	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. We see this when she talks to Anna. She asks Anna what's wrong instead of going straight to herself falling asleep on her essay.
19227	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hope.  Aunt Kolab gave Rose the feeling of hope by exploring other options that could benefit the family.  One detail that supports my answer is Rose recognizing that her life would get easier if people search opportunities to help support their family.
19233	7	2	2	Considerate, when she was talking to Aunt Kolab, instead of telling her how she really felt, she did not say anything because she knew it would hurt her Aunt's feelings.
19237	7	2	2	She is worried about other peoples feelings. when anna woke from a dream, rose asked her what was wrong and poured her a glass of orange juice. and when she was talking to her aunt, she didnt want to hurt her feelings
19239	7	2	2	She is a responsible girl, based on the part where she is talking about helping her brother pay for college so that he can help when she goes to college.
19241	7	2	2	Rose is a girl who really cares about her family and if something needs to be done she will do it. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Aunt Kolab asks if rose feels weighed down and because Rose didnt want to hurt her  aunt and felt like it was her job she did not tell her aunt the truth. Showing that she cares for her family and she will do what needs to be done.
19245	7	2	2	She doesnt like to hurt peoples feelings, she vents to her sister and when her aunt comes home she she asks her whats wrong but she doesnt answer she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings.   In the story her aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family'? she doesnt answer, she knows what she wants to say will hurt her aunts feelings.
19252	7	2	2	Hopeful. Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.
19253	7	2	2	Rose, when speaking to Aunt Kolab, shows a great deal of respect. I know this because when her aunt asked her about being weighed down, Rose didn't want to say her real answer because it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mothers feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' As you can see in this qoute from the passage, this supports my conclusion.
19255	7	2	2	Well, Rose seems like a very hard working young women, by having school, a job, and coming home to help her aunt make a quick supper. Also after all of that, do her homework. paragraph one.
19258	7	2	2	In Rose's conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as selfless, is not worrying about herself, but about her brother, and putting him through college so she and her sister can go to college, but at the same time she is trying to comfort her sister and assure her that everything that the family is for the best. It is for Anna and Rose's future. This is shown when Anna and Rose are speaking of how their parents are working so hard they hardly get to spend time with their family, but Rose tells her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This passage shows how Rose is selfless, comforting her sister, even when she is drowing under the pressure she is under, so her family has a better future.
19259	7	2	2	One trait that can descrive Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she thinks about other peoples feelings. One example from the story that supports that she thinks about other peoples feeling is when she is talking to her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 19 when she said 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
19260	7	2	2	In her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as being a maternal figure for Anna. Rose tries to calm Anna after her bad dream, and not tell her how she really feels about the situation their family was in.
19261	7	2	2	A trait that describes Rose is she cares about her family and their feelings. A detail from the story that supports my answer is when Anna is talking with her aunt she does not want to tell her aunt the truth because she is afraid it will hurt her feelings.
19265	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She cares for her family dearly. She only wants what's best for her family. Rose unlike Anna understands that you have to make sacrifices for a better life. So though it might be hard now. It will later be better for her and her family.
19266	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very giving and wants to help her brother and her family but is stressed about it. I also think she realizes it will get better and in the end she will have help from everyone in her family, just as they are helping her brother. Like she said to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll find a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19270	7	2	2	She is caring. She asks her sister what is wrong and if she is feeling okay.
19278	7	2	2	She trys to help other people out however she can, she shows this because she is helping paul finish college.
19284	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Anna would be motivation.  Anna has a lot of motivation to help her family.  She doesn't want to see her family struggle so she does everything she can to help out like earning money by working at a restaurant.  A detail form the story that supports my answer would be when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19288	7	2	2	In the story, Rose stated, 'I'm insane,' in paragraph 3. The impression that I get from her is that she is overwhelmed with things. It seems as if she is in a hopeless state of mind. People expect her to do her best, and she believes that people think too highly of her. But towards the end of the story, her emotions change when her and her aunt are having a conversation. In paragraph 23, it states, 'Maybe her life will get better.' Now she is in a hopeful state of mind. Rose seems to be the type of person that is easily influenced and let's things get to her at times.
19290	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful. Rose said 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19292	7	2	2	According to the text one trait of Anna's would be that she really cares about her family. It goes to show in the text the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab. Rose feels weighed down by the family because her dad departed to Los Angeles to take a job and her mother always works late.
