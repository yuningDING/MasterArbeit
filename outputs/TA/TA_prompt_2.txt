2789	2	3	3	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2797	2	3	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2801	2	3	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
2803	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2811	2	3	3	"""(a) Plastic type """"B"""" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."""
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2817	2	3	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2821	2	3	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
2849	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2852	2	3	3	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
2853	2	3	3	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
2857	2	3	3	"""a) Plastic type/polymer """"B"""" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in """"B""""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."""
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2874	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
2881	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2889	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
2896	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
2905	2	3	3	"""A0 I conclude that plastic type """"B"""" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic """"A"""" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."""
2912	2	3	3	"""Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. """"step 1"""" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"""". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment."""
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2918	2	3	3	(A) Based on the data shown in the experiment plastic B had the most stretchability and plastic A had the least stretchability. ^p (B) They could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
2922	2	3	3	(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
2928	2	3	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
2946	2	3	3	The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest.
2947	2	3	3	The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
2948	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
2949	2	3	3	a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
2950	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
2954	2	3	3	2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.  The students could have conducted more trials (which could have improved the experimental design and validity). The students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment, they would known how much weight to add.
2962	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
2963	2	3	3	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
2966	2	3	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2969	2	3	3	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
2974	2	3	3	A) From the table results for the experiment, you can conclude that type B was the most stretchable out plastic and type A was the strongest at holding together, the polymers and cross linking made it strong. ^p B) She could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2981	2	3	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3013	2	3	3	"""The data provided concludes that plastic type """"B"""" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."""
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3026	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3062	2	3	3	"""a.) Based on the students data, plastic type """"B"""" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."""
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3190	2	3	3	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3203	2	3	3	"""A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say """"weights"""" by adding how heavy the weights are."""
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3213	2	3	3	"""a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says """"take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"""". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 """"add some weights"""" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."""
3226	2	3	3	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3244	2	3	3	"""According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to """"add weight"""" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."""
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3344	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3433	2	3	3	"""Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the """"stretchiest"""" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."""
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3483	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3496	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
3497	2	3	3	"""a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that """"plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."""
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3531	2	3	3	"""Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic """"B"""" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying """"add weights""""."""
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3621	2	3	3	"""Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to """"add weight ..."""" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."""
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3694	2	3	3	"""a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"""", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."""
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3821	2	3	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
3837	2	3	3	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3864	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3888	2	3	3	"""A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the """"weight""""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."""
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3936	2	3	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
4067	2	3	3	A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.
4073	2	3	3	"""A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment"""
4075	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.
4078	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.
4093	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretched the least, making it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results. 2. The student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic.
4094	2	3	3	A conclusion that I can draw from this data is that plastic type B, stretched the most on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed, and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored, and controlled.
4100	2	3	3	The group can conclude that plastic type B, is the most effective type of plastic. According to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results. Along with that being said, the group also should have measured the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results.
4111	2	3	3	Based on the data one can conclude that plastic type B has the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is greater than any other types. ^P Two ways that the student could've improved the validity of the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to every polymer.
4113	2	3	3	A) Plastic B has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic I have tested. The least stretched plastic is plastic type A which was at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretched to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C was at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D was at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability. B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. Another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area.
4114	2	3	3	Based on the data plastic B stretched the most out of all the plastics. So plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the four plastics. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it only stretche10-12mm and plastic B stretched 22-23mm. The students should have stated how much weight was more used and if they used the same amount of weights for each plastic. Also the plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity.
4115	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength because it stretched the farthest in both trials, and plastic type A has the least tensile strength, because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b) The students could have indicated how many millimeters of plastic should be taped on top of the table, and indicated how heavy each weight should be.
4118	2	3	3	In the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability. In this experiment, plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. The results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment. To improve this experiment, I would run a third and fourth trial to develop an average amount stretched for each plastic type. Additionally, I would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched.
4122	2	3	3	Freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type B stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity. They could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant. Also they could add more trials to increase the validity.
4138	2	3	3	a. The students data concludes that plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b. The student could have made all the plastics the same starting length and added the same amount of weights each time.
4139	2	3	3	a) based on the student's data I can conclud that plastic type A stretched the least at 10mm T1 and 10mm on T2. plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm on T1 and 23mm on T2. b) Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp.
4143	2	3	3	The plastic type (B) stretched out the more in both trials than the other types of plastic.^p One way they could improve their experiment was to tell us how much weight they used on the clamps.^p Another one is they could have written down the length of plastic before they started to see the difference.
4145	2	3	3	Based on the students data you can conclude that Plastic B stretched the farthest and Plastic A stretched the least. Two ways this student could have improved this experiment is by providing the start length of each plastic before the weights are added. Another thing they could do to improve this experiment is to include the weight that was added to the clamp for each plastic.
4148	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, the polymer plastic B is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the validity of the trial could be to add one or two more trials. Also, he could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot.
4149	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights. ^p The student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant. They also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Both of these would help improve the validity of the data.
4159	2	3	3	A. I could conclude from this students experiment that plastic B, was the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table.
4160	2	3	3	a) With the results provided, it is shown that plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second, compared to plastic A this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. B) The students should have specified the weights amount that was to be added to the plastic. They should have also said how much of the plastic should be taped to the table, different amounts could affect the amount of weight it could hold.
4162	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials. Therefore, it would most likely break faster than the others. Plastic type A stretched the least amount so, it would probably hold more before breaking. B) The students could have performed more trials. They could've also, use the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic. It doesn't say how much weight they used, just to add weights.
4168	2	3	3	Overall plastic B stretched the most followed by plastic D, C, then A. This lab needs a lot of work for it to be valid. First the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics need to be on the table because although plastic B is the longest in the end, it may have started at 20mm, but we don't know. Also they should do more trials.
4171	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastics B and D are the most stretchable because they stretched the most in trial 1. Plastic B stretched 22 mm and plastic D stretched 20 mm. ^p The student could have specified how heavy the weights should be on the plastics. Also the student must use plastic samples of the same lengths so the results have more validity.
4174	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can conclude that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One way the student could have improved this experiment, would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control.
4185	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude the B stretched the highest and A stretched the least. ^P b) The students could have told us how much the weights weighed. They also could have told us the original length of the plastic before stretching it.
4187	2	3	3	a) I conclude that plastic B was the highest stretching plastic according to the graph it stretched 23mm, plastic A is the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two. ^P b) This experiment could have been improved by having each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic. The chart should include the original starting lengths of each of the plastics and the ending length.
4192	2	3	3	A conclusion drown based on the students' data would be plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the validity of the results is to have each type of plastic start at the same length. The students could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of weights on each plastic.
4195	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretched the most at an avarage of 22.5 mm. ^p b. Add more trials. Explain how much waights are they using. How much of tape to use.
4211	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B  is the plastic that stretched the most, plastic A was the one that stretched the least.^p b) The students can improve the experiment by adding another trial. Also we could have mentioned how much weight he put on the clamp.
4215	2	3	3	The students data shows that plastic B stretched the most (22mm & 23 mm), however this may not be valid because you don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. The students can improve the results by using the same length for each plastic. Also, they can include how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to improve the experimental design.
4218	2	3	3	In the students experiment it is clear that polymer B is the most stretchable, than D, C, and last A. The students could use more trials, with these the experiment becomes more valid. The students also could have said the size of the plastics sample, since the size is in the final measurement, this could alter the results by a lot.
4221	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, at 22.5mm average.^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and the location on the table to put the tape, in case it is moved by the weights.
4222	2	3	3	A) B first the one plastic that's the stretchiest, while A is the least stretchiest C. ^P B) One way is by having a third trial to make shure, your data is corrected and by taking down how long the plastic was before you stretched it.
4228	2	3	3	"""a) Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B has the highest stretchability i.e lasticity. This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only """" measuring the length of plastic types"""" for """" three plastic samples"""". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, making the results more valid."""
4230	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results.
4231	2	3	3	a) You can't really draw a conclusion because, the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) They could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be.
4234	2	3	3	The strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials. The weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials.  So two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps.
4239	2	3	3	(a) The conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretched to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It was stretched 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improve the validity of the data, the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weights added to the clamp, keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results.
4240	2	3	3	Plastic type A had the least stretchability at an average of 11 mm while plastic type B stretched the most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p The amount of weight added should be included in the procedure to make the test more valid. Preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here.
4245	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B) All the plastics should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is being put on the different types of plastics.
4249	2	3	3	a) If plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic B will stretch the farthest. This is supported by the data because in T1 and T2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data.They also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment.
4250	2	3	3	"""a) According to the data, plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C was the second strongest, followed by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial."""
4252	2	3	3	A. In conclusion plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could've improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed.
4254	2	3	3	A) A conclusion is that plastic type B has stretched the farthest in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in trial 2 reaching 23mm. The other 3 plastic types did not stretch as far as plastic B.^P B) The student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics were before they were stretched and adding that data in the table. Also the student could have made sure each plastic was the same length and width before each of them were stretched. The student should have also listed the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic.
4255	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that in both ones plastic type B has to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics. This data is not valid because there are many places within the experiment to increase the validity. The students could have recorded the starting length and ending length. Also they should have add the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial.
4258	2	3	3	a) Based on the data ,I can assume that plastic B has the most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm.^p b) One way the student could here improved the experiment design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othey are constant .Also the student could have specified the amount of weight that was out on the clamp and the  student could also have made the amount of weight a constant.
4262	2	3	3	a) After recording the data, it is obvious that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit. Another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched.
4264	2	3	3	Based on the students data, polymer plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because the millimeters stretched on B trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length. (control)
4276	2	3	3	The student's data clearly shows tat plastic B has the most stretchability. In that one it stretching to 22 mm, and in trial two it stretched to 23. Plastic D was a close second with 20 mm for  both trials. Plastic C stretched 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second. Finally plastic A stretched the least. It is obvious that plastic B was the stretchiest in Comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second. To improve the experimental design of the students could make sure the pieces of plastic are the same length also they could use the same clamp and weights to ensure that the weigths added
4277	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, it is clear that plastic type B is the most stretchy because it was able to stretch 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type A was the least stretchable because it was only stretched 10mm and 12mm. This is a difference of about 10mm. ^p The students should have specified the length of the plastics making it consistent for all the different types would ensure a valid experiment in which only one variable was tested. Also, they should have given a specific weight to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid.
4284	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B was the most flexible plastic A streches the least with an average growth of 11mm while in comparison, plastic B had an average strech of 22.5mm. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experiment design and be the validity of the experiment are, specify the a from of weight used and on another trial with heavier weights. This will further parsue the plan and make sure all data accurate. Another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiment is to start out with the same amount of each platic, instead of measuring different lengths to start with.
4290	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most compared to the other plastics while plastic C did not stretch at all. The students could improve the experiment by listing the starting measures of each plastic and performing three trials instead of 2.
4293	2	3	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability with an average of 22.5 mm stretch, followed by plastic type D, averaging 20 mm, then plastic type C, averaging 13.5 mm, then the plastic with the lowest stretchability was plastic type A, averaging 11 mm of stretch. ^P B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by including that all the plastic types were equally cut and measure. They could have also included to use the same amount of weights for each trial or experiment.
4294	2	3	3	In conclusion the graph shown states that plastic (type B) streched the most compared to the rest of the types of plastic. ^P One way the student can improve this experiment would he to use the same weights for each type of plastic. Another way would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial.
4308	2	3	3	(A) Plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic of all the bags because it stretched 22mm (Trial 1) & 23 (trial 2) while the other plastics didn't stretch as much. ^p (B) The student could've improved the experimental design by stating how many weights to place on the plastic and how much each weight weighs. Also, they could've stated how much of the plastic should be taped onto the table and how much should hang freely.
4309	2	3	3	a) The conclusion drawn from this student's data is that plastic B is the most stretchable because it was the one that remained firm for the longest time.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved his procedure are, he could have specified on how many weights to add to the clamp and how heavy they should be. He could also have specified if each plastic needed to be the same length.
4313	2	3	3	After the experiment was over we concluded that plastic type B has been stretched the furthest from the weights pulling it down. Plastic type D was the second most stretched plastic then after that was plastic type C, and finally plastic type A. ^p The students didn't show how long the plastic was before stretching it. So we didn't know if all bags were the said length to start out. Another improvement could've have been telling exactly how much weight was added to the end of the bags.
4317	2	3	3	A.) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is plastic type B has more Strechability than the other ones. ^p Two ways a student could improve the experiment design could be add more trials the minimum is three, and also make sure the plastic are all the same size to begin with. Doing this could also increase the validity of the of the experiment and make it more accurate.
4323	2	3	3	a) My conclusion on this experiment is plastic type A is the stronger because it stretched the least.^p b) 2 ways that could of improved the experiment are make the plastic the same size and use the same amount of weights.
4324	2	3	3	a. Based on the data, I conclude that plastic type B Stretched the most during both trials. ^p b. Two ways the students could've improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before stretching them. Also, specify what types/size weighs because one person could put on a 1 pound weight and someone else could put on a 2 pound weight and get completely different results.
4328	2	3	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most, ending up at 22 and 23 mm, respectively.^p B) Two ways the student could've improved the design/validity of the results is including how much weight is put on the clamps, and also including the original size of plastic to begin with.
4331	2	3	3	I would say that plastic tape B has the most streachability, two ways the student could improve their designs would be to have a specific amount of weight so the expiriment is valid and they could add a third trial to make the expiriment more valid.
4335	2	3	3	A. From the data you can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the furthest. ^p B. The the could have done more experiments and they could tell how much weight so start out with.
4337	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that plastic type B had stretched the most out of the four types of polymer plastics. ^p b.) One way the students could've improved the design and/or validity of the results would be to make a third trial, seeing as some of the results were changed.  Another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use and to make sure to use the same ones.
4346	2	3	3	A) When we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights, the results read that plastic B increased the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p B) One way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics. Another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment.
4352	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable, followed by type D, followed by type C, followed by type C, followed by type A. One way the experiment could be improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of the plastic starts at the same size. Another way to improve is to perform more than 2 trials.
4355	2	3	3	"""Based upon the student's information """" by performing this experiment, plastic type B has stretched the most on average by 22.5 millimeters. Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting. The student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type, all of which should have the same amount."""
4359	2	3	3	3. a) According to the results, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These are ways the student could have made their experiment better.1) Take all plastic samples with the same length. 2) Add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial.
4362	2	3	3	a) According to the data it can be inferred that plastic B's polymer plastic stretches the most compared to the other plastics. It can also be concluded that the data is prease due to the closeness of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial.^P b.) The student could improve the experimeat by having the amount of plastic used a constant. This allows the student to have only one independent variable. (The type of plastic). They can also explain that the weights most be the same weight for plastic, so the data is not effected.
4365	2	3	3	A) I can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the most. It stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.^p B) One way this experiment could be improved is by adding more trials. Another way that this experiment could,by improved is by telling or starting how long was each plastic type before stretching it.
4367	2	3	3	a)Polyme B has the most stretchability, whilepolyme A has the least stretchability.^p (b)The students should have included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples. They also should've recorded the amount of weight they used.
4368	2	3	3	Based on the students data I concluded that Plastic type B was most stretchable and A was the least stretchy. To improve the validity at this experiment they could have included the starting length, how much the weights weighed ad also could of condicted a third or more trials.
4370	2	3	3	a) One conclusion that I determined according to the data was that plastic type B stretched the most overall in both trial 1 and 2. Another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type D, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. ^p b) One way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag.
4372	2	3	3	In T1 and T2 B stretched out the most durring the 5 minutes.^p The student could improve his experiment by doing an extra trial for a more valid result. As well the student could have stated in the experimental design the weights heavieness.
4373	2	3	3	A) Based on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type B stretched out the most compared to all the other plastic types in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials which would of made the experiment more accurate another way would be specifying how much the weight and clamp actually weighed.
4375	2	3	3	A) According to the results of the students plastic B was stretched out the most. For plastic A the results are 10 mm for T1 and 12 mm for T2. For plastic B the results are 22 mm for T1 and 23 for T2. Plastic C the results are 14 mm for T1 and 13 mm for T2. Lastly for plastic D the results are 20 mm for T1 and 20 mm for T2. B) One way the students could have improved their experiment was they could have done more trials with the different types of plastic. Another way they could have improved was to show how many weights they used and what kind of plastic they used so we could see the effect they had according to the type.
4378	2	3	3	Upon the completion of the experiment, it was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic B stretched on aver age 22 mm, while Plastic A stretched an average 11mm, plastic C stretched an average 13.5 mm, and plastic D stretched an average 20mm. Two ways that the group could have improved their experiment would be to include how big the clamp is and to include how much weight is being added to the clamp.
4380	2	3	3	A) Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design would be to state how much weight to add to the clamp, and to do 3 trials with an average instead of just two with no average.
4382	2	3	3	Based on the students trials, plastic type B was the best one because it allowed the most stretching. In its first test it scored the highest of 22mm, and then in test 2 scored 23 mm, also the highest. Plastic type B will stretch the most if weights was put on it and for 5 minutes. 6P (A) The student could have improved this lab by adding specific measurements to certain steps such as how much weight should be added in step 4. (B) The student could have also improved rethis lab by making each plastic the same length. In step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate.
4386	2	3	3	Based on the students data, Plastic Type B stretched the most. In the first trial it stretched 22 mm and in the second trail it stretched 23 mm. The second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm. The student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. Also, he/she could have stated how much weight they were using to stretch the material.
4387	2	3	3	Based on the data I can conclude they plastic B and D are the most flexible, to improve the experiment students could have cut all the samples to the same length and they could have preformed more trials.
4389	2	3	3	According to this student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchable of the types tried. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the data keeps accurately valid. The experiment design was poor. One way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, are the tight, etc. Another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials.
4391	2	3	3	In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.
4392	2	3	3	a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid.
4395	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic is worked the best for both trials with 22 mm for that I and 23mm for trial 2. Plastic D not 20mm for both trials. Plastic C with 14mm and 13mm and the least stretchy was plastic A with 10mm and 12mm. B) Two ways they could have improved was to name the polymers such as BP. They also could have said how much the clamps and the weights weighed.
4399	2	3	3	Plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p The student should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before preforming the experiment. If all the plastics are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the length or because of the type of plastic. He or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity.
4405	2	3	3	Based on the information provided from the experiment, I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability (22mm, 23m) and plastic A is the least stretchability (10mm, 12mm). Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their lab was to cut the same length of each plastic prior to testing stretchability and to specify the amount and mass at the weights to added.
4407	2	3	3	a) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most flexible and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initially be. This will improve validity as well.
4412	2	3	3	A) a conclusion of this experiment is type B stretched the most, it Stretched an average of 22.5mm, this was greater then type D with an Average of 20mmtpe C with 13.5mm and lastly A with 11mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment design/validity is specify if the same amount of weight is being added and have 3trials to make sure numbers are accurate.
4426	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh (4). Another way is to set a specific length pf plastic, not just any measure the length (1).
4429	2	3	3	a) Plastic B can stretch the longest where as Plastic A can not stretch as far. ^p  b) One way to improve the experiment would be to specify a specific number and type of weights that are being added and to keep it constant. Also, another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors, and more trials would lead to more accurate data.
4436	2	3	3	The student could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results. They could have done so, by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Having the plasics at different lengths hanging from the table will cause error. Also she could say how heavy of weights will be hanging, and for how long. All of these factors affected the experiment.
4437	2	3	3	This experiment concluded that plastic type A is the least stretchable land plastic type B the most stretchable. Plastic C is also not that stretchable and D is stretchable. One way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the weights are the same weight. Also that the original plastics are all the same length.
4439	2	3	3	Plastic type B was stretched out the most. The students could have improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. They also could have put down the length of the plastic befor they started streching.
4443	2	3	3	A) The conclusion of this experiment is that polymer B has the most stretchability, while polymer A is the least stretchable. ^p B) The students could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials to confirm the data.
4444	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the greakest amant of stretchability, surpassing the next stretchiest by 2-3 mm. ^p b) The students, in order to improve validity, must record the length of each sample prior to stretching, to observe change. Also, they should acknowledge the amount of weight used to stretch the plastics, and never change it.
4445	2	3	3	"""a) The conclusion I'd draw from the student's data would be that plastic type """"B"""" was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve his experimental design, the student could've specified how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know. To improve his results validity, he could have done more than 2 trials-the more trials he did, the more valid his results would be."""
4446	2	3	3	(a) Plastic type A stretched the least and is therefore the most durable of the 4 types. ^p (b) The students could improve the experimental design by determining a consistent starting area for all of plastics, and they could improve the validity by doing more trials.
4448	2	3	3	My conclusion to this polymer investigate is that plastics type B has the most stretchability. I think this because trial 1 and trials 2 both have the most stretchability. Some ways that the experiment could have been improved is by taking the I cader how much. The weights and clamp weighed. Another way the the experiment could he improved is by telling the reader where the clamp was placed.
4449	2	3	3	a) Plastic B was the stretched of all the polymeres. Plastic A was the strongest of all the polymers. ^P b) This person should have the exact length of the plastic. He/she also should have told the exact amount of weight to add to the clamp.
4455	2	3	3	Based on the student's data I can see that plastic type B had the Most stretchability because both trials it stretched the most. To make this more valid, the student should have used the same length to start with for each plastic. Also they should include how many weights should be added and have much each weight weighs in order to keep it constant.
4456	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B will Sstrech the most, while plastic A will strech the least. B) describe the initial lenht of each plastic, and describe the amount of weight added to the clamp.
4459	2	3	3	3.a) They found that plastic type B has the exact stretchability because it stretched more than any of the other polymers. ^p b) The could improve the validity of the experiment by doing more trials. They could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment.
4460	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretched the most at av average at 22.5 mm plastic A only stretched an average of 11mm, which is the least out of all of the plastics tested. b)  One way the students could have improved their experiment would be to say how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp. Another thing they should have done would be to beep all of the plastics taped to a table at the same height. It does not say they are all held at the same height in the procedure, so we cannot assume they were.
4461	2	3	3	Base on the student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, and type A doesn't stretch as far. ^P 2 ways the students could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results. Another way would be have the same amount of weights for each type.
4463	2	3	3	In conclusion, each one of the plastics are different types of plastic due to the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic is different due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more test trials to see if the data is perfectly correct and by making sure the amount of weights added on the claps were equal.
4465	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that the plastic that  can be stretched the most is type B, and the one which can be stretched the least is type A. The students could have improved this design by keeping or consistent sample size. Another way this experiment could have been more valid as if the weights on the plastic were also kept consistent.
4468	2	3	3	(A) A conclusion cannot be made with the amount of data given, the experiment doesn't show the starting size of each plastic same so the data given doesn't show how much each some stretched. (B) To improve this experiment the students must record, and keep constant the size of each plastic sample. Another way to improve the validity of this experiment is to record, and keep constant the amount of weight added to each of the plastic samples.
4469	2	3	3	a) As you can see in my table that plastic B was the most stretched plastic and the none least stretched was plastic A.^p B) I think the students could of told how much each weight really whey. Another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much space was the weight and plastic from each other.
4476	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the farthest.^p The student could have improved the experimental design by recording the exact weight to clamp. They also could have put the measurements of the plastic before it was stretched.
4477	2	3	3	The conclusion I can draw from the data is plastic B is the most stretchabety. The data show in trial one it stretched to 22mm and trial two it stretched 23mm while D only stretched 20mm. ^p Two way the student could improve the experiment is do more trial and tell us how much weights to put on.
4482	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most then type D, then type c, and type A streched the least. ^p b) One way they could have improved would be making the weight constant. The results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time.
