10981	5	3	3	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
10992	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
11304	5	3	3	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.
11320	5	3	3	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.
11573	5	3	3	1) tRNA reads the strand of mRNA using anticodons.2) tRNA retrieves amino acids.3) The process continues until a stop codon is reached.4) The newly formed polypeptide is released.
11635	5	3	3	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.
11682	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
11721	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.
11723	5	3	3	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
11733	5	3	3	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.
11741	5	3	3	Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
11762	5	3	3	The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.  Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.  On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.
11780	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.
11819	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins.  2. Ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made. 3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds. 4. A stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain, making a complete protein.
11830	5	3	3	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
11846	5	3	3	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.
11868	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA. Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA. The tRNA forms the complement of the mRNA strand, and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a STOP codon is reached.
11872	5	3	3	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.
11945	5	3	3	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.
11992	5	3	3	The mRNA enters the ribosome. It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA. The starting codon is always Met. As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA, the amino acids above them form peptide bonds. Finally, the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA. This signals the end of protein synthesis.
12007	5	3	3	mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.
12031	5	3	3	First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.
12033	5	3	3	During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.
12051	5	3	3	(1) When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell to a ribosome. (2)The mRNA is then read by the ribosome. (3)The ribosome matches the mRNA sequence with a complementary tRNA sequence, which then codes for a specific protein. (4)The protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes.
12123	5	3	3	1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation
12144	5	3	3	1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.
12329	5	3	3	The mRNA enters the ribosome.Start codon enters P site, second codon at A site.tRNA adds a amino acid to the codon at the P site and A site.The P site codon breaks apart and the codon at the A site takes its place and the process continues until you hit a stop codon, the chain of amino acids creates a protein.
12387	5	3	3	mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis. From the nucleus the first step includes the mRNA attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA. tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA. The third step,the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid.
12394	5	3	3	1. mRNA floats to a ribosome (rRNA) in the cytoplasm and reads three bases (codon)2. tRNA matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3. RNA moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the tRNA then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein. the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
12467	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.
12500	5	3	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome. The ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon AUG. Once it sees this codon, it starts pairing the bases with complementary anticodons on the tRNA. The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein. This process terminates at a stop codon.
12561	5	3	3	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.
12770	5	3	3	1. The mRNA arrives in the nucleus and goes through a ribosome. 2. In the ribosome the mRNA attracts a tRNA with the anticodon that matches its codon.3. The tRNA brings the amino acid that matches the codon to the ribosome and attaches it to the other amino acids in the sequence. 4. Once the last codon is matched with its amino acid the tRNA work to form a polypeptide chain that will become a certain protein in the body based on its shape.
12895	5	3	3	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes. It is a single strand, so tRNA comes with its codons that attach to the mRNA in specific ways. It first has to find AUG to start. The rRNA then attaches to the mRNA and creates the site to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create proteins. As it creates the proteins, the proteins are linked to form a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide breaks loose when it reaches a stop codon.
12906	5	3	3	The mRNA binds to the ribosome and makes tRNA which then goes and gathers amino acids then the tRNA drops the amino acids off then goes and gets more until a 'stop' condon is read then polypeptide bonds for making the protein then the protein leaves the cell.
12909	5	3	3	As mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to rRNA, or a ribosome, to be translated into a protein.  tRNA travels to the ribosome with an amino acid, it then creates a covalent bond and releases the amino acid.  As more and more of these covalent bond occur more amino acids begin to fuse together, creating a polypeptide bond.  The polypeptide then folds up and travels to the Golgi to be sent to where it is needed.
12911	5	3	3	1. The mRNA goes into a ribosome.2. The rRNA translates the code in the ribosome.3. The tRNA connects to amino acids (CG, AT).4. When the tRNA reaches a stop codon a protein is released.
13018	5	3	3	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a ribosome. At the ribosome, iniation occurs when a tRNA molecule with the anti-codon UAC binds to the codon AUG, coding for the amino acid Met and starting the synthesis of the protein. Next, elongation occurs as more tRNA molecules bind to codons and form peptide bonds in between the amino acids to build the protein. When the tRNA comes upon a Stop codon, the new protein breaks off in the process of termination and goes into the cell. Last, the ribosome completes the process by disassembly, getting ready for a new mRNA molecule.
13117	5	3	3	The process in which RNA makes proteins is called translation. During translation, the mRNA leaves the nuclues and enters the ribosomes, the part of the cell that creates proteins. The tRNA pairs its anticodon with the mRNA's codon to form and amino acid. When another amino acid is made, the two pairs form a bond to stick together, holding information to create the protein. Once the stop codon arises and the bonds are complete, the protein is assembled.
13140	5	3	3	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and connects to tRNA in the ribosome.     The tRNA then makes an anticodon that matches the codons on the mRNA.     Then the tRNA goes out and finds the amino acid that matches with the anticodon that it's carrying.     Finally the all the tRNA come back and connect the amino acids in order to create the protein.
13155	5	3	3	"""mRNA attaches to a strand of rRNA in a ribosome;tRNA codons, carrying amino-acids, attach to the rRNA according to the rRNA base sequence;the amino-acids carried by the tRNA link together with peptide bonds;a stop codon carried by the mRNA interrupts the process when the proteine is completed and allows it to leave the ribosome."""
13195	5	3	3	In protein synthesis, one major step starts when mRNA leaves the nucleus through the the nuclear pores carrying the information needed to make the proteins. It then enters a ribosome. This is because this is where proteins are made.The third thing is that the mRNA sequence pairs up into pairs of three, making amino acids. The last step is that the amino acid codes make the proteins needed.
13236	5	3	3	The mRNA travels to a ribosome. Translation occurs and tRNA attraches the anticodons to the mRNA that correspond with it. On the other end of the tRNA is the amino acid. The amino acids join together and detach from the tRNA and become a protein.
13252	5	3	3	mRNA will exit through the nucleus and travel to possible ribosomes that are nearby. tRNA will come with codons that will now attach themselves to the mRNA in a certain way. It first must seek the AUG which is the start codon. The rRNA will attach to the mRNA and create an area to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create their own proteins. As proteins are formes, they are linked to form a polypeptide chain. This breaks down loose when reaching of a stop codon occurs.
13300	5	3	3	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and then attaches to rRNA, ribosomal RNA. Once firmly attached to this ribosomal RNA, the mRNA forms codons, which are a set of three neuclotides. These codons then match with anticodons on tRNA, which also hold amino acids. The amio acids on the tRNA form peptide bonds with the other amino acids to form a chain. Once the bond between two proteins has been formed, the tRNA floats away to find another amino acid to carry. This process continues until there is a full chain of amino acids, which then creates a protein.
