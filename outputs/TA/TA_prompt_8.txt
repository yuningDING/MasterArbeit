The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center.

20094	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a great track star is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about running in college.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he could not read and flunked out of college Paul knows how Mr. Leonard felt because he could not read at the beginning of the story.  After Paul hears Mr. Leonard tell him about his reading troubles he takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him for once learn how to accomplish something.
20098	8	2	2	After Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard.  The teacher could not read when he was in high school either and did not get the best grades and he could not read.

At the end of the story he walks back to the school telling Mr. Leonard that it's time to start his training. The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out.
20101	8	2	2	Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
20102	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading.
20103	8	2	2	It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.
20109	8	2	2	The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own.
20112	8	2	2	The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.
20115	8	2	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future. Learning Mr. Leonard's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed.
20118	8	2	2	The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.
20124	8	2	2	Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running.
20125	8	2	2	Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit. He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well, what happened after that?'. Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better.
20126	8	2	2	Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20130	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great. This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals.      When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades, he would never make it in college. He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
20133	8	2	2	The background information changes Paul's view on the Mr. Leonard. He knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard read while Mr. Leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in Paul's eyes. Paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because Mr. Leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college.
20136	8	2	2	Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard. Paul started to understand how Mr. Leonard feeling about his life so Paul decided to teach him how to read. Also, Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard. He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle, he still have to study very hard. He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before.
20139	8	2	2	The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle.
20141	8	2	2	The backround information about Mr. Leonard excites Paul because Paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that Mr. Leonard has had with track in college. Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing.
20144	8	2	2	Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read. He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud. Also, he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew.
20145	8	2	2	The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him  of working harder. There are many plots that can support the point, among which one detail is predominant.  As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard.
20147	8	2	2	Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
20148	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
20149	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together.
20150	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had.
20151	8	2	2	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20152	8	2	2	He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
20156	8	2	2	Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks.
20161	8	2	2	It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems. Also they are both good hurdelers.
20163	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him.
20164	8	2	2	It has a very big effect on Paul because, Mr. Leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student, Paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well, so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week.  And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did.      Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up, but there were'nt any so he flunked.

When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed.

Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well couldn't read. Unlike Mr. Leonard, he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read. When Mr. Leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read.

So he is supprised that Mr. Leonard is such a great hurdler, and it prompts him to ask why he didn't continue that carreer.

Pauls act of saying, 'It's time to start your training' to Mr. Leonard shows the value of a true relationship.  Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him.  One kind act to another is exactly what has happened. Without any of the background information, none of this would have happened.

It drove him to try harder on reading and to help him  beacuse Mr. Leanard never got the chance to get help with reading. 'The emotions in Mr. leanard's words were all to familier to me.'
20202	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him. Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports. Mr. Leonard can't read but was a very good athlete. Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels. They both feel embarrassed because they can't read but like to do hurdles.

20210	8	2	2	When reading the article, the reader first sees Mr. Leonard as a kind of mean guy, that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool, because he is a hall monitor. Later on in the story when Mr. Leonard takes Paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that Mr.Leonard used to be a very succesful track runner, and used to be very well known. The reader also learns that he flunked out of college, and that's why he is no longer a runner.      Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well. In the process of joining the high school track team Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a very well known track star. This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.     When Paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be, and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read.          The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful.
20211	8	2	2	The background information that the Paul finds on Mr. Leonard is very emotional for him because he dicoovers the reason that Mr. Leonard is so motivated to help him. Paul has the same problem that Mr. Leonard has with reading, but the only difference is that Paul gets help for his reading and Mr. Leonard didn't. So when he sees an apportunirty to help Paul  he does and is return Paul helps Mr. Leonard in the end.
20214	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard. The effects of that background information make Paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life. This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he's at school. An example with details would be, 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Also, Mr.Leonard's background information makes Paul want to excel at something, and Paul wants to help out Mr.Leonard.
20216	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard past it shows him that he can overcome his obstacles the way that Mr. Leonard did.  Paul understands why Mr. Leonard put so much effort into him. Also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like Mr. Leonard.
20219	8	2	2	In the story paul learns that mr. leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman. I think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make Mr. Leonard in the postion that he is today. when Mr. Leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why Mr. leonard wants to train him. In  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr. Leonard with his reading.
20220	8	2	2	Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star. He was in shock when he found out tht Mr. Leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles.
20222	8	2	2	that he didnt know that he was a track star when he went to collage and then Mr. Leonard told him that he dropped out because he didnt know how to read its was the same thing for Paul because he is good at hurdles but he is only in highschool but he also does not know how to read but he is getting help and can read a little bit and is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read to.
20225	8	2	2	Paul can't read just like Mr. Leonard. Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt because he too could not read. Paul then started to train Mr. Leonard too read, because he helped Paul with something, Paul wanted to return the favor.
20228	8	2	2	During the story, the readers gets backround information about Mr. Leonard. The backround information effected Paul because they both had things in common. They both couldn't read well. The response with details from the story include: The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
20230	8	2	2	paul is supriszed that mr. leonard failed his collage classes, and at the end he makes the effert to help mr. leonard to read
20232	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard use to be a big track star. He was amd excelent athlete but just like Paul, he struggled with learning and reading. He kept the information about his past away from Paul because he was extremely embarassed about him failing, and flunking out of college.          When Paul found out about Mr. Leonards accomplishments, he was confused as to why he never said anything to him. Then Mr. Leonard explained to him about how he was never a very good student but colleges didn't care because he was such a greath athlete. When Paul is told that he was a awful reader also, he felt compelled to ivite Mr. Leonard to his learning center.
20234	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles he was surprised. When he seen Mr. Leonard the next day at practice he asked why he did not tell Paul about his award and record breaking college life. Mr Leonard responded with, ' Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn'y matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder then high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No nother school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So in the end Paul had realized Mr. Leonard had changed his life so it was time to change his. Paul took him to class and said, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
20235	8	2	2	I think it gives Paul some encourgement knowing that he was taught and trained by a national winner in track. It alos opens up a few connections he as with Mr. leonard about being able to talk about track instead of just the learnign center.Mr. Leonard is a role model of Paul
20237	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard affects Paul by making him want to help Mr. Leonard with reading like he had helped Paul with running.  Paul had experienced some of the same things that Mr. Leonard described from college.
20240	8	2	2	He felt connected to him because he knew how it felt to be embarrased about not being able to read well. He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him.
20242	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is both a track star and a poor reader. They display some of the same traits. Paul is empathetic towards Mr. Leonard and vice-versa because of their similarites. Paul even suggests he can relate to Mr. Leonard's embarrassment of not finishing college. Mr. Leonard saw the same characteristics in Paul that he saw in himself, and helped him to excell at something. In the same way, Paul wishes to assist Mr. Leonard to achieve something.
20245	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard, Paul feels empathetic for him. The background information makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard because he feels the same way. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew. '
20246	8	2	2	What Paul had found out, I think helped him to persue in his learning and to help him be good in the hurdles. I think that Paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get. Paul saw Mr. Leonard as a great athlete who didn't have the good grades to finish the total package. I think that Paul will learn that you have to be smart and have an education and then the rest will come later.
20251	8	2	2	Paul was concerned about why Mr. Leonard never told him about this. Mr. Leonard told his story and explained why he it made him sad and how he dropped out of college for poor grades and became a hall monitor. Paul related to how he felt, being part of a select few not knowing how to read. Paul responds by offering Mr. Leonard 'training'.
20252	8	2	2	Paul couldn't believe the details about Mr. Leonard's past and wonders why Mr. Leonard never shared this with him. Mr. Leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not isn't very studious. Mr. Leonard couldn't read, so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it. This is similiar to Paul's situation. They both are good hurdlers, they couldn't read, and they felt embarrassed about it. So once Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard can't read, he wants to train him to read just like Mr. Leonard trained Paul to be a good hurdler.
20253	8	2	2	The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' And Mr. Leonard tells him about being a star athlete 'but not a good student.' And explains that he couldn't read just like Paul.And I think Paul could relate to that and apply it to his own situation.
20255	8	2	2	When the narrator gets background information about Mr. Leonard he learns that Mr. Leonard was a very talented track star. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was willing to help him to keep improving at track, because Mr. Leonard wanted the narrator to succeed. Mr. Leonard wamted the narrator to succeed because of what happened to himself.
20259	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard inspires Paul to not only practice track, but excel in his schoolwork also. It even inspires Paul to start to teach Mr. Leonard how to read. As we see when he says 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' 'It's time to start your training.'
20260	8	2	2	I believe it makes paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard is. It helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and encouraging him to do his best at the hurdles. he also realizes that those two are very much the same, because they both aren't good at reading
20261	8	2	2	When paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard this effects Paul in a good way. Paul now understands why Mr.Leonard wanted to help Paul be on the track team. Paul undersands now why Mr. Leonard pushed him to reach his goal. Paul understood why he didnt remember his name from the past because he found out that Mr. Leonard was  a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records, but he also realized the Mr. Leonard didnt know how to read just like him. He found out that Mr.Leonard wanted him to have a reason to learn how to read and to take advantage of the reading center so Paul could learn how to read because Mr. Leonard didnt have the oppurtunity.
20262	8	2	2	The background information influences Paul to push himself. He says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. ... This man had given me his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' This also wants Paul to do something nice and helpful for Mr. Leonard, he says, 'It's time to start your training.', meaning he wants to help him learn how to read.
20263	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college. The reason being he couldn't read Paul saw a little of himslef in him and told him that he will teach him how to read since he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20265	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard won nationals in the 400 meter hurtles as a freshman, he is immediately inspired.  Paul realizes that he is being coached by an expert.  Then, Paul finds out that the reason Mr. Leonard stopped running track was because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  This was exactly like Paul, which is why Paul helps Mr. Leonard with reading at the end of the story.
20269	8	2	2	In the story, Mr. Leonard helps Paul become a good athlete after learning that he can't read. Paul works hard and deserves his spot to work with the high school team. The coach gives Paul a website to look at. On the website he sees someone he has grown close to.     Mr. Leonard was a track star. He went to college on a scholoarship and broke many school records. As college life caught up with him, he realized that he couldn't do it. He didn't know how to read. As time went on, he failed out.             Paul can see himself through Mr. Leonard. He sees that he cannot read, just like Mr. Leonard. He sees that he has become quite the athlete, just like Mr. Leonard. He wants to try to do something for himself because of the affect Mr. Leonard had an on him. He worked with Mr. Leonard and never gave up on him just like he was not given up on.           This story can relate to many people. We need to work at things we think we can't do. With a little training, we can do whatever. Paul was more than happy to help his new freind. He wanted to show him that he would reach out to him in the same way Mr. Leonard reached out. He would help him overcome his obstacles.

20276	8	2	2	When Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he was surprized because he didnt know that Mr. Leonard had went to college and won the 4oo meter dash. So Paul asked him 'What happened after that?', and Mr. Leonard told him and you could tell of the sad emotions in his voice of being a good athlete but, not having the good grades to continue on the track team even when your freinds are trying to help you and its all because you dont how to read.      When Paul thought about that and it occured to him that Mr. Leonard had taken the time to help him excel at track he know what to and he said 'come on Mr. Leonard its time to start your training.'

Paul felt the same way about hiself, he to feels embarrassed because he cant read something as good as other people. Paul decides that Mr. Leonard helped him excel at something and that it was time to return the favor, by taking him to the learning center.
20497	8	2	2	Finding out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read made Paul want to help him learn just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at jumping hurdles in track.
20498	8	2	2	When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past track excellence, he becomes inquisitive, then empithetic.  Paul's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online.  His continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in '`But you went to college,'' and 'I pressed'.' Paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard how to read and when Paul states ' The emotions in Mr. Leonards voice were all to familiar to [Paul].'  When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard, his natural curiosity turns to empathy.
20500	8	2	2	When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was, that inspires Paul. Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years. Mr. Leonard accomplish much, by setting national records and being one of the best runner. This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read.
20501	8	2	2	The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself. He felt the embarrisment When he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new. It all reminded him of Mr. Leanard who was a track star that flunked out of college because he could not read.     Paul then deliberates that because Leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read.
20503	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a trackstar in college. Paul soon realized that Mr. Leonard was a superb athlete, but was not the best student. Mr. Leonard tells Paul he flunked out of college. Knowing this, Paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously.
20504	8	2	2	The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways. It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better. He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles. This is, in a way, his repayment to Mr. Leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more. The background information helped the Paul understand more about Mr. Leonard, while at the same time, it helped the reader understand the motives behind what Mr. Leonard did.
20505	8	2	2	When Paul goes to the track coach, the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski.'  Paul follows directions and finds out about Mr. Leonard's past.  The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college.  When Paul asks Mr. Leonard about this, Mr. Leonard comences to tell Paul that he was a fantastic runner, but a less than average student.  Paul takes this information as an encouragement.  It encourages him to excel in both school and sports.  Mr. Leonard's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read.
20507	8	2	2	The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Also, seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles. This is the effect which Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
20509	8	2	2	The information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard is that he couldn't read in school either, but he broke records. Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how good of an athlete he was. Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Paul knew that Mr. Leonard was probably embrassed because he couldn't read and Paul knew how it felt.
20512	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard has helped Paul building his skill as a hurdler and Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
20515	8	2	2	After Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is curious and surprised. Paul learned of his achievements and wondered why he didn't continue to do track after he won the nationals. It was hard for Paul to understand why so much talent went to waste until he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't able to read. Paul felt closer to Mr. Leonard because they had the same emotions.
20516	8	2	2	The background informations effect on Paul is that it inspires him. He sees how even though Mr. Leonard couldn't read that he still excelled past people in something else. Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard and Paul wants to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard.
20519	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets makes him see that he was not the only one that couldn't read. He is touched by the fact that Mr. Leonard took his time to coach him into being better. He wants to do something nice for Mr. Leonard just like he did for him.
20532	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul feels like he can relate to this. Paul says, after learning how Mr. Leonard funked out of college because he could not read, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment...' (45). This describes the situation Paul is going through right now and it provides a stronger connection between the two characters.
20539	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a star track and field athlete in college he becomes confused as to why Mr. Leonard kept it from him. Mr. Leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college. Paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school. Realizing that Mr. Leonard had helped Paul excel at something, Paul decided to start 'training' Mr. Leonard how to read.
20543	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college, which seems to inspire him. He wanted to know about his experience and as Mr. Leonard told him about it, Paul began to realize that he and Mr. Leonard were pretty similar. Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run and do hurdles, and Paul wanted to help teach Mr. Leonard something.
20547	8	2	2	Paul was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either . Paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website . It made Paul want to try harder to learn to read so he could give something back to Mr. Leonard .
20559	8	2	2	Though just a lowly hall monitor, Mr. Leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star. When Paul discovers this, he wonders what went wrong in his life to pull him away from a life of success into being a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard then tells about how he couldn't read, just like Paul. It affects Paul in two ways. First, it makes him realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to start running; because he saw himself in Paul. Second, it made Paul realize that they had alot in common as well, and made him want to persevere.
20561	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul is having trouble in school. Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports. The hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling. Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds. His coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, and broke records. The problem was, Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing: he couldn't read very well either. Just like Paul, school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him. Paul was moved by this, and decided to get Mr. Leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream.
20564	8	2	2	The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard.      Paul struggled reading, and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track. When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, even after being a big track star, ''the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'' Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling. It is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since Mr. Leonard gave his time up to help Paul excel at hurdles, he was going to help Mr. Leonard at reading.
20565	8	2	2	Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college. He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades.
20571	8	2	2	The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school. Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem.
20577	8	2	2	He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.
20579	8	2	2	The background information has a significant effect on Paul.  When Paul first learns from his coach that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete, he goes and asked about what happened.  Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could not read and fluncked out of college, which Paul himself could relate to.  In the end they both bettered the other and a way.
20580	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he is shocked at first. Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete. However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read.
20582	8	2	2	The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder. Also, it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard. For example, at the end when he says 'C'mon , Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger.
20583	8	2	2	It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.
20586	8	2	2	The effect on the backround information on Paul seemed like they  made them very similair in a way.  Mr. Leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read. Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read. There is a connection between them.     When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read. Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better.     The backround information that Paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that Mr. Leonard just wanted to help Paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful.
20588	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't mention the fact that he was a college track star. Paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he was embarrassed that he flunked out, but in the end it showed Paul why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him.
20590	8	2	2	The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.
20596	8	2	2	I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation.  Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles.  Even though Paul was good at jumping hurdles, he felt as though he wasn't good enough.  When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.  He wanted to try to get better at hurdles, but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like Mr. Leonard.  Paul even decided that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve something, he was going to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
20600	8	2	2	During the story, Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard. Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school's track coach. The track coach had told him to visit a website, so Paul did and found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could not read, he took it upon himself to repay Mr. Leonard for what he had done for him.
20601	8	2	2	Paul is encouraged. After training and learning that Mr. Leonard also could not read, he was encouraged to teach Mr. Leonard to read while Paul himself was being coached. Mr. Leonard knew what Paul was going through which is a reason he had Paul start hurdleing in the first place, and when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had been in the same boat that Paul was in it made him look at life in a new way.
20605	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard's past and is surprised. When Paul asks 'what happened after that?', he is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out, all because he had a difficult time reading. This enourages Paul to work hard, and makes him want to help Mr. Leonard the way Mr. Leonard helped him.
20607	8	2	2	Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1. They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them. Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46.
20609	8	2	2	Paul feels motivated to work harder at track because he has good grades and he can read which is something Mr. Leonard never had. Paul, also, is sympathetic for Mr. Leonard and he tells Mr. Leonard it's time for his training as they walk back to the school. Paul is implying he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20615	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
20616	8	2	2	He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm.
20617	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he couldn't get very far in his life. So the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals.
20625	8	2	2	I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records. He asked questions about it and seemed very interested.
20628	8	2	2	The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read.
20635	8	2	2	Paul knows what its like to not be able to read. So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him.
20638	8	2	2	He ws shocked at first because he didn't think that Mr.Leonard could've ben a track star. But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldn't read. He is also inspired to help Mr.Leonard with reading because he had helped Paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back.
20639	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul somewhat confused at first, because he does not know why he would hide his past of being a track star. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul the whole story, Paul is empathetic with Mr. Leonard's situation because he is in a similar situation, and decides to help him with his past.
20640	8	2	2	Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school.
20641	8	2	2	Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster. Paul says in the passage, 'It's time to start your training.' this is a way that paul can help Mr. leonard on his reading and to repay him for what he done for him. the background information helps paul realize that not everyone is the same, and that he isn't the only person that can't read. Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence.
20642	8	2	2	When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades.
20645	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL, and Paul looks him up, he realizes something important. Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common. They both struggled with reading. Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals, and he took that opportunity.     Obviously, when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul, he saw himself as a child. He remembered what it was like to be in his position. So, Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help. Paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams, and he is unable to read, doesn't mean he is unable to do other important things. Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams.
20647	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised. Paul first wants to know why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about it. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul knows exactly what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through the same thing. Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he can't read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.' Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him.
20649	8	2	2	While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard wasn't the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades.      As Mr. Leonard is telling Paul about his past Paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. Paul is in a similar situation as Mr. Leonard; however Paul recieves helps from the school's reading center. Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him.
20652	8	2	2	It suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic.  In the last paragraph, paul wants Mr. Leonard to start training.  Paul also is a little confused on how Mr. Leonard didnt make it as a runner.  In paragraph 43, paul mentions that Mr. Leonard went to colleage.
20655	8	2	2	The background information presented about Mr. Leonard is effective in the fact that Paul can realize his own true potential.      In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out.
20659	8	2	2	Paul was suprized at what Mr Leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out.
20662	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college, that he even broke records. Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too can't read.
20664	8	2	2	When Paul is told to look up Mr. Leonard, he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  Paul sees that he's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read.  Mr. Leonard is very supportive and Paul is no longer embarrased about his situation.
20666	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence. This helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for Mr. Leonard, and have Mr. Leonard work hard for him.
20668	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports.
20670	8	2	2	Paul is surprised to learn that Mr. Leonard was a star in college in hurdling and that he had won 400 titles.It makes Paul compare himself to Leonard since they were having the same kind of problems in life.It makes Paul want to struggle hard and believe he can achieve much in life despite the fact that he was not good academically.
20674	8	2	2	When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college, but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student, Paul started to relate to Mr. Leornard. He felt like they had the same flaws and problems. Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people.
20678	8	2	2	At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school. Then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking Mr. Leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like Paul. It gives Paul a whole new perspective on Mr. Leonard because he then understands that the reason Mr. Leonard is helping him is that he was just like Paul at that age and he can relate to him.
20682	8	2	2	The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20684	8	2	2	The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
20685	8	2	2	The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.
20686	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
20689	8	2	2	When Paul reads background information on Mr. Leonard, he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place.
20692	8	2	2	When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.
20697	8	2	2	Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete, but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades. Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. Paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete.
20704	8	2	2	Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become.
20708	8	2	2	Paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about Mr. Leonard. It also encourages Paul to good in track and in school now, because he has seen what happened to Mr. Leonard by not being able to read.
20714	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
20718	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20719	8	2	2	When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul. This made Paul think that Mr. Leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'C'mon, it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'.

20751	8	2	2	Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team.

His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20759	8	2	2	Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background.

It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.

Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20807	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center. Mr. Leonard's school had not had a learning center, so he never got help with his reading problems. He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems. This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring.
20808	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
20810	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life.

20821	8	2	2	The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles.

20822	8	2	2	Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school. Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.

Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track

Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20834	8	2	2	Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read. Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read.
20836	8	2	2	The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
20838	8	2	2	Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.      When Paul soon discovered that Mr. Leonard can't read and flunked out of college, he is motivated to begin Mr. Leonard's 'training.'
20841	8	2	2	It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
20842	8	2	2	Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
20846	8	2	2	Paul was suprized that Mr.Leonard never told him about his past,'Why didn't you tell me about this?' He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records.'
20850	8	2	2	Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself.
20852	8	2	2	After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments. This is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations. You broke records.'
20858	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete.

20859	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20860	8	2	2	Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star. This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him. He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself. This made Paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all, because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read.
20862	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
20863	8	2	2	Paul is affected in that learing Mr. Leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in. This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles.
20864	8	2	2	An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
20865	8	2	2	Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
20868	8	2	2	I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner.

Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20872	8	2	2	The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
20874	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
20875	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication.
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20880	8	2	2	When he learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, Paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told. He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul. He then feels like Mr. Leonard is a kindred spirit when he says 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' He feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and that makes Paul want to help him at the end of the story.
20881	8	2	2	At first,he admires Mr.Leonard. He saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it. When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard can't read, he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as Mr. Leonard helped Paul with the hurldes.
20883	8	2	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do. Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges. In the end, Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
20885	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
20893	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
20894	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20896	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.
20899	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. The effect the background information has on Paul, encourages Paul to continue to practice track and field, and to try his hardest in school. Aftering hearing about Mr. Leonard's experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, and who had broke records, and asking what had happened effected Paul the most. Also after hearing that Mr. Leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school, it encouraged Paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class, so that he could be a track allstar some day in college, but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college.
20906	8	2	2	When paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to college on a track schollarship but then failed out because he too could not read, connects Paul to his coach more. Paul realizes that he is not the only one who struggles with something and that he can accomplish great things. In paragraph 45 Paul explains how he knows and understands how his coach felt, he now knows what he can do to help his coach as well.
20908	8	2	2	The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting. He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete. He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals. You broke records.'
20909	8	2	2	The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways.
20911	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul. Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't continue in track and field after that race. He finds that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped Paul how to run hurdles.
20912	8	2	2	The reader has a normal life with no extra activities and Mr. leonard chanes that by teaching him how to hurdle. When the reader finds out why Mr. Leonard left college is when he actually connects with Mr. Leonard and wants train him in reading
20916	8	2	2	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20917	8	2	2	Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
20922	8	2	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20923	8	2	2	Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
20924	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
20926	8	2	2	During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20928	8	2	2	the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20933	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read. But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt. So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
20934	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard run track in college and boke some records he realizes how he know so much about track and understands why he is helping him once he is told about how he flunked out of college.Paul relize that he can help Mr. Leonard to so he returns the favor and helps him with what he struggled with in school.
20935	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20936	8	2	2	Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.  He  also realized they were similar.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul train for hurtles and Paul decided he could give something in return by teaching Mr. Leonard to read.
20939	8	2	2	I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
20941	8	2	2	The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard; sympathy. They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarassment when I ws called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul helped Mr. Leonard, just like he had helped Paul.
20942	8	2	2	The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
20947	8	2	2	'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another.
20948	8	2	2	he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this. mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read, bc they didnt have help centers.
20954	8	2	2	The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles.
20956	8	2	2	After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him. Paul saw that Mr. Leonard was sad, and a little regretful, about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him. Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul, and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension.
20957	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.
20960	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard.
20961	8	2	2	From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer.
20964	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in. He is unable to read but is a good at running track. It effects paul by making him want to help Mr. Leonard to read which is at the end of the story.
20965	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
20967	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20970	8	2	2	Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.
20971	8	2	2	After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read.
20972	8	2	2	It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
20977	8	2	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. but he was a really good athlete. He had lost his scholarship though, because he couldn't read.     Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20979	8	2	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20980	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read, he understands Mr. Leonard's feelings about flunking out of college. Paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho Mr. Leonard sees his pass every day. It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul so much, he wanted to return the favor and invited Mr. Leonard to his study group.
20981	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20984	8	2	2	At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage. But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading. Paul felt sympathic. And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better.
20987	8	2	2	Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
20988	8	2	2	After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
20992	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he doesn't get discouraged. Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. In paragragp forty-five, Paul states that he understands the emotions that Mr. Leonard felt, and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story.
20994	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him. Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two. He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also. We know this because at the end of the story, the narrorator says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
20995	8	2	2	Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation. When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be, Paul was filled with unbelief. Until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school, Paul knew those feelings, and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make Mr. Leonhard proud.
21000	8	2	2	Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
21005	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a staggering effect on Paul.  Paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime.  His first actions are to inquire about his coach's former accomplishments.
21006	8	2	2	I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.
21007	8	2	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
21010	8	2	2	The background infromation the Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the Mr. Leonard was just like him as a kid. It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too.
21017	8	2	2	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has a huge effect on Paul because he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul. Mr. Leonard also does not know how to read, and that is what Paul has troubles with and is trying to fix. The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have.
21023	8	2	2	In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life.
21024	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading.
21029	8	2	2	Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21030	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he isn't anymore. When Mr. Leonard tells him that he flunked out of his scholarship, Paul is very empathetic to him because he knows how Mr. Leonard feels. When Paul finds out about all of this, he wants to help Mr. Leonard.
21035	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he becomes sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard's reading difficulties, which Paul also has. This sympathy is expressed when Paul tells Mr. Leonard that: 'It's time to start [his] training.' This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems.
21036	8	2	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.  Now that Paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well, and also find something he likes and excel in that, like the hurdles and track.
21040	8	2	2	In 'Gifts' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard.  Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an award winning track star at his college, but flunked out and lost his scholarship when he had a difficult time reading.  Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard.  Paul then feels motivated to 'train' Mr. Leonard in reading.
21043	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul puzzled.  Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.  When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, Paul understood why he kept it a secret.
21044	8	2	2	The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation.  Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.
21047	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was illeterate, he understands that he should help him read, just as Mr. Leonard was helping him in track. This is implied in paragraph 46, when the narrator tells Mr. Leonard it is time for his 'training,' which means the narrator will help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21048	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul. The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard, although not able to read, was successful at other things including track. By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more accepted and normal.
21051	8	2	2	The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21056	8	2	2	Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard's troubles. Like Paul, Mr. Leonard was poor in school. Paul feels closer to him, saying that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings and words 'were all too familiar'. He realizes then that Mr. Leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help Mr. Leonard excel in something, too.
21058	8	2	2	The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
21060	8	2	2	Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track. He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before. Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had never said anything before, and Leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past. It turns out Mr. Leonard wasn't a good reader either, and flunked out of college. Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.  Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
21061	8	2	2	the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up. Paul didn understand why he quiet. but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read. Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes. but college was alot harder and Leonard could not keep up with the school work , so he flunked out. So paul decided to help Leonard to learn how to read, like Loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical.
21063	8	2	2	When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.
21066	8	2	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21077	8	2	2	Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner, but not so good at reading. It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder.
21087	8	2	2	Paul is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman. Then, he found out that he had flunked out of college, because he couldn't read. So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard.
21088	8	2	2	In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21093	8	2	2	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself.
21098	8	2	2	Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21108	8	2	2	The background infromation that Paul, the narrator, gets in this story is Mr. Leonard was an all-star track runner in high school.  He broke records and got scholarships.  Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading, like himself.  Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.     Paul knew what it was like for  Mr.Leonard becaue Paul could not read well, nor could he comprihend things easily.
21110	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star.  He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard.
21112	8	2	2	It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21119	8	2	2	When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read.
21122	8	2	2	Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.
21124	8	2	2	When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard, he is a bit confused. When Mr. Leonard explains fully however, Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding. The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional. Then, inspired by how Mr. Leonard helped him, despite the troubles he had had himself, Paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out Mr. Leonard.
21128	8	2	2	It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21131	8	2	2	From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles.
21135	8	2	2	When Paul prints out that paper on Mr. Leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Just like Paul couldn't.  Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college. Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21138	8	2	2	Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21141	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21152	8	2	2	The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul. He wanted to why Mr.Leonard wouldn't tell him about about Mr.Leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school. When Paul meets up with Mr.Leonard he asks him, ' Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21157	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
21158	8	2	2	It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21161	8	2	2	after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21172	8	2	2	The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
21184	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that him and Mr. Leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read. Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read.
21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21187	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track.
21188	8	2	2	Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at.
21190	8	2	2	The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.
21192	8	2	2	The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin.
21194	8	2	2	The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.
21201	8	2	2	Paul is confused and somewhat angry. 'why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment. Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'
21205	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself. And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend.
21208	8	2	2	The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete. Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades. Mr. Leonard inspired Paul because they are very similar, Paul was bad at school also and Paul is also a great athlete. It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed.
21209	8	2	2	Paul is shocked when he finds out who Mr. Leonard realy is.  Then when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard cant read either he has remorse for him.  Paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21212	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul was that he became motivated for something he had never done before. He had felt like he had something in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now. Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either.
21217	8	2	2	Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents. He feels very empathetic for Mr. Leonard when he learns he can't read because Paul has the same problem. Paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud, for this reason he feels for Mr. Leonard.
21218	8	2	2	When paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery. When Paul saw Mr. Leonard the next day Paul asked him about the printout that Paul had printed out the night before then Mr. Leonard explain the first parts of his track career. The Paul asked him what else happened and Mr. Leonard explain that he copied off his friends in highschool and didn't do hardly any of the work but once he got the collage he didn't know what to do so therefore he lost his scholarship and flunked out of collage.
21220	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him in school; Couldnt read. Paul was all too familiar with the words Mr. Leonard had said. Mr. Leonard had flunked out of school, and lost his scholarship. Paul is willing to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read, and Mr.Leonard is willing to help Paul get a scholarship.
21224	8	2	2	paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him .
21225	8	2	2	Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read, and Paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach Mr. Leonard how read since he helped Paul in excelling at hurdling.
21227	8	2	2	Paul was impressed by Mr. Leonard's record as a college track star which is evident by Paul's interest and impressed tone when he confronted Mr. Leonard.  When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability, Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard's emotions of embarrassment.  The challenge and talent that Mr. Leonard had in common with Paul inspired Paul to return Mr. Leonard's generosity with his time, so Paul will likely teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21229	8	2	2	The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age. They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners. Paul learns that Mr.leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship. This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader.
21233	8	2	2	Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a track star, but he flunked out because he made bad grades. It makes Paul think that he is not alone. Paul really wants to try now to read and teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21235	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21240	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21242	8	2	2	The background information surprises Paul because this man was helping him at a highschool instead of running for a team himself.  He did not expect the man to be famous. He also learns how Mr. Leonard's lack of ability to read had limited him and inspires him to keep trying.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21248	8	2	2	Paul knows that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too. He knows he's not the only person that can't read. If you can achieve a goal you can do anything.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21251	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar. Mr. Leonard didn't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading. Paul was already getting help with his grades and reading before Mr. Leonard started training him for track and field. Mr. Leonard didn't have help with his grades. He is helping Paul become the athlete that Mr. Leonard used to be. Paul and Mr. Leonard have had very similar childhoods.
21252	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a hurdler in college, and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. When he asks Mr. Leonard, 'What happened after that?' Mr. Leonard explains that he couldn't read, and that he flunked out of college. It reminded Paul of the feelings of embarassment when he didn't know an answer that everyone else did, or when he was call upon to read out loud.
21254	8	2	2	When Pual finds out about Mr. Leonard flunking out of college because he can't read, He feels sympothy and he knows how Mr. Leonard feels. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. I knew them well - feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' (Paul, P 45.)
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21256	8	2	2	This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out. Before knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him. Paul also makes another realization when he finds out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did.
21260	8	2	2	This effected Paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read. Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading.  Once Paul knew Leonard couldn't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul. Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school.
21261	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard, is similar to Paul's own life. Paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center, and then when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college, that effect gave them simularities. The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21272	8	2	2	He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read.
21275	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
21276	8	2	2	The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.  Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading.  The fact of how Mr. Leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made Paul feel a connection of similar problems.  That's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done.  Plus this makes Paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like Mr. Leonard.
21277	8	2	2	The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him. He knew what it felt like to not be able to read, to feel embarrarssed about being called and not knowing an answer everyone knew. The information he found inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read the way Mr. Leonard trained him to for jumping hurdles on the track team.
21280	8	2	2	When paul gets the infornmation of mr.leonard from the URL paul is quite amzed that mr.leonard was an amzing track athlete. mr. leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter. that is until mr. leonard confeces that he cannot read, after that moment paul tells mr.leonard that it is his time to learn.
21281	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
21283	8	2	2	It gave Paul hope that some day he would be able to read. It also helped paul understand that Mr. Leonard could not read, so he would help be able to read.
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21285	8	2	2	That Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldn't read. So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways.
21286	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles. Paul later found out that Mr. Leonard was flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read. Paul related to this because he himself doesn't know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that Mr. Leonard had. Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read.
21287	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track.
21288	8	2	2	The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
21293	8	2	2	When Paul reads about Mr. Leonards life at college, he realizes that he and Mr. Leonard are the same. And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had. He connects with him, and feels sorry for him. So Paul then helps coach Mr. Leonard in reading, which is a lesson Mr. Leonard has yet to learn.
21294	8	2	2	During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. It caused some effect on Paul once he knew.     Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.     It had an effect on Paul because Paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then Paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21305	8	2	2	Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21306	8	2	2	Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard. The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard. He asked him about it. Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had. Even though he felt embarrassed by the past. He still answered Paul.     After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past. He felt familiar with the feelings. Paul felt inspired. He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him. So, Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul.
21311	8	2	2	Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels. He has felt the same way before and still does in school. In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way. Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school. This makes Pual want to help himself and Mr. Leonard by putting Mr. Leonard through a different type of training, reading.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21322	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard's track records.  Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard was once a wonderful track star, and he is now helping Paul become better.  The background information that has the greatest effect on Paul is that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem, just like him.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul to become better at hurdles, now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard become better at reading.
21323	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21326	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
21327	8	2	2	The background information he recieves from his track coach to research about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a whole new way to look at Mr. Leonard. Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals. He discovered he broke records, and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life. The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him. This is so by Mr. Leonard also not being able to read like Paul, although they didn't have service learning centers back then. Therefore, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading.
21328	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21329	8	2	2	One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333	8	2	2	Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21337	8	2	2	The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338	8	2	2	Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21339	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21345	8	2	2	When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
21349	8	2	2	I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21355	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21358	8	2	2	Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
21362	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college.
21363	8	2	2	Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21377	8	2	2	Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21387	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete.
21390	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.
21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21396	8	2	2	In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
21397	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21398	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21403	8	2	2	Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too.
21406	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21412	8	2	2	The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
21414	8	2	2	When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
21420	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard to become a better reader, just like Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21426	8	2	2	paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21430	8	2	2	That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do.
21432	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles. But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't do well in school. So Paul can kind of relate to this. I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too.
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21435	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
21440	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21443	8	2	2	The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read.
21444	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.
21445	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star. Once he finds this out, he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him.
21446	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner. Paul also finds out about Mr. Leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as Mr. Leonard helped Paul in his weakness for track.
21448	8	2	2	Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
21449	8	2	2	When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
21453	8	2	2	The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
21454	8	2	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
21458	8	2	2	The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21461	8	2	2	I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
21462	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
21464	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard. He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought. In the beginning of the story Paul thought Leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes. By the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common, as in they both have trouble in school (reading), and they are both good at hurdles. I think Leonard became an inspiration for Paul to try to succeed, and do better than what Leonard did.
21466	8	2	2	After realizing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him.  He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him.  When he tells Mr. Leonard that it was time for his training, he was going to try and teach him how to read better.  It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy.
21468	8	2	2	Paul knows how he feels, and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff.  Now that Paul knows Mr. Leonard's history, Paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read.
21470	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
21474	8	2	2	Paul was astonished of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments, saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because Paul couldnt either, the difference was the Paul had a tutor and back then Mr. Leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out.
21485	8	2	2	Paul is shocked by the news, he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard. He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked. Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read, and that he was in college. Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him.
21486	8	2	2	It helps him realize that not only was his trainer a track star, but that because he couldn't read, he ended up flunking out of college. It also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard.
21488	8	2	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he seems to be shocked to find out how well Mr. Leonard was in his college past. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
21490	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself. Paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help. Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship. this showed Paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do.
21494	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read, Paul feels sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard. The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills. At the end of the story Paul foreshadows that he will help Mr. Leonard with his 'training' or academics.
21498	8	2	2	Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school. When Mr. leonard told Paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read I think Paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help Mr. Lenard how to read.
21499	8	2	2	It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading. And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center.
21503	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
21505	8	2	2	I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
21506	8	2	2	Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard, because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class, and it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21508	8	2	2	Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21529	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
21530	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
21531	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded.  Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track.
21532	8	2	2	Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success.
21541	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
21546	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life.
21551	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's background, he instantly begins to look up to him.  In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star.  Later in the story, in paragrah 44, Mr. Leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well.  This was something that Paul could relate to.  He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles.
21553	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21558	8	2	2	Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either. So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him.
21562	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got about Mr.Leonard effected him because he wanted to help him learn to read just like the learning center is helping Paul learn to read. Paul wanted to help out Mr.Leonard because he was like him he could not read but was a good athlete, and Paul didn't want to end up like him and he grew close to Mr.Leonard so he wanted to help him.
21568	8	2	2	The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard. They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track. Paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change, and because of this Paul grows to like Mr. Leonard even more.
21583	8	2	2	The informatioin that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is about his past career as a college track star. This information shocks Paul and makes him curious as to why Mr. Leonard didnt say anything to him about his acheivements. It also makes Paul look up to Mr. Leonard.
21584	8	2	2	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it. When Mr. Leonard tells him about not being able to read and that he flunked out of high school, Paul knew how he felt. Now Paul wants to keep running, and help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21587	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked. Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common. They are both very good at track and neither of them can read. Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track.
21588	8	2	2	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about being so good at track, that is after all something a person should be proud of. Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
21590	8	2	2	Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard when he discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read and that he flunked out of college because of that. Paul then realizes that he can train Mr. Leonard in reading just as he had been training Paul in track and field.
21592	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr.  Leonard was a great athlete who couldn't make the grades to perform in college, and relates that to his personal situation. In the story, Paul showed Mr. Leonard a picture of him running in college, and tells Mr. Leonard that he knows he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.
21595	8	2	2	The background information had a major effect on Paul. Paul now understood more things about his coach. Such as why, out of all people he choose Paul to work with. The reason comes from the article where Paul first meets Mr. Leonard when he is in the hall going to the Learning center and this is when Mr. Leonard compared himself to Paul and saw something in him beginning their relationship. Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit.
21596	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a former track star, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had not told him earlier.  When Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could not ready, just like him, he felt like they had a lot more in common with each other.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well --feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  This shows that Paul is very apreciative that Mr. Leonard is showing interest in him, and it motivates him to do well in school so that he can succeed in college.
21599	8	2	2	I think the infomation he got about Mr. Leonard made Paul realize that he can be normal and still be successful with his readling problem. Mr. Leonard doesn't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles. While Paul is gonna help Mr. Leonard read. They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back.
21600	8	2	2	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in many ways. Mr. Leonard sees a lot of himself in Paul and that reminds him of how he used to be. Mr. Leonard is looking out for Paul because he doesn't want the same thing to happen to Paul that he went through. He believes that Paul can do domething great. For example, after Mr. Leonard asked Paul where he was going and why, that's when he got the idea of asking him to play sports. Then he realized basketball wasn't what he liked, so he gave him a chance on the hurdles and Paul succeeded.
21601	8	2	2	In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard. Telling us that he can't read, such as Paul can't read. By that occuring to him that hurt Mr. Leonard's life becuase he flunked out of college and it ruined his life. Mr. Leonard is helping Paul so that history won't repeat itself and so Paul won't end up like him.
21602	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards background he sees himself because they are similiar in the way that they both are runners and they both can't read. Since Paul learns about Mr. Leonards background he is motivated to do better than Mr. Leonard and graduate from college.
21605	8	2	2	When Paul finds that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college he is amazed that he was helping him out and wanted to know why he had not said anything before this. He wanted to know why he did not succeed in a professional level, or do anything after college. When he finds out that he had a hard time reading, Paul decides to return the favor Mr. Leonard had done for him and help him with his reading skills.
21614	8	2	2	The background information that Paul recieves connects with him. Mr. Leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world. he was shut out because he couldn't read. Paul is learning that he is the same way and he is starting to become a great hurdler and is getting better in reading. He realizes that after all that Mr. Leonard trained him to do he should help him in return.
21617	8	2	2	Paul sees that Mr. Leonard did him a kindness in teaching him how to run and jump, especially as Paul is someone who is chosen last in gym, and Mr. Leonard was one of the best college track stars.  Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard's kindness by helping teach him as Paul learns.  Paul and Mr. Leonard have a learning disability in common which helped give Paul the motivation to help someone like him out.

21620	8	2	2	In the story Gifts, Paul finds out information about Mr. Leonard that he never told him. He found out that he was a former track star who broke records in college as a freshman. And this reminded Paul of himself and pushed him to work harder for him.
21625	8	2	2	The effect of the background information on Paul is that he learned that Mr. Leonard also had a reading problem, so they were able to relate.
21627	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he broke all the records he did, and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals when he was only a freshman. Paul also realizes that Mr. Leonard had been trying to help him because he too, was good at something, but couldn't do it because he didn't get good enough grades, because he couldn't read.
21628	8	2	2	Paul felt more of a connection after he had found out about Mr. Leonard's struggles. In paragragh 45, Paul says, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well... ' I believe that sentence shows how Paul felt a mutual connection with Mr. Leonard, after he had found out his background information. Not only do the both participate in hurdles, they also have a common challenge that they have learned to overcome.
21632	8	2	2	The effect that background information Paul has about Mr. Leonard is astonishes Paul greatly. Paul onl;y knew Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor at his school. But Mr. Leonard was more then just a hall monitor. He was a very gifted athlete. He was one of the best back in his days and broke many of records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals as a freshman. Mr. Leonard taught Paul to that he can over come obstacles and never give and stirde for what he wants.
21635	8	2	2	It shows Paul that being good at a sport isnt everything. Mr. Leonard broke records but because he didnt have help with reading he failed his classes and flunked out. It made Paul think that he has someone who understands his troubles with reading.
21636	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's hidden past affects Paul by making him curious. Paul wanted to know why Mr. Leonard would want to keep such accomplishments a secret. Then when he figures out Mr. Leonard can't read, he empathized with him and decides to start his training. Although because at the end he is walking back toward the school it suggests that Paul is going to teach Mr. Leounard how to read.
21638	8	2	2	The background of Mr.Leonard related to the narrator, Pual because Mr.Leonard didnt know how to read when he was in college just like Paul. Paul had the same problem, he couldnt read also. So while Mr.Leonard was teaching Paul to become a good athlete, at the end of the story Paul was now going to teach Mr.Leonard how to read because Paul had already been a remediation class.
21639	8	2	2	The background info that Paul got was inspiring and it motivated him to help Mr. Leonard with what he was having problems with. Because Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt when he told him about his past.
21641	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonards effect on Paul is when Mr. Leonards starts talking about his athlete days about how he lost his scholarship and flunked out and how he could not read and that other schools didnt want a runner that could not read. Thats what made paul realized he was going though the same thing Mr. Leonard went though, and thats the bond that made paul have confadencs and wants to start training.
21642	8	2	2	The narrator is amazed, and also moved by Mr. Leonard's story. Paul takes Mr. Leonard to teach him to read at the very end of the story. Paul feels like he needs to help Mr. Leonard after what he did for Paul.
21643	8	2	2	When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, Paul was surprised. Ex. 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'
21644	8	2	2	The background information that paul found out about Mr. Leonard helped him understand why he wanted to help Paul so much. Then Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, we know this because in the last paragraph Paul says 'It's time to start you trainting.' To Mr. Leonard.
21646	8	2	2	The background information that Paul get on Mr. Leonard, motivates him to work harder for learning how to read and to give him something to work for. When Mr. Leonard spoke of the loss of his scholarship and flunking out of school it made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard had helped him. At the end of Paragraph 45 it reads, 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Which shows that Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21647	8	2	2	When Paul hears of the information about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard e is shocked. He couldn't beleive that the an in front of him was a track star. Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunkred out of college simply because he couldn't read. From that point on Paul helps Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21650	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard was a good hurdle player but he couldn't read.So he was very hard get a job.Paul was shocked about that.And he think he must learn hard.
21651	8	2	2	The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is helpful to him because it makes him feel comfortable with Mr. Leonard. Paul feels out of place and sad that he is a poor reader, but since he shares the same characteristic with Mr. Leonard he feels comfortable with him. At the part of the story when Mr. Leonard states 'We had no learning centers in our school.' it makes Paul feel like he can accomplish what Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to. Also, he feels that he can compensate for Mr. Leonard's training by teaching him to read.
21658	8	2	2	Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard could not read has a very strong affect. Paul can sympathize with Mr. Leonard. Also Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star has a big effect. Paul understands that feeling of embarrassment. Lastly the effect that they are both helping each other. Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to excel in tack, and Paul will teach him how to read better.
21661	8	2	2	The effect the background information gave Paul was that if you try hard then you can become a track star. It also suprised him that Mr. Leonard had never told him about his records. Paul also realized that Mr Leonard and him shared the same feelings of embrassment when it came to school.
21665	8	2	2	It helps him to better understand Mr. Leonard. They have a common problem with reading.
21667	8	2	2	Learning Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul becomes more interested in his life. When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his difficulties in reading, Paul felt like someone finally knew how he felt, and everything that he was saying was familiar to him. Since Mr. Leonard had helped Paul succeed in track and field, Paul decided that he would work with Mr. Leonard and they would succeed in reading together.
21668	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star. Paul must feel proud of being coached by one of the best track stars. Paul could also relay to Mr. Leonard because he knows how it felt not to be able to read out loud or he didn't know answers that everyone else knew.
21669	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to fing out that Mr. Leonard can't read. He finds out they both has the same weaknesses. Paul realizes that if Mr. Leonard can be a great hurdler than he can.
21670	8	2	2	the effect that Paul gets when he gets the backround information on Mr. Leonard was shcok and disbelief. After confronting Mr. leonard about the information, Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this. the information showed that Mt. leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter dash and broke records. But failed out for not being able to read.
21679	8	2	2	Mr. Leonards background information greatly influences Paul. In the story, Paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader. When Paul meets Mr. Leonard and starts to train with him, Paul quickly discovers that Mr. Leonard has broke records in college track. Paul is inspired by the fact that Mr. Leonard, a great athlete, is training him. What inspires Paul even more is the fact that Mr. Leonards also was a had a hard time with his reading. By hearing about someone who has the same problems as him, Paul is inspired to work even harder at both his reading and his track.
21680	8	2	2	After Paul hears Mr. Leonard's background story, Paul responds by asking for Mr. Leonard to follow him back to the school. Paul feels the same way as Mr. Leonard does about not being a good reader. So as a result of Mr. Leonard helping him with his confidence, Paul decides to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
21682	8	2	2	Paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his track scholarship, because he could not keep up with his grades. This made Paul feel better about himself, because he isn't the only on with the problem. it also shows that if you don't give up you can still suceed, even with a few hurdles in the way. He knows now how important it is to keep trying, and that some obstacles in your life can be difficult to jump over.
21685	8	2	2	paul i surprised at the information, he didnt know that he had been training with a track star. and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before.
21686	8	2	2	He became more interested in Mr. Leonard's past in college. After Paul's findings that Leonard broke records as a freshman in college he wanted to be just like him, as successful as him as well, so he continued to do the hurdles. He also felt more of a connection with Leonard when he found out he too had problems reading, and had problems with words.
21687	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was also a track star, and he is in amaze. The track coach and Paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great. But Paul also realized that him and Mr. Leonard had a lot in common, and it inspired him.
21689	8	2	2	Paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased. and he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21693	8	2	2	Paul was amazed that Mr. Leonard's background information was that he broke college records his freshman year. In the story states that Paul took his free time to print out a paper about Mr. Leonard.  He then ask Mr. Leonard, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
21694	8	2	2	Paul finds out, like him, Mr. Leonard cannot read but can run track. Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard had done for him by making him happy with doing track and decidesto teach him how to read because he understarnds the embarassment of not knowing how.      The story states, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddently I realized what I could do for him.' This shows that Paul wanted to thank him in some way, and that way was teaching him to read.
21696	8	2	2	It suprised him at first, but then later on he realized that Mr. Leonard went through the same thing he is going through now. He felt sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because he couldn't read like him.
21697	8	2	2	The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard changes his views. Paul finds out that Mr, Leonard has a reading disability. Paul is inspired by the information about Mr. Loenard because he to has a reading disability. Paul says, ' The emotions on his face were all to familiar to me.' The reason that the emotions are familiar to Paul is because Paul feels those exact emotions almost every day.
21700	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard cannot read either and now Paul does not feel as bad for not being able to read. He also finds out that Mr. Leonard in college was a track star and that motivated him to do better.
21701	8	2	2	Paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star.  When Paul finds out his curiousity is sparked because Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not ever tell Paul about his athletic past.  Paul questions Mr. Leonard about college and discovers that Mr. Leonard had the same reading problems Paul has.  This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21704	8	2	2	the effect it had on paul was that the coach could'nt read either and he flunked out of college, and he could'nt run track. so he did'nt want the same thing to happen to him, because paul has a reading problem so he's got tutor.
21706	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard broke high school records in field and track. Paul also figured out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Since Mr. Leonard had helped Paul out with track, Paul figured he could help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
21707	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day, it's motivation. Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.
21708	8	2	2	Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either. Paul could have helped Mr.Leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling. The background information helped paul understand where Mr.Leonard is coming from, Paul feels that they both come from the same problems. He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together.
21715	8	2	2	I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did. He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing. Another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted Paul to have confindent in himself, and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read.
21717	8	2	2	Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days. Mr. Leonard tells him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good enough student. We had no learning centers in our school.'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading. He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading.
21721	8	2	2	The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities. In paragraph 6, Paul tells Mr. Leonard that he can't read, and that is why he is going to the Learning Center. Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well. Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul, in paragraph 44 lines 4-5, that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard. Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21724	8	2	2	The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
21725	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  In that quote, Paul explains that he went through the same thing, and feelings that Mr. Leonard was going through when he told Paul that he flunked out of college.  Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
21731	8	2	2	The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and neither can Paul. They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them. The background information brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard and gives not only Mr. Leonard to help Paul, but Paul a chance to help Mr. Leonard.
21734	8	2	2	He understands the Mr. Leonard and paul weren't so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help.
21741	8	2	2	When Paul learns Mr. Leonard's background information he feels connected to him. Paul now realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading. Paul sees Mr. Leonard as a motive to get bettter at reading and to persue hurdling in track and field. Paul also sees this as a way to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him.
21743	8	2	2	That background information about Mr. Leonard shocks Paul. Paul then wants to know how Mr. Leonard went from being a track star to a hall monitor by pressing on, 'Well, what happened after that?' This background information then turned out to be a lesson for Paul about recieving a good education and not giving up. Mr. Leonard never had help with reading and he failed college.
21748	8	2	2	In Gifts the effect the background has on Paul is that when he hears Mr. Leonard say he couldn't read, Paul says that he will teach him.  Paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped Paul.
21751	8	2	2	Towards the end of the story, Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard and his past. Pauls learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, just like him. Paul quotes 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards wrods were all too familiar to me.' Paul could easily relate to Mr. Leonard.
21754	8	2	2	He was surprised to find out that they had something in common, they can't read the best. 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.
21755	8	2	2	The effect of the background information on Paul was that saw that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states in the story ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard wards were all to familiar to me.', Paul says this after Mr. Leonard stated ' No other school wanter a runner who couldn't read.'.
21756	8	2	2	I believe that it made him realize that he was just like Mr. Leonard. The fact is that they are both a like in many way's in the way that they act. They both can not read very well. They both are sorta shy. I believe that these two people can make the best of friends. The effect that it has Paul is a great deal because he realizes alot about Mr. Leonard in how much they are a like. In all they both cant read very well at all. They are both good at track. This is why the background information has such effect on him.
21759	8	2	2	Paul realizes that he could give Mr. Leonard something that he couldn't have as a college athlete. He realized that he could make something of himself, with all the help he is recieving, by coaching or teaching help.
21760	8	2	2	In beginning of the story Paul has to go to the Learning Center for help in reading. Then Mr. Leonard finds him and turns him into an athlete, to run hurdles. After Paul sees what Mr. Leonard was he asked him what happened and Mr. Leonard told him. Learning about his reading problems really helped him relate to him. He understood. So in the end he says, 'it is time to start your training.'
21764	8	2	2	Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story.  This helps him to know that they are 'in the same boat'.  They both struggle with, reading in life, but they figure out how to put it behind themselves and turn to something else.     Mr. Leonard ran track in school and went to run in college, but his trouble with reading lead him to quit everything.  Paul, who is trying to improve upon his reading, turns to track to help him in general to just have something to turn to.       Both Mr. Leonard and Paul learn that they both have obstecles in their life, but they learn to deal with them and go on and live their lives.
21772	8	2	2	It effects Paul because he has been training with a person who broke track records in college. It made Paul want to work hard.
21773	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to hear that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he was always knew everything about sports. and when he found out he couldnt read well that also shocked Paul.
21774	8	2	2	The it has on paul is that he and Mr.Leonard have similart storiers in terms of preformance in education. Paul relizing that education is importnat, he dovotes himself to both education and track. Mr.Leonard story inspired paul to do well in school so he does not fluck out like Mr.Leonard did.
21778	8	2	2	The information that Mr. Leonard had reading troubles which stopped him from succeeding helped Paul to understand why he was helping him out.  Also, it gave Paul a chance to understand Mr. Leonards curiosity in him, and gave Paul a chance to help him out.
21780	8	2	2	The background information on of Mr.Leonard has encouraged Paul to do well. I think he feels that if he can get good at track he can do anything he sets his mind to.At first Paul was suprised and honored to know that Mr. Leonard had went to college for track and after he finds out he cant read he feels sorry for him but at the same time he can relate to his story.
21782	8	2	2	That pepeole might be more like you than you think and you can lern form them.'The emotins of Mr. lenerds words we to famililar' This show that he felt like he culd relate to him becouse he gose though simailr things.
21783	8	2	2	Paul is in awe of Mr. Leonard when he sees that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that he broke records. He is kind of confused as to why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track until Mr. leonard tells him it was because of his poor reading skill.
21786	8	2	2	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past, it surprised him that Mr. Leonard was a bad reader just like he was. The information makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him before.
21787	8	2	2	The effect on Paul after reading the background information on Mr.Leonard was shocking. He couldnt believe that he used to do hurdles. He was concerned and interested in knowing about his experience and what happened as he questioned Mr.Leonard. He asked him what happened after that and Mr.Leonard explained how he was in the same situation as Paul but back then they didn't have a Learning Center. People told him that he would get a scholarship and not to worry about his grades so he just got by from his friends helping him which eventually didn't work for colllege because it's way harder. He ended up flunking out and no other school wanted him. Paul felt that since Mr.Leonard was helping him that he would help Mr.Leonard. So as the story ends he is going to help Mr.Leonard learn how to read.
21790	8	2	2	With this information Paul gets he kind of in a way makes a new friend and learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star but can't read like himself. These two people relate together because they both can't read to well.
21792	8	2	2	The effect that background information has on Paul was he felt encouraged about learning how to read becuase when  Mr.Leonard told him that 'my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.
21793	8	2	2	The effect that it has on paul is astonishment. and confusion at first he doesnt understand A. why a famous trck star is a hall monitor at a highschool. and B. why a track star choose him and is teaching him how to do hurdles.
21794	8	2	2	By learning the background information about Mr. Leonard, I believe it encourages Paul more.  When Paul asks Mr. Leonard about what happened after all of that and he tells him about him not being able to read, it makes Paul appreciate the work that Mr. Leonard is doing for him more.  With knowing this Paul also feels more comfortable with talking to and befriending Mr. Leonard because he knows that they both understand on another.
21795	8	2	2	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is substantial. Paul is suprised and impressed by Mr. Leonard's acheivements. When Paul found out why Mr. Leonard flunked out of college it reminded him of his own struggles, like when Paul says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment...'. Paul was touched and motivated by his findings and decided to help Mr. Leonard.
21796	8	2	2	Paul realizes just how much he and Mr. Leonard have in common. When he questions why Mr. Leonard did not tell him, he is not looking for a specific answer. Perhaps he already knew the answer and wanted to confirm his suspicions. He really just wants to understand Mr. Leonard. He then decides that he is going to help Mr. Leonard learn to read because they are more alike than different, and he wants to do something for Mr. Leonard to express his gratitude.
21799	8	2	2	Paul was shock.He didnt not Mr.Leonard (a hall moniter) was fast on the tracks by broking records.Paul and Mr.Leonard was the same they both could barely read but they good  atlehtics so Paul wanted to teach Mr.Leonard how to read since he helped him in trainin to become a track runner.
21803	8	2	2	It had a motivating effect on Paul. Mr. Leonared's time in college help Paul realize that grades do matter and even if he was good at hurdles you have to have a good education as well. This would help Paul feel more like he needs to learn to read for he could be something great just like his coach. He realized that Mr. Leonard wanted to help him to be great at hurdles and have a reason to want to excel in his education. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21804	8	2	2	'Visit this site. Do a search for 'Grabowski'' this line shows that Mr.Leonard was special but the narrator was about to find out what was special. 'I was a good athlete,' he said softly, 'but not a good student' This line was made the narrator realize that they had a lot in common.
21805	8	2	2	The effect that getting this information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is this feeling of obligation to help his friend. This is shown at the end of the story when Paul says ' C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time for your training.' In this case training meant that he was going to help him to read.
21806	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Leonard have a reading problem, and they both are talented hurdlers. This brings these two together into a close relationship. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's reading problem, this makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard, like Mr. Leonard has helped Paul.
21808	8	2	2	The discovery of the records that Mr. Leonard broke effected Paul because he was shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it, and made him believe that he could accomplish almost anything because him and Mr. Leonard shared the same emotions and feelings. An example from the article would be 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'
21809	8	2	2	Well after he printed out the URL page, Paul was shocked. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past. Paul looked up to him. He was impressed that he won 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had the same problems as him he didn't feel like the only one. Mr. Leonard' words were all familar to Paul. For example feelings of embarrassment when paul was called upon and didn't know the anwser. Paul thought how nice of Mr. Leonard to help him excel at something. So Paul decided to help him in return.
21810	8	2	2	The background information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard from the track and field website is surprising to him. He then confronts Mr. Leonard to ask him about why Mr. Leonard had never shared the information with Paul. Then when Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he had flunked out of college because he could not read and was told he could pass college with simply his track scholarship. After being told the whole story by Mr. Leonard, Paul feels a deeper connection and understanding with Mr. Leonard than he felt before finding out this personal information Mr. Leonard had avoided sharing with him.
21811	8	2	2	The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard inspires him to do track and field.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was really good at track and field, but on the other hand he couldn't read. Paul is inspired because Mr. Leonard is just like him.
21814	8	2	2	Paul didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college,w ho broke records and it suprised paul.
21815	8	2	2	In the story 'Gifts' when the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard, this affects Paul in the following ways. First, it makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard is helping someone like him. As you recall, Paul cannot read very well, isn't very good at sports, and he doesn't stand out much for any other reasons. Second, this helps Paul understand why and how Mr. Leonard sympathizes so well with him, since he's been through the same things in his own life. Finally, this makes Paul want to try to help Mr. Leonard in return for all of his efforts by helping Mr. Leonard learn how to read better, since that caused his downfall in college.
21817	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a big effect on Paul. He is also embarrased (just as Mr. Leonard was) because he cannot read. But Mr. Leonard helps him achieve something and it gives him a new confidence about himself.
21818	8	2	2	He feels like he knows were Mr. Leonard was coming from. He feels the same embarrassment now that Mr. Leonard was feeling. He feels like he needs to help Mr. Leonard excel at reading like Mr. Leonard helped him excel at hurdles.
21824	8	2	2	"""The back ground information we get on Mr.Leonard was a great athlete, however; he was just like Paul they both had trouble with reading. Paul was supoportive and was willing to give Mr.Leonard somne trainign."""
21825	8	2	2	In the story the narrator finds background information of Mr. Leonard by recieving a URL from the high school track coach after Paul told the coach he was being trained by him.

Mr. Leonard stopped him in the hallway almost every day when Paul was on his way to the learning center, Mr. Leonard would just glance at his pass and let him go. Eventually, when Mr. Leonard decides to start training Paul on the hurtles, Paul starts getting really good at hurtles and running. Paul was talking with the high school track coach and the coach told him to look at the track and field website, when Paul found Mr. Leonard as one of the past athletes he was shocked. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he was once in college but he had to drop out because he could not read.      I think that since Paul cannot read, this information about Mr. Leonard is very inspiring to him in a sense. Paul realizes he can make it to college but he needs to keep trying unlike Mr. Leonard. Paul has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard and I think that is inspiring.
22019	8	2	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard succeed at reading like Mr. Leonard helped him suceed at hurtles.
22020	8	2	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard has an inspirational effect on Paul.  This is shown in paragraph forty-five when Paul relates his situation of not being able to read well to Mr. Leonard's situation.  Mr. Leonard noticed that and decided to help Paul become a good athlete.  So Paul returned the favor and is going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
22025	8	2	2	The background information just makes Paul want to make Mr.Leonard a better person. He (Paul) felt as if he should be able to help him out since Mr.Leonard helped him out by making him a better runner. So he feels inspired to help him learn/ work on how to read.
22026	8	2	2	The information tells you that Paul and Mr.Leonard are alike. They are both poor students who is not the good of readers. That why Mr. Leonard ask Paul to do the hurdles. He and Paul are alike. If they do something, they work there hardest they will achieve anything.
22027	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard struggled with reading when he was a young boy. Mr. Leonard went to college and was an amazing runner and all through school he was told that his grades did not matter, that he would have tutors to help him. One day, he realized that college was harder than high school. He lost his scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul realized that Mr. Leonard's word were all too familiar. He new the feeling of not being able to read. He knew that learning to read was very important.
22029	8	2	2	The effect of learning about Mr. Leonard's background is that he gains the knowledge that even the most seemingly successful people can suffer from similar struggles to him, and that even the people he respects can use help from others.
22030	8	2	2	The background infromation that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him others go through the same thing and that hes not alone. Pqul also feels the same emotion of embarassment as Mr. Leonard did and he then realized he could help him out to.
22031	8	2	2	The effect that this background information of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is somewhat overwhelming for Paul.  He probably cannot believe he has been working out with such an outstanding star and athlete.  When Paul finds out why Mr. Leonard loses his scholarship, he feels bad for him.  This only encourages Paul more though.  He realizes that Mr. Leonard did not have the programs that kids today do, and with Mr. Leonard showing how much he cares about him.  Paul will be taking full advantage of those programs to learn to read better and become a much better student.
22032	8	2	2	The information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard affects him because he can relate to his story very easily because they both can't read. It also motivates Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22034	8	2	2	The background information that Paul finds on the website given to him, causes him to have a common ground with Mr. Leaonard. Since Mr. Leonard stuggled with reading as well and did extrememly well in Track.
22035	8	2	2	At first Paul is excited to learn he has been training with a track star. Then he realizes that Mr.Leonard has given him a gift, of track, and when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard can't read paul gives him the gift of reading.
22040	8	2	2	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was such a great athlete. When Mr. Leonard told him, 'I was a great athlete, but not a good student,' Paul knew what Mr. Leonard was doing. Paul understaood that Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as him and he wanted to help him as much as he could. Try and get Paul to understand that he can build his confidence. To be a good student and be the good athlete also.
22041	8	2	2	The background information had a great effect on Paul in the story because Paul learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read just like Paul it motivated him to try harder to excel at running hurdles as well as school work. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' This quote proves my point that after learning background information on Mr. Leonard, Paul was ready to get better at track and school.
22042	8	2	2	He listens more to what Mr. Leornard has to say. Also, in paragraphs thirty-three down to fourty-five, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but flunked out of college. This fact got Paul to work harder at hurdles and help Mr. Leonard.
22043	8	2	2	After learning the background information of Mr. Leonard, the effect it has on Paul changes his views. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was a great athlete that even broke records his freshman year of college. When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out, he can't imagine why. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to know that an athletic career might get him a scholarship, but won't save him embaressment if he doesn't know how to read. After Paul learns Mr. Leonard is still embaressed that he can't read, Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard with the same confidence he gave to Paul. Paul takes the initiative to in turn, train Mr. Leonard in reading, as Mr. Leonard has trained Paul to have confidence in both reading and life.
22048	8	2	2	He has more respect for the lessons Leonard is teaching him because he finds out Leonard was a track star so he probably knows what he is doing.
22050	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul.  He has many emotions going through his head because he realizes that he is a younger version of Mr. Leonard.  He thinks about how he knows the feelings Mr. Leonard felt.  Since Mr. Leonard helps him so much on hurdles, he is going to help him read.  The fact that Mr. Leonard had never gotten the remediation that Paul was getting in school now, makes Paul even more motivated.
22051	8	2	2	Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul acheieve in something else. Mr. Leonard was at the time where he didnt have what Paul has. Mr. Leonard relied on friends to help him get by. Paul works harder now becuase collage scouts told Mr. Leonard that grades didnt matter but the real truth was that they did. Mr. Leonard flunked out because collages didnt want a runner that couldn't read.
22052	8	2	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's past made Paul understand that someone understood how he felt. In lines 45-47, Paul says that he and Mr. Leonard both feel the same way about their reading issues. He also realized that he could return Mr. Leonards generosity and in line 46 implies that he will do this by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.  Paul became more motivated by Mr. Leonard's story, both about running the hurdles and learning to read.
22053	8	2	2	"""Paul wonders what happened to Mr. Leonard that would have him ending up being a janitor and when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of college it helps him remember that he needs to learn how to read well. The narrator doesn't want to feel embarrassed anymore and seeing Mr. Leonard and finding out about his past makes it feel even more crucia; for him to learn to read so he can better himself in life because only he can decide his future and it helps him realize that now that he has the tools to suceed, he should help Mr. Leonard out too."""
22054	8	2	2	The background information has an empathetic effect on Paul. He realises that Mr. Leonard has had a hard life and that he didn't get to do what he wanted to do. Paul starts to feel the need to help Mr. Leonard back, by helping him to learn to read.
22055	8	2	2	The information helps Paul realize what he can achieve if he works hard. Mr. Leonard was and excellent athlete but not a good student so he was given a scholorship for track and field even though he did not recieve good grades. He later flunked out of college because he did not earn good grades by not worrying about them. He wants Paul to work hard and learn how to read so he does not have to go through what he did. It shows Paul how to get over obstacles.
22060	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a record breaking college hurdler he is surprised.  This makes him wonder why he is pushing him to be an athlete, which he finds out is because Paul and Mr. Leonard are almost the same person but at different points in their lives.
22062	8	2	2	When paul finds out Mr. Leonard was an old track star he wanted to know why he didnt tell him. Then he asked why he stopped. Mr. Leonard was embrassed to say that he had got kicked out of college because he couldn't read, and his grades weren't there.  Paul knew what it felt like to not be able to read. Since Mr. Leonard was there to help him become better, Paul said ' It's time to start your training'. Saying that he was going to teach him to read.
22064	8	2	2	When Paul researched Mr. Leonard, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt share his past with him. Paul didn't understand why Mr. Leonard would keep his track achievements a secret. Paul was shocked and confused. Paul said 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.'  Mr. Leonard replied, 'I remeber, best race of my life.' Then Paul asked himwhat had happened.
22068	8	2	2	Just as Paul is finding all of the background information on Mr. Leonard, he is beginning to realize that he too can agree and relate to him because they both have that in common where reading and speaking aloud in the classroom is and always has been a struggle for them. They have both looked for help in the learning center so they could finally become a better reader and be better at something in school. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me'. 'I knew them well, feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  Paul knew the feeling, he shared the exact same struggle with Mr Leonard.
22071	8	2	2	Paul most likely feels like he can relate more to Mr. Leonard. He knows that they both have a difficult time reading. He feels like there is a kind of connection beween the two of them. He knows that they both struggled with the same thing, and he figures if Mr. Leonard can help him gain confidence and be good at something, he can help him learn how to read.
22072	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got motivated him to put MR. Leonard through training to teach him how to read because Mr. Leonard helped him to become a track runner. He knows the embarrassing feelings that Mr. Leonard must have felt and now wants to help him overcome his problems.
22080	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard can't read and trys to help him. Mr. Leonard dosen't want anyone to know that he can't read so he hides it.
22086	8	2	2	He believes that if Mr. Leonard was a poor reader but could excel at track, he could too. He feels like he and Mr. Leonard have a lot in common and begins to feel a connection with him.
22088	8	2	2	The effect of the background information Paul gets from the URL the high school track coach gives him is fairly great. Knowing that Mr.Leonard was a poor student and couldnt read just like paul is now brought them closer together. This is strongly supported in the last two sentences.
22089	8	2	2	Once Paul realized that Mr. Leonard suffered the same difficulties with literacy that he himself struggles with, Paul has a new sympathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul, appreciative of the effort Mr. Leonard is putting into helping him overcome his troubles, decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to do what troubled him in his college years. Their shared difficulty with learning to read gives them a similar perspective and allows each to sympathize and assist in any way they can.
22090	8	2	2	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard was an incredible athlete but a terrible student. The information caused Paul to feel empathy toward Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same situsation that Mr. Leonard had been when he was a student.  Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul become a better athlete and a better student by motivating him on the track field, and it works. Because of Paul's empathy towards Mr. Leonard, he is inspired to aide Mr. Leonard in his reading studies.
22091	8	2	2	It gives Paul respect for the man who went through the same experience Paul is going through now.  He felt Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar.  He knew that Mr. Leonard started training him to make Paul feel better about himself, just as he had so many years ago.  Paul felt he should return the favor, and is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22093	8	2	2	The information he egt inspires him to teach Mr. Leonard to read just as he tought him to do hurdles.
22094	8	2	2	In the story when Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star and won many metals he was shocked. And when he learned that he had to stop track because he could not read it made Paul feel more couraged to read and be a track star.
22096	8	2	2	The effect that the backgroud information has on Paul is that its going to help him to succed in his career in the future. when he foud out that Mr.leonard was a college freshman athlete that raced in the 400 metter hurdles and he won nationals he was surpriced that Mr.leonard  had accomplished that.But Paul asked why he had stoped his career in track and Mr.leonard told him he was really good at track but he had a hard time learning and reading that they had give him the wrong advice. Paul is compared to Mr.leonadr in the way that both of them have a hard time learning but they are really good in the same sport. Mr.leonar dis helping Paul realize to study ahrd and he would accmplish many things in life like how he learned how to jump hurdles.It was going to be the same with school is like a hurdle you have to practice to accomplish thing in life.
22097	8	2	2	In the story Paul gradually gathers information about Mr. Leonard. At fisrst, this information makes Paul suspicious of Mr. Leonard.  He asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him.  When Mr. Leonard explains his reasons, Paul is understanding and decides to help Mr. Leonard.  This background information makes Paul realize what he can do to help Mr. Leonard.
22099	8	2	2	According to the story, the background about Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a very positive way. Paul sees how good Mr. Leonard could have been at track, so that motivates him to keep working hard in school and in track. In the story, when Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.', that shows the readers what Mr. Leonard means to Paul. Mr. Leonard's was a lot like Paul when he was a boy, and that has an effect on Paul. Paul now wants to strive forward and be the best he can be.
22102	8	2	2	he thinks about it and it reminds him about himself and what he had been going through so at the end he takes Mr. Leonard and says 'it's time to start your training'.
22105	8	2	2	When he was told that Mr. Leonard had been a college track star I think that made him open his eyes a little wider and relize who he was working with after he went to that URL. ' you were a college freshemen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals'. you broke records'. when he saw that then he relized that he wasnt jsut working with a hall monitor he was working with a star.
22106	8	2	2	The background information effected Paul by showing him you can be anything. Paul thought Mr. Leonard was just another janitor, but he wasn't. In the story Paul shows excitement when he talked about Mr. Leonard breaking records and winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul had the effect of someone he could look up to and learn from. When Mr. Leonard told Paul he couldn't read, Paul told him it was his turn to train. Paul was happy to have a coach who did something great in his past. Paul realized you can't ever judge a book by its cover because you never know whats in the pages.
22107	8	2	2	Paul was suprised to know that he had been training with a college track star that broke records on a national level. The reader can tell he was shocked when the narrator say, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Then the narrator asks him what had happend and was suprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that Paul had.
22108	8	2	2	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about this and Paul finds himself relating to his story because Paul is not a good reader and neither is Mr. Leonard. This story about Mr. Leonard doesnt really discourage Paul but he finds himself wanting to help Mr. Leonard the same way he helped him.
22110	8	2	2	It encourages him. Then he wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22111	8	2	2	The narrarator received background information from the track coach about Mr. Leonard Grabowski.  Mr. Grabowski was a record breaking hurdles runner back in the day, but at college his grades were so poor that he lost his scholarship and flunked out.  Due to his disability to read properly he had lost it all.       When the narrarator asked Mr. Grabowski about his past the narrarator saw similar emotions to what he was going through when he got embarrased as he struggled at reading aloud or when he didn't know the answer that everyone else in his class knew.  The narrartor completely understood why Mr. Leonard was embarrased by his past.
22113	8	2	2	He learns about him breaking records in college, and being amazing at track. This changes his view on Mr. Leonard. I think this makes him respect him more. When he finds out about his reading struggle, this allows him to relate with Mr. Leonard.
22114	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets on Mr.Leonard helps encourage Paul to keep going and to learn and to teach Mr.Leonard how to read. Mr.Leonard said 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' Paul said at the evnd 'C'mon Mr. Leonared Its time to start your trainging.'
22115	8	2	2	Paul relates to Mr. Leonard's story because Paul couldn't read either. In paragraph 6, Paul states that he goes to the learning center because he can't read, and in paragraph 44, Mr. Leonard states that he was an exceptional athlete that could not read. Also, hearing this story has changed Paul because he wants to be able to give back to Mr. Leonard what the hall monitor gave to him. He does this by telling Mr. Leonard to come with him to start his training in reading (paragraph 46).
22117	8	2	2	Paul understands what Mr. Leonard went through because Paul is in the same situation as he was. Paul feels that since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track that he must help him learn to read.
22118	8	2	2	The background information helps Paul better relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul has reading problems just as Mr. Leonard does and he feels like he is more welcomed by someone that has the same problem as him. In my opinion, Paul is glad to finally have someone empathetic of his situation.
22121	8	2	2	Paul believes since Mr. Leonard is helping him gain confidience that he has to help Mr. Leonard some how. Mr Leonard wants Paul to be able to fill his dreams unlike Mr. Leonard who didn't get that opurtunity.
22122	8	2	2	After getting all of that background information, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was trying to make Paul better and that Paul needed to do something for him in return after finding out that Mr.Leonard had flunked out of college and didn't get to finish out his college career.
22123	8	2	2	Paul knows what Mr. Leonard is going threw, he himself cant read. Mr. Leonard conviences Paul to do track. Mr Leonard was a colloge drop out. He cant read and Paul wants to make him happy.
22126	8	2	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard has a profound effect on Paul. It helps Paul to understand why Mr. Leonard did not ask questions after Paul told him where he was going, as is shown in Paragraph 45. Paul can see that Mr. Leonard regrets not having the Learning Center to help him learn to read. This makes Mr. Leonard want to help Paul so Paul doesn't suffer the same consequences. Because of this, Paul can understand why Mr. Leonard treated him the way he did.
22127	8	2	2	The effect of the background information is understading.  The similarities of Mr. Leonard and Paul give them  a connection that furthurs their relationship.  By them both doing well in track gives them an opprotunity to bond and for Mr. Leonard to help teach.  By them both struggling with reading gives Paul an opprotunity to give back and help Mr. Leonard.
22130	8	2	2	The reader finds out that Mr. Leonard is a 400 meter hurdles champion his freshman year of college. Paul was taken by surprise when he realized he was trainning with a champion hurdle star. Paul was pushed in track while trainning with a champion without knowing he was until he was given a website that had Leonard on it!
22132	8	2	2	Well it pushes Paul to really work hard.  Paul is wanting to be a great hurdler.  You can tell that in the story when he gets help.  He was getting trained to do well at it.
22133	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out that when Mr. Leonard was in school he could read either. Mr. Leonard see's himself in Paul as a kid and wants to help him. It shows Paul even the best athletes, scholars, or anything aren't perfect, just because they are amazing at what they do, doesnt mean they have an easy life outside of that sport, school function, or even job.
22135	8	2	2	The effect that background info. has on Paul is he now sees Mr. Leonard as an idol and coach. Considering since Mr. Leonard broke records at nationals in his freshman year of college.
22136	8	2	2	During the story, the reader learn's some of Mr. Leonard's nackround. The effect of that backround information on paul is that at first he doesn't know anything about Mr. Leonard. Paul just thinks that he is a hall monitor to tell students where to go. As the story goes on, Paul starts to learn more about Mr. Leonard and the information starts to incourage Paul. By the end of the story, Pual and Mr. Leonard know enough about each other that Paul takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him read as Mr. Leonard helped Paul run hurdles.
22137	8	2	2	Paul relieved that there are other people out there that has the same learning problems as he does and to know that Mr. Leonard broke a recorded in college for track was amazing to him.
22138	8	2	2	After finding out the backround information on Mr. Leonard, Paul understands why the older man is helping him and then Paul decides to try and help the older man with his trouble reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped him become a fast runner. One can see the effect that backround information has on Paul when he says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could de for him.'
22141	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and Paul didn't really understand why he didn't tell him about his past. With Paul knowing what happened to Mr. Leonard in his past because he couldn't read it could influence Paul to work harder to learn how to read.
22142	8	2	2	Paul is supprised when he finds out that the reason Mr. Leonard quit running track is that he can't read.'No other schools wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul had the same emotion about the situation as Mr. leonard.
22143	8	2	2	The backround information effects Paul in a way that makes him connect more to Mr. Leonard and have a better understanding of why Mr. Leonard was encouraging him to run. Paul does not know how to read just as Mr. Leonard did not know how to read when he was in school. By Paul realizing that Mr. Leonard was trying to improve him and teach him to continue on, it allowed Paul to feel like he is not alone and other poeple are like him.
22145	8	2	2	Paul is told to explore this website about Mr. Leonard. Paul was shocked to see how good Mr. Leonard was. This information lead into that Mr. Leonard could not read. Paul offered to help Mr. Leonard so he could feel better.
22146	8	2	2	Paul was supprised that Mr. Leonard was very talented at track, and he wanted to know why Mr. Leonard hadn't told him. Paul begins to ask a lot of questions and he learns the truth about Mr. Leonard.
22148	8	2	2	That Mr. Leonard is exactly like Paul who has a hard time reading. When Mr. Leonard showed Paul about his past, he realized that him and Paul are very alike. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read and there was no help for him with his reading skills.
22149	8	2	2	Paul feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard becasue Paul  didn't know how to read at first either.  It also made him realize that if Mr. Leonard could teach him how to run track that he could teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
22151	8	2	2	The effect that the background has on Paul, is that he wants to know why Mr. Leonard never mentioned about him being a hurdler in college. Also wanting to know why he didn't stay in college. Paul wants to have somebody to look up to so he wants to help both him and Mr. Leonard.
22152	8	2	2	Paul goes to the website that the teacher gives him and searches Mr. Leonard, just as he is told. When he finds out the he was a star track athlete in college, he starts to get really encouraged and understands more. But when he goes to Mr. Leonard and asks why he never told him about it he is kidna embarrassed about it, becasue he flunked out of college cause he could not read just like Paul could not. And that made Paul work even harder and be more encouraged to do it.
22155	8	2	2	The background information that Paul has on Mr. Leonard is that Mr. Leonard is like Paul, because they have trouble reading. When Paul finds out out the information about Mr. Leonard he is dissapointed that he fluncked out of college and that he was good at jumping hurdles. Mr. Leonard got a scholarship from a college to jump hurdles in there track team, but the work was hard that he flunked out.
22158	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a track star in his Freshman year of college. It makes Paul want to teach Mr. Leonard how to read. Paul wants to make Mr. Leonard even more proud now that he found that out.
22159	8	2	2	That when Paul had the story in his hands, he was confused about why Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul about his past. I pulled the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' He looked at me quizzically, then smiled sadly at the image on the page. When Paul found out when Mr. Leonard couldn't read he felt like since he helped me, he will help him.
22161	8	2	2	The information makes him understand what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through similar things. They both had problems in school and now not only is school the same between them, but track is to. I believe that it gives him hope while running, because if Mr. Leonard could do it, so can he.
22162	8	2	2	The background information lets Paul know just how talented Mr. Grabowski had once been. He can also understand where Mr. Grabowski is coming from because he also has trouble with reading. This information motivates Paul, and in the end he wants to help Mr. Grabowski. You know this because Paul says, 'C'mom, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' This training is most likely in reading.
22163	8	2	2	Paul found out the Mr. leonard was a track star and didnt know how to read. He thought Mr. Leonard was just trying to help him. But realized mr. leonard wanted help too. Finding out that a good track star lost everything because he couldnt read made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22169	8	2	2	When Paul learned some background information about Mr. Leonard, Paul realized that him and Mr. Leonard are a lot alike. The quote from the text, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' explains how Paul felt like he was similar to Mr. Leonard.This then made Paul excited and want to help help him.
22170	8	2	2	The narrator finds out that in high school, Mr. Leonard wasn't good in school, but could run really well. When Mr. Leonard got to college, he flunked out. I think this effects Paul because he now has someone who knows what he's going through. Now, the narrator and Mr. Leonard can rely on each other.
22174	8	2	2	When he finds out that his track coach used to be a star in college he doesn't understand why he would go from that to being a janitor at a high school. When paul asks him why he explains that he can't read either.      when Paul finds out that he isn't alone and that the janitor has the same problem he does he decides since he helped paul learn how to run track and jump hurdles that paul should teach him how to read.
22175	8	2	2	The information that the reader learns only motivates him to help Mr. Leonard.
22177	8	2	2	The backround information about Mr. Leonard is that he was a track star and he flunked out of college because he could not read. The effect that Mr. Leonard's backround information had on Paul was he felt sorry for him so he wanted to help. Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
22178	8	2	2	Like Mr. Leonard, Paul realizes the same feelings he has for not being able to read. Paul also realizes that Mr.Loenard has given him time to excel at something and it made him want to help Mr.Leonard by training him to read.
22180	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles  at the nationals and broke records.  He also learned that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read either.  Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul he wanted to return the favor by helping him learn how to read.
22182	8	2	2	Paul was sprisd that the couch not being able to read. they had something in comen now
22183	8	2	2	Paul is surprised to find out that Mr.Leonard was such a big star. He wondered why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his track achievments.

22199	8	2	2	The background infomation on Mr.Leonard has a major impact on Paul's behavior. At first, Paul thought he was alone and was in dispair as shown by his inability to read and exceed in sports. But when Paul found out about the infomation, he realizes that he is not alone.

This understanding causes Paul to feel sorry for Mr. Leonard, but motivated to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22214	8	2	2	By knowing who Mr. Leonard is he can trust his coaching a lot more and look up to him. When he found out that he broke records he was anxious and exicted to know what happened. By Mr. Leonard having all those records it really motivated Paul.
22215	8	2	2	Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard because he had been helping him out and he hadnt even got to finish his dream. Paul decides hes going to do something to help him in return. So hes going to start 'training' Mr. Leonard to read!
22219	8	2	2	because paul is like a younger version of mr. leonard. paul sees what he maybe could become. mr. leonard see's it to. you might be good at a sport but you need to be able to reqad. mr. leonard couldnt do that so he wants paul to succed
22223	8	2	2	He knows that Paul goes down to get help on his readin but that doesnt matter to him because all that matter is that he can run fast and they want him on the school track team. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to run for the college team and that he broke record Paul did not understand what happened to that. He found out that Mr. Leonard couldnt read just as Paul couldnt so Paul decided that he was going to help him learn how to read.
22224	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was the national champion of the 400 meter hurdles when he was in college, but flunked out because he couldn't read. Learning this information motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard, just as Mr. Leonard helped him become involved with a sport. Mr. Leonard didn't just help him jump over hurdles, he helped Paul excel at something because he couldn't excel in reading.
22225	8	2	2	In this story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem as well. With the information that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and that he broke records, proves to Paul that no matter what the circumstances are in life, everyone can overcome the hard times and overcome the hurdles in their lives. This information encourages Paaul to do his best and prove he is good enough to be treated like asny other individual.
22226	8	2	2	You can tell that the information Paul had found about Mr.Leonard made him want to became a better reader because he didn't want to be like him who couldn't read. In paragraph 45 Paul say's 'feelings of embarrasment when I was called upon to read aloud or did know the answer everyone else knew'. By him saying that it show's that he really related to him.
22233	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him, and that he is really grateful Mr. Leonard is helping him, so in the end he helps Mr. Leonard.
22235	8	2	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he realizes why the man did not know his name from seeing his hall pass every day.  Paul immediatly feels sympathy for the man because Paul knows exactly how it feels to not understand how to read.  They both tried hard, but sometimes it takes more than that, sometimes it takes a friend.  With someone by your side seemingly impossible tasks can be accomplished.
22237	8	2	2	Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. He felt bad for Mr. Leonard and he wanted to help him so in the end of the story he does. I think that it also motivated Paul to do better in school too and it was nice for him to be able to relate to someone about his learning diabilities.
22238	8	2	2	The backround information Paul gets suprises him. He knows that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but a bad reader just like Pau was. He knows that Mr. Leonard doesn't want Paul to make the same mistakes he did.
22240	8	2	2	I think that Paul was surprised and embarassed all at once.  Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was helping him because he was just like him in school, except did the right thing.  Mr. Leonard didn't try at school like Paul or didn't get help from teachers like Paul seeked to do.  I think Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard had broken records when he said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 mete hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  I think paul didn't see this coming.  He was shocked that he was being trained by someone who had accompished such amazing tasks.
22245	8	2	2	It effects him, because he is the same as Mr. Leonard, in the sense of not being able to read.It also effects because he knows how the embarrasment feels of not being able to read, and the fact the Mr. Leonard 'has given his to help hime eexcel at something'.
22249	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard was shocking to Paul. Paul was shocked to see that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Paul found out later that Mr. Leonard flucked out of college because he could not do the work, because of the lack of help he got in high school. Paul now wants to do the best that he can in school so he can be a track star and also do extremly well in school.
22250	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard and it makes him want to try because if he has someone that is that talented help him it will motivate him to do good. Paul trys hard because he wants to show Mr.Leonard that he can do it and that he dont want to get picked last any more when he is playing a sport. Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that you dont just get picked because you are good at a sport you have to know how to read and do math and things like that. Thats why Paul needs to do good in school and not just sports. when Mr. Leonard was in collage he could not go to a learning center because they didnt not have one back then.     Mr.Leonard told Paul to take advatige of the learning center and get the help cause he needs it.
22253	8	2	2	It has an effect on paul because Mr. Leonard can't read like Paul. They both are good runners and can do herdles, and they both never learned how to read so the were alike.
22254	8	2	2	The effect on Paul from finding some background information is that Paul is shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 Hurdles in sectionals and that Mr. Leonard also broke records. Mr. Leonard was struggling accademicly so once he flunked out no other collage wanted a athalete that could not read.
22257	8	2	2	The effact it had on paul was great. It made Paul relate more to Leonard, and encouraged him to do better. When he learns that Leonard can not read, he is encouraged to help his newly found friend out to teach him to read, just as Leonard help him find something the Paul could excell at.
22259	8	2	2	Paul learns by reading about Mr. Leonard on the website, that he was a great hurdler that broke national records. So he wants to know why Mr. Leonard never mentioned it. When he tells him why, Paul realizes that he is just like him and sees that even though you cant read, you can still succeed.
22263	8	2	2	The information that Paul found out about was suprising, because he didn't know anything about Mr. Leonard being good in track. He found it hard to believe he flunked college.
22267	8	2	2	This new information changes his whole view of Mr. Leonard. He now realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, Paul, in that he has trouble with being able to read as well.
22269	8	2	2	When Paul gets backround information on Mr. Leonard he is empathetic, because he can't read either. Paul also said,' I knew them well----feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. ' This statement shows how he is empathetic. After this though he becomes strived to achieve in training for hurtles.
22272	8	2	2	The effect of the background information on Paul was supriseing because he didn't know that Mr.Leonard was a allstar athlete and even in school he had reading problems. Mr.Leonard wanted to show Paul that he could over come his problems of not being able to read.
22273	8	2	2	He goes to the website the track coach gives him. To Paul's disbelief, he finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a track star. Paul couldn't believe what he had found out. He was astonished to see that Mr. Leonard had won national races and broke records. He confronted Mr. Leonard about all of it. He found out that Mr. Leonard also had issues reading and flunked out of college because of it.
22274	8	2	2	The information really changes the view of Mr. Leonard in that at first from the aritcle he read he felt more admiring of him. Later when Mr Leonard tells him that he can't read he is smpathetic and more close to him because Mr. Leonard is like him.
22278	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard embodies the once great, old mentor cliche. Because Paul is unaware of Mr. Leonard's past, and is used to following his orders, Paul is willing to try the things Mr. Leonard confronts him with. As stated in paragraph one, the last sentence, 'everyone complied.' No one questioned Mr. Leonard, and therefore his past was never questioned.     When Mr. Leonard becomes empathetic towards Paul, it changes things. When you become used to someone, it becomes easier to question and learn about them. Paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the Mr. Leonard's 'gaze softened' towards Paul.     Not knowing about Mr. Leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship. When the coach writes out a web address and tells Paul, 'Visit this site. Do a search for 'Grabowski,'' it precludes the notion that Mr. Leonard's life was dull and without bother for question. Rather, it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery.     Finally, when Paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor, the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground. Once the existance of this common ground is justified, that is, once Paul realizes that there is a common place between them, Leonard Grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure.     For that reason the discovery of Mr. Leonard's past effects Paul, and the background information that was previously missing completes the puzzle and lays the groundwork for a more realistic and compelling relationship between mentor and student.
22279	8	2	2	Once Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has the same reading problem as him, Paul wants to help him just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. Paul knows where Mr. Leonard is coming from by the 'emotion in Mr. Leonards vocie', 'the feelings of embarrassment', and not being excepted because 'no schools wanted a track runner who couldnt read.' So, Paul understanding Mr. Leonards situations, wants to help him train to be a good reader Just like Paul was trained to be a good track runner.
22281	8	2	2	The new information motivates Paul to do well, and even to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22283	8	2	2	After knowing the background about Mr. Leonard, Paul seemed to admire him. When Paul first found out about all the records Mr. Leonard had broke he was amazed and shocked at the same time. Paul also felt sad for Mr. Leonard since he could not read. Paul wanted a way to help Mr. Leaonard, since he had helped him. So, he told him it was time for him to learn!
22285	8	2	2	The background information helps Paul understand that Mr.Leonard was in the same situation that he is in high school. Mr.Leonard couldnt read but he was good as an athlete just as Paul is. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard learn to read.
22296	8	2	2	The informatin Paul recived aabout Mr. Leeonard makes Paul feel better. Pauls dont feel alone for not being able to read good because Mr. Leonard didn't do good in school either.
22299	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard failed out of college and lost his athletic scholarship because he couldn't read.  This causes Paul to sympathize with Mr. Leonard, because he knows how the man feels.  They are both embarassed because of their inability to read, so they both help each other.  Mr. Leonard helps Paul improve his athleticism through track, and Paul begins to teach Mr. Leonard to read.  Paul also realizes that he is not alone, and that when another person helps you, you can also benefit them.
22300	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background imformation effects Paul because when Mr. Leonard was young he flunked out of college because he said no one wanted atrack runner who could not read. Mr. Leonard is alo embarassed to admit he had flunked out of college. This has an effect on Paul because Paul is not so good at reading and is embarrased to go to a learning center for tutoring. This is why Mr. Leonard's background effected Paul and Paul's motivation.
22301	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that the man who was coaching him at hurdling was a college star who broke national records, he feels a little confused and more honored to be taught by someone like this. Supporting details that Paul was confused could be when he brought up the page he printed off from the website where he discovered Mr. Leonard's past. Mr. Leonard didn't seem too enthused by it, but Paul continued to pry and find out what happened. Once he knew, Paul then felt empathetic toward Mr. Leonard, since they shared the same problem.
22302	8	2	2	The effect of the background information that Paul found on Mr. Leonard was that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, because of this, Paul realizes how important it is to learn and not give up in school. I feel that being in track will make Paul a better student and he will recognize how important learning is to make it through college.
22304	8	2	2	The background information that Paul recieves just sort of gives him an inspiration to continue trying his best. He learns from Mr. Leonard the importance of studying and making good grades. For example, Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his poor grades. This point proves that without good grades Paul will basically go no where and end up being a hall monitor.
22308	8	2	2	Paul is deeply moved because he can relate with Mr. Leonard about not being able to read. Paul wants to help him learn how to read since he is being taught at the learning center himself. Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to learn when he was younger. He is also surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about his track successes in college. Paul sees that he is a modest person who doesn't flaunt his gifts and talents.
22309	8	2	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul found out effects Paul because both have reading problems. Mr. Leanoard states 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' Mr. Leonard has taught Paul to become a good athlete as of right now Paul can't read very good. Mr. Leonard had the problem of not being able to read well like Paul has now.
22310	8	2	2	He feels empahy for Mr. Leonard. He knows how it feels to not do well when it comes to school. Paul feels embbarrassed when he has o ead aloud or doesn't know an answer everyone else knows.
22312	8	2	2	Paul gets the information about Mr. Leonard from the high school track coach, and not from Mr. Leonard himself. Paul is a little disappointed the next day that he did not get the information directly from Mr. Leonard. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about his college career, and he explains that he was a great runner, but did not do well in the classroom. This makes Paul understand why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his track career, and Paul feels he needs to help Mr. Leonard as he helped him.
22317	8	2	2	The information helped the Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him, and when he finally figures it all out. It only makes him want to try harder and also help Mr. Leonard learn to read to, when he says ' C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.'
22318	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets on Mr. Leonard has an effect on him because it inspries him to help Mr. Leonard since he found out he cant read so when he did he found that out he said 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' walking back toward the school. 'It's time to start your training.'
22320	8	2	2	The background information Paul got about Mr.Lenoard effected him because he knew someone who was very good at track was teaching him. When Mr.Leoard told Paul he couldnt read and he flunked out of college because he couldnt read it made Paul want to work hard. Paul helped Mr.Leonard read.
22323	8	2	2	The information that paul gets on Mr. Leonard is a big part of the effect that he has on Paul. Paul realizes that they relate to eachother alot and that it makes sense why Mr. Leonard is being so helpful to him. They share the same emotions , as Paul says the feelings of embarassment when approached with not being able to read, they are one in the same.
22324	8	2	2	The effect of the background information has on Paul is that is shows him that Mr. Leonard was just like him. He finds out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Mr. Leonard says in the story that he couldn't read, but back then there were no remdial reading programs. He also flunked out of college because of it, but the information shows Paul that Mr. Leonard is just trying to give this kid the help he couldn't get when he was in that situation.
22328	8	2	2	The effect that the background has on Paul is that he is shocked because Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past of being a former track player and couldn't read and Paul had wondered why Mr. Leonard was helping him.
22330	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard broke records in college but then didn't finish college, made him confused. When Mr. Leanard told Paul that the reason he couldn't finish college because he didn't take school seriously, Paul was surprised and knew that if he followed his dreams and worked hard at school and life, he could accomplish anything. Since Paul had the privilege to work hard in school and do a sport that he worked hard to be good at, he would do anything to succeed. Mr. Leonard believed that Paul had potential.
22333	8	2	2	Paul is shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading also, but that did not stop him from succeeding in a sport. Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him and feels that he should help Mr. Leonard read now.
22334	8	2	2	As one is reading this section, one may notice that Mr. Leonard is from the start a very important man in the narrators life.  One may also notice that as time goes on and after the narrator or Paul, recieves the URL, that he find not only helped Paul but was also a famous runner.  He had broken many records and was very fast at running.  After Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had not choosen to tell Paul about his famous ascubuidy, he discovers that Mr. Leonard had flunked out and that he could not read.  Paul instead of feeling disapiontment, one may feel that he gained respect for Mr. Leonard.  I believe this to be true because in this article Paul says this, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard.  Its time to start your training.'
22336	8	2	2	The background information that Paul receives gives him more confidence because there is a grown man who went through the same things he was going through. When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read but still went to college showed that there was hope for him even though Mr. Leonard flunked out. He knew that if he pushed and worked hard at learning to read and with track, he could go to college as well.
22341	8	2	2	Paul reads that Mr. Leonard was a great track and when he asks Mr. Leonard about it he says that he lost his scolarship and flunked out. Paul can relate, because he says he's one of the 'select few in the remedial reading program.' He feels empathetic for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him learn to read, and maybe help him get some of his confidence back.
22342	8	2	2	It really inspires him it shows him that Mr. Leonard knows what he is talking about. But is concerned at the fact that he doesnt know how to read so sense Mr. Leonard helped Paul with sport he is goin to teach him how to read.
22347	8	2	2	The backgorund information is really important in this story, or it would really have never ended. The backgorund information came from the track coach, just curious to see if Paul would actually check it out. He did, and found out that the guy that was helping him was a real athlete, but once Paul talked to him, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he did. He couldn't read. So for Paul to find that out is pretty important, because Mr. Leonard, will push Paul to do and good in school, and take his place as a track hero.
22349	8	2	2	The effect the information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonardo is sympathetic. He finds out that Mr Leonardo was a wonderful athlete, but he didn't make it far because he couldn't stay in college because he couldn't read. After finding this out, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
