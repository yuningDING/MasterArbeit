4933	3	2	2	A panda and a koala beer are similar because they both eat one type of food. A panda eats bamboo, and a Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. They are also both specialists, but a python is a generalist. Meaning they can adapt to their surroundings. Pandas and koala beers can't adapt.
4937	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. They both require specific resources and climate to survive. These limits them to only their natural habitats. This makes pandas and koalas much different than pythons. Pythons are generalists and can survive in many different places. That is why pythons are being found naturally in Florida but not koalas or pandas.
4941	3	2	2	A panda beer is similar koala to a koala bear because they both only eat one food for the most part. Pandas eat bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. But a python is a more diverse and invasive animal. I eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians.
4961	3	2	2	"""Well in China a specialist is a panda who eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Australian koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. They're both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere. """"A python swallowed an alligator..."""" They'll eat anything but the panda and the koala stick with what they know which is the bamboo and the eucalyptus leaves."""

""""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""". They both rely on specific food sources that are found only in certain areas. This differs from the pythons who can thrive in many different environments and have a more varied diet."""
4991	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only survive in very special climates with specific food sources. These are different from pythons because pythons can adapt better and eat many different things. This is shown in the map provided with the article because it shows pythons could survive in 17 states.
4998	3	2	2	Pandas in China, and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists. So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive. Pythons are generalists, they can move anywhere and adapt to their surroundings to survive. In the article it says that the pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves.
5002	3	2	2	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because both species live in only one area around the world. Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. But both pandas and koalas are different than the python because a python can eat many foods and live in different areas around the world.
5032	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both require special native food. Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China. The koala which lives in Australia, only eats eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they are both specialist animals. They are both different from pythons because whereas the python can survive in the south of of the U.S, the panda and koala need to continue to live where they live now.
5035	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar for they are both specialists species, meaning that they are stable creatures who live the same lifestyle. For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species. That means that it is able to adapt to changes. It can eat a variety of things, it can change.
5045	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, meaning they require one certain food and environment to survive. Pythons are generalists, who aren't very specific in what they eat. This means that they can adapt very easily to new environments, whereas, specialists cannot.
5050	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that their food sources (bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively) exists only in certain areas of the world and so those animals exist only where those food sources are. They are specialists, and are favored by stability. They are different from a python in the the python can eat a variety of food sources around the world so it can exist in many different places.
5051	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China can basically only live in China because they only really eat bamboo and can only survive in China. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves and can only survive in Australia where there are eucalyptus trees. Pythons can eat practically anything and live in a variety of different areas, """" A USGS map showed a potential python habitat nothing from calltah to deleware """" This shows that pythons can live almost anywhere."""
5064	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat certain foods. """"A specialist is China's panda, which...eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. (A chen bach 5).

5069	3	2	2	"""Pandas are both similar because on the article it talks about them being """"specialist"""" and how they solely survive on one food sources. Panda has bamboo while koalas has eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist and can live in different warm environments and as the article said rat, mice, aligator and anything in between."""
5079	3	2	2	Pandas in China as well as koalas in Australia, are specialists who have an incredibly slim range of food. They therefore have trouble adapting. Pythons on the other hand, are generalists and can easily adapt to foreign places, as they have in Florida and other places in the U.S.
5102	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists, because """" what favors specialists is stability """" ( paragraph23). The eat one thing exclusively. Pythons, however are generalists. They can eat a variety of things, and there for can live in many places. Generalists like pythons adapt better than specialists like pandas and koalas."""
5104	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both only eat one type of food each. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, which can adapt to eating the native species, unlike the panda or koala
5109	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat almost nothing but 1 thing,m for pandas:bamboo, koalas;eucalyptus leaves: so if they moved to a different environment they couldnt adapt/survive. They differ from pythons, because pythons could adapt and eat anything.
5110	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. Both of these animals however are different from pythons. Pandas that live in China eat almost nothing but bamboo. Koalas in Australia eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat a variety of food, and can live in the U.S from Cali to Delaware in the southern half. Pandas and koalas are specialists because they eat and adapt very well to other environments. Pythons are specialists because they can adapt.
5113	3	2	2	Pandas in China are more likely to survive in China because their main food source, bamboo is found in China. This is similar to the Australian koala bear who, according to the article, eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. The python is different from both of these animals because the python can inhabit a climate similar to those found in Asia and be able to survive and repopulate.
5114	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because of their classification as a specialist species. The article sides that these animals are specialists because they eat almost exclusively are species. What a python is however, is a generalist. The article claims that generalists not only eat in wide range of food but they also can live in various areas and adapt very quickly to change. Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, and that's why they are different from pythons.
5117	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas only have one type of food they can eat. While the python will eat almost anything, which means it can survive almost any where unlike the panda that need bamboo to eat or koalas which need eucalyptus leaves. These foods don't grow every where.
5131	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they're both specialist species. Both are specific on food source and climate and would have trouble adapting anywhere    else but there native habitat, unlike generalists. """"A generalist is a raccoon, a python, cockroach, white tailed dear....they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.."""" (paragraph 21)."""
5133	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are both specialist species, meaning they need very specific conditions, climate and habitat to flourish. As the text says pandas eat """"almost nothing but bamboo"""" and the koala """"eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""" On the other hand, pythons are classified as a generalist species, able to live in a wider range of habitats and live off of a wider range of food sources , whether in Asia of the U.S. The main difference here is ability to survive in our quickly changing world: the generalists (python) hold a huge advantage over the specialists (panda and koala.)"""
5151	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist. They both very little and they don't eat meat. In the article it says that pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. A python is different from this because they are generalist. Pythons will eat anything if they need to and in the article it says that they can live almost anywhere.
5152	3	2	2	"""Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are very similar because they are both specialists, and they limit their food in take to one source. As stated in the article the Chinese panda """"eats almost nothing but bamboo"""" and the Australian koala bear """"eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Because of this they are limited to specific regions, which is different from the python which eats everything from rat to alligators."""
5159	3	2	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist which means that they favor stability. You can see that both those animals are not use to change because they both stick to the same food source, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost excusively. Panda's an koalas are different from pythons. Pythons are generalist. Generalist favor change unlike pandas are koalas pythons can adapt to various climates.
5163	3	2	2	The panda in China and the koala from Australia are both considered specialists. This is because in order to survive they need a stable environment. The panda eats only bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. This differs from the python which is a generalist. The python doesn't need only one thing to live off of because it is able to adapt.
5168	3	2	2	Just like koala bears in Australia, panda bears are specialists, this means they can easily adapt to only a certain type of environment and they eat mostly one type of food. China's panda ''eats almost nothing but bamboo'' and Australia's koala bear ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively''(pg 5). These animals are both different from pythons because pythons eat a variety of foods and can live in many types of environments. Thus pythons are generalists, not specialists.
5175	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both specialists. In the text it says, """"A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. """"Pandas and koalas have a limited area they can live. Pythons on the other hand are generalists, and can adapt to change easily. The main difference between specialists and generalists is that one can adapt and one cannot."""
5190	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are similar because the article says that are """"specialist"""" since they basically only eat one type of food and would probably not be able to survive in other habitats. Pythons, on the other hand, can be considered generalist since the article says that they have adapted to the Everglades environment, so they can basically live anywhere thats warm enough so they are different than pandas + koalas."""
5204	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia depend on mostly one type of food source. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo & the koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore if they were to be placed somewhere else, in another area it would be hard for them to survive. Pythons on the other hand that are moved from their native area will try and consume any animal to survive, like the python in Everglades region that was found swallowing an alligator.
5207	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both ca only live there due to the envlromet. Pandas eat bamboo which is very a bundat in China, and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves which are very abundat in Austraila. That is any for f them live here. Now a python aresn't live off one food, so it can live anywhere and splecd.
5211	3	2	2	Chinese pandas and Australian koala bears are similar because they are specialists. According to the article, they each eat almost exclusively one type of plant and can survive where those plants grow. Pythons are different because they are generalists, and can survive in many different areas because they have a wide variety of food sources.
5216	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koala bears, because they eat exclusively the Panda with bamboo the Koala with eucalyptus leaves. This is different from pythons because they tend to eat anything. On page 5 it mentions that a python swallowed an alligator whole.
5221	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar in how they eat panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons are different because they will eat almost anything to stay alive. They are informing for endangered species in the Florida bays.
5223	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because """"China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo"""" and """"Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""" They both like to eat certain food. China's panda and Australia's koala are different from a python because pythons eat other animals. For example """"a python swallowed an alligator,"""""""

They are similar because they both only eat a very small range of foods, they are specialists. The pythons is a generalist. It is different because it eats a huge range of animals, basically whatever is there and only needs the right climate, not the same food everywhere."""
5227	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they adapt the same and they both eat mainly one meal. A panda eats bamboo, and th koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons because pythons tend to eat various things such as rats, and in that one case, an alligator. The also move they habita and often.
5228	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists which means that they have to have a certain food source and habitat. This differ from pythons because they are generalists and can eat anything and adapt almost everywhere.
5267	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because the both stick to one source of food and they live in one area. They are different from a python because pythons can live in a bunch of different climates and they eat different foods.
5282	3	2	2	According to the article pandas in china are alike to koalas in Australia because there food source can be found in only one part of the world so they live in that part only unless in captivity. There specialist while pythons are generalist meaning they can survive in many different parts of the world not just one place.
5283	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They survive on thing thing (pandas bamboo, koalas leaves). While a python is a generalist who has multiple food sources and can live in many places. paragraph 21 is a good example """"A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo""""."""
5289	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. The python can live almost anywhere and eat a variety of things. Pandas can only eat, """"nothing but bamboo"""", and koalas can only,"""" eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""
5293	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists animals. There are not a lot of them and they both only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo, while Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals are different from pythons because pythons are abundant and will eat anything that they can get their rangs into. They are generalists.
5307	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both considered specialists compared to the pythons who is a generalist. The article says that specialists prefer stability (the panda and koala both feed almost entirely off a single food) while generalists are more suited to change. A snake is able to adapt better than a koala or panda bear.
5311	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. They both usually only eat one kind of food: bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. If these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die. This is not like pythons, however pythons when given a mild to warm climate to live in, will adapt to the in surrounding and food would not a factor, As long as there are animals in their environment, pythons will have food. However pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates.
5330	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar to pandather because the are exclusive to their habitats. pandas only live in China because of the bamboo and koalas line in Australia because they only eat the eucalyptus leaves. Both are different from pythons because pythons can adapted to different enviornments and food. An example would be how the pythons were introduced to Florida.
5335	3	2	2	"""Panda's and koalas are surprisingly similar species. This is because they're specialist. They are limited to a particular region of the world because of their diet. While pythons are different because they're generalist, they can exist in a variety of environments because they can adapt. """"What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"""" (Achenbanch5). In conclusion, pandas and koalas differ from pythons."""
5337	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koala in Australia because they both only eat food type of food in their natural habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons just need to have  the right climate to survive  and they will adapt to the different food. For example Pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything.
5341	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas bears in Australia are similar in that they are both specialist species. This means they are restricted to limited environments and only eat one type of food. As a result, these animals are less capable of adapting. A python however, is much more flexible. It is a generalist species better suited for survival. It is different also because it can live in different climates and eats different things.
5352	3	2	2	The similarity between pandas in China and koalas in Australia is that they are a specialists, they for example only eat a certain type of food. While generalists adapt and can eat multiple types of food. Both of these animals are different to pythons is because they can not live without bamboo or eucalyptus leaves, while pythons can eat anything.
5358	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are both specialists. Their food source is only found in their home place so adapting to other places would be extremely hard. Pythons on the other hand can adapt to anywhere because they can eat a lot of different things they have been adapting to the U.S.
5366	3	2	2	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are both similar. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because of the fact that they both eat only one type of food. They are different from a python because a python eats alot of things. One python was caught eating an alligator and a Key largo wood rat.
5375	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are extreme specialists. The panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves. This means that they can not live in a lot of places. This is different from a python. A python is a generalist. There fore it can survive in a variety of places. It has several food sources such as the key largo wild rat or even alligators. Pythons can live in many places but koala and panda have special needs.
5382	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas eat only one thing. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons would probably eat any animal that it sees. An example from the article is ''in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator''
5391	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are considered a specialist species, meaning they are only found in one area and eat rarely anything else but one thing. They are different from the python because it is a generalist species, one that can be found in a variety of places and eats many different things.
5410	3	2	2	A panda in China is similar to a koala in Australia because they are both specialists. A panda eats nothing but bamboo and an Australian koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. Neither of them could survive where their food isn't supplied. They both differ from pythons because a phython is a generalist who can live in at least one-third of the United States. A python doesn't just have to live in one location.
5419	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they are specialist species. As it says in the article pandas eat almost exclusively bamboo and live only in china and koalas eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves and live only in Australia. These are both different from pythons generalist species because pythons eat from different foods and can live in many different places or climate with a certain range of conditions.
5423	3	2	2	"""Pandas from China and koala from Australia are very similar in the sense that they are both """"specialist"""". These animals earns """"stability"""" in life, they live of basics that surround them. However they are very different from pythons because pythons are """"Generalists"""", they favor change. Pythons can live where ever the climate is right and quickly adapt to it. If you took a panda or koala out of it natural habitat they would most likely die. On the other hand a python would prosper and build off life from there."""
5429	3	2	2	Pandas in China are panda's in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Pythons are different because they are generalists unlike the specialists and things that and abundant to their locations. The bamboo and eucalyptus, generalists can eat anything mostly. This means specialists have to stay in their natural habitat, while generalists can move around and live anywhere.
5430	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are both similar because they can only survive in certain areas. As the author says, """"China's panda which eats mostly but bamboo. Koala which eats eucalyptus,"""" Both species are diffrent from the python, though because they can't easily adapt. The python can adapt and eat almost anything while the panda and koala can only eat one type of food."""
5432	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both speciaslists. The two species only feed on particular foods found in their region and would not be able to adapt to different places. Both panadas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and therefore able to survive in many different places and climates.

5459	3	2	2	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. They both only eat one food which is mainly found in their homelands so it would be hard for them food just anywhere else but pythons, the articles says, they are a different story. As long as the climate is right, they can adjust and find food.
5472	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they do not favor change a basically eat one food a day. They differ from the python because it can deal with change and eat almost any animals such as the crocodile. The python also differs because it can live anywhere throughout the world as long as the climate is right, when pandas and koalas need it to be similar to what their used too.

However pythons are generalists because they adapt and eat almost anything and can live almost anywhere."""
5490	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. They have a very special diet, panda-bamboo and koala eucalyptus leaves, so they couldn't be able to adapt elsewhere. They are very different to pythons which are generalists. They can adapt to many surroundings and foods. Pythons will eat many things while pandas and koalas eat only one type of things.
5493	3	2	2	Pandas in china eat bamboo almost exclusively while koalas eat only eucalyptus.They are both considered specialists who need to eat limited foods or live in a unique environment. Pythons on the other hand can live in a wide range of places like a third of the US alone.
5500	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are like koalas in Australia because they are both considered """"specialists"""" as they cannot naturally live anywhere else in the world aside from China or Australia respectively due to their specific diets of """"nothing but bamboo"""" and """"eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""".

5535	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. As the article said, they eat only one kind of food, and live in only one place. This makes them different from pythons, which have proven themselves to be generalists, which were, originally from Asia. However, once introduced here, they can survive and thrive in the southern U.S.
5551	3	2	2	"""A Panda from China is similar to a Koala because they both really on one food source.

5565	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koala bear both only eat plants. The pandas eat bamboo and the koala bear eats only eucalyptus leaves. Unlike these two animals a python will eat anything it can fit it's mouth around or at least attempt to. A python will eat anything from a key largo wood rat to a common house pet. In the Everglades in a very rare case a python attempted to eat a alligator and exploded. Pythons are a danger to other species unlike pandas and koala bears who only eat plants.
5567	3	2	2	"""A panda and koala are specialists because they both only eat one thing. """" which eats almost nothing but bamboo ...eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""" the can't survive off anything else, but a python can eat a large variety of foods, and survive in many different locations, it is a generalist."""
5579	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both require certain foods found in their specific area that is hard to find in other places. These two furry animals differ from pythons, not only in appearance. Pythons are generalist, meaning they van pretty much survive anywhere where there is a warm climate and they do not need one specific food to survive like specialist do.
5583	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are specialist species. According to the articles they each have specific diets. Pandas mostly eat just bamboo, and koalas generally only eat eucalyptus leaves. In contrast, pythons are of a generalist species, since they have a much more varied diet and climate tolerance. As a result, pythons and other generalist species thrive in this day and age.
5606	3	2	2	"""Koalas and pandas are similar because they are both specialists. According to the article, specialists are better with stability. The koala and panda eat the same food always and live in the same habitat constantly while a python, a generalist, can change and adapt even when  """"man kind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place."""
5613	3	2	2	pandas and koalas are similer in that they are both specialists and require very specific food sources like bamboo and eucalysts leaves (achenbach 2). They are both diffrent from pythons in that pythons have a universal and adaptable diet, unlike the panda and koala whos diet limit its movement, it can adopt and live manny places. It is a generalist.
5627	3	2	2	A panda is similar to a koala because it only eats one thing, bamboo. However a koala eats eucalyptus leaves. This differs from a python which has a broader diet which is why it can survive in more places. I can also tell that a python can eat different things because, swallowed an alligator. Also, the article states, ''you could probaly have pythons snacking up the Pitmeas river.''
5633	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both examples of specialists. They require a specific lifestyle, such as a diet or environment. Specialists favor stability. On the other hand a python is a generalist who can adapt to different conditions.They don't mind changes as much as a panda or koala would. Also pythons are considered to be an ''invasive'' species by some.
5639	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists & can only eat one type of food. According to the article Chinese pandas """"eat almost nothing but bamboo"""" and Australian koalas """"eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.""""

5645	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because both are because both are exclusive to their own habitats, and both animals have strict dids. They are different from pythons because pythons live in many places, and they eat a large variety of food. An example of this was when the python ate the alligator.

A specialist; biologically speaking is an organism that has a set food source that they hardly hardly stray from. Generalists like pythons and """"arguably human beings """"(pg5) are organisms that have a variety in their diet. These organisms can adapt overtime to change what they eat. Specialists however will not."""
5670	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they can only survive with very specific conditions and ''what favors specialist is stability.'' Pandas are specialists because they pretty much only eat bamboo, which grows in China, likewise the koala bear only eats eucalyptus leaves, which are is Australia. Pythons are different because they are generalist, meaning they can survive different conditions.
5674	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are specialist species because they survive aft at a single food source, limiting there habitat to were that groups. Pythons on the other hand, are a generalist species and can survive in many different areas from many different food sources.
5686	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are specialist species. They both eat one particular thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves without these food source these two animals will not be able to survive. koalas and pandas are different from pythons because pythons are generalist species. They eat anything from large animals to small, birds other reptiles, etc. They can survive anywhere.
5688	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Pandas only eat bamboo, and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, pythons are able to adapt to new environments, such as those of southern USA. Specialists, however, unlike generalists cant adapt to new environments because they rely on something only in their environments.
5700	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat the same food and live in the same place each day, venturing away would be likely death, they stay in one area. They are both different from pythons because pythons can live in many different places and their diet is widespread.
5713	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in australia because both species are considered specialists. Pandas eat almost only bamboo, and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Both species have very specific needs fro survival, unlike generalists. Generalists, such as the python, are able to live in a broader range of environments and adapt well to change.
5719	3	2	2	Pandas in  China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both specialists animals. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist animal. Arguably this animal can live anywhere and can eat a variety of things.
5725	3	2	2	Pandas and koala's are both specialist species. They only eat one type of food. Bamboo for the panda, and eucalyptus leaves for the koala. A python is a generalist species. It can live anywhere and eat just about anything. Pandas and koalas can only live in their natural habitats.
5730	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar because they both mainly eat one thing that is abundant in their habitat. Pandas eat almost only bamboo which they can easily find in China wildlife koala bears mainly eat eucalyptus leaves, which is widely available to them in Australia. Pythons are different because they are carnivores and don't only thing on one thing. According to the article, pythons can eat anything from mice to alligator.
5731	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are specialist species. They specify to one type of substance that is crucial to their survival that without they could possibility die. The python is a generalist species, meaning that they have a larger range of adaptation. This means  they can survive on more than one food source like different types of rodent rather than specifically one and one only.
5756	3	2	2	The panda's and koala's are similar because they are both specialist species eating almost exclusivly one form of plant type and they are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist species eating almost any animals it can so it is not limited to one habitat or region.
5762	3	2	2	Panda in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. Pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptis. This makes it hard for the m to survive anywhere else. They are different form pythons because pythons are generalist. Pythons can eat, really anything and live anywhere making survival easy.
5771	3	2	2	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are alike because they are both specialists. They both mainly eat one type food that is found in their habitat. On the other hand, pythons are generalists. They eat whatever they can find. In the article it states that generalists can live anywhere that is the main difference.
5774	3	2	2	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they can only live in a certain environment and only eat certain food, it says in the article pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. Whereas, a python can adapt to any environment it is put in and it is able to eat anything.
5782	3	2	2	Both the Chinese panda and Australia koala are similar because they are both specialists, which means they live off one main food source. The panda lives on a diet off bamboo, and the koala mainly consumes eucalyptus leaves. But these animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist, which has many food sources. The python will eat rodents, small animals, or even large animals.
5784	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only live in those areas because they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus. They are specialist. Pythons however are generalist because they can eat rats, bugs and other things so they can live in different places.
5786	3	2	2	"""Pandas and kaola bear are similar in that they are both specialist species and exclusively belong to a certain area and almost exclusively eat one thing. Evidence to prove so is """"China's panda eat's almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear eats's eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""". This indicates that do share similarities, but also differ from python, in that the python can eat almost and adapt to conditions similar to its an."""
5792	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialist which means they have a very limited amount of places they can survive due to their diet.Both of these species only conseve  a very specific food which exist only in specific places. Making them need to only live in one area. This differs from a python a generalists who can consume a large variety of foods , so it can live many places.
5807	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are specialized animals who have particular dietary needs. They can only survive if the conditions and food is right. Pythons diet is more general and can be changed if need be and therefore is a generalized animal that can thrive in may locations.
5808	3	2	2	The China panda eats only bamboo, and Australia's koala bear usually eats only eucalyptus leaves. So, they're alike because they eat only one food. They also, cant leave their habitat because that's were their food is. Unlike a python, it can live anywhere because it eats a lot of different things.
5809	3	2	2	They are both similar because they both only eat one thing. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas era eucalyptus leaves. A python will eat anything. In 2005 a python swallowed an alligator. It exploded, but it still tried to eat it. They eat only meat while the koala and panda do not eat only meat. As long as a python is hungry enough it will clearly resort to any food source.
5826	3	2	2	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar in the way that they only eat things that come from their natural habitat, they are different from the python because the python can live in other places and adapt to the food resources that come from there.
5829	3	2	2	Pandas In China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species, animals needing stability and little change in their lives. Pandas eat mostly bamboo, and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because they are a generalist species. Pythons are able to adapt to changes in enviroment, location, and food supply unlike pandas & koalas.
5830	3	2	2	"""Pandas and Koalas are both specialist. A panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo has to stay in its own habitat. Much like the Koala """"which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""" These two animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists.

5831	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears because there both specialist. Panda's in China only eat bamboo and kolas from Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves. There both different from a python because a python is a generalist which could possibly live anywhere a eat a variety of things.
5835	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia  because both species rely on basically one source of nutrients. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two animals are different from pythons, because pythons have abundant sources of foods unlike the panda bear. Pythons can almost eat anything. A dramatic situation that happened in the Everglades in, 2005, was that a python swallowed an alligator.
5839	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are """"specialist"""" species. They only eat certain types of food, so they are limited to certain environments. Pythons are different because they are a """"generalist"""" species. They can adapt to different environment and the food they eat is more common worldwide."""
5844	3	2	2	Animals have been divided into two sections; specialists and generalists. Robray MacInnes distinguishes between the the two by saying that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability. The Chinese panda and the Australian koala are two specialist species. They rely on one exclusive food source. The python, a generalist, is extremely adaptive and is not roled to one single food supply.
5860	3	2	2	China's panda is similar to Australias koala because these two animals are specialist species. These two specific place and only eat one specific food; compared to a python which is a generalist species that can adapt to other ranges throughout the U.S and eat a variety of different foods.
5861	3	2	2	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both can live off of one thing and only in that area. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears. Those animals differ from pythons because pythons can eat a variety of different animals and can live almost anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.
5862	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist and eat plants that grow in one area. Pythons can live in more places than pandas or koalas because they can eat mainly panda and are going to new places to live like U.S.
5870	3	2	2	Panda's and koalas are both specialists. That means they can not adapt well because they only eat pretty much one thing such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. Pythons however can adapt  and find food, and are therefore generalists. An example of a python adapting is in Florida, where they can eat Key Largo wood rats and other species.
5876	3	2	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both belong to the specialist group,due to their very limited diet and inability to adapt to most places.This contrasts them from pythons because pythons can adapt to most environments due to the variety of food they eat.
5877	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the same  that they are both specialist species. This meaning that they generally only eat one type of food, as described in paragraph 21. They both differ from a python because a python is able to move easily adapt to several different foods because it is a generalist species.
5880	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists and eat exclusively from one food source. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and the koala eats nothing, but eucalyptus leaves. They are different then the python because pythons are generalists. Because they can pretty much eat what ever they want. They have even eaten an alligator, before and they can live more place where the panda and koala cannot.
5885	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both have limited diets, which makes them unable to live in a different territory because the food they eat is only found in their original habitat. They are different from pythons """"because pythons only require a warm environment, which can be provided for them in other places."""
5890	3	2	2	Koala bears and panda bears are similar because they both eat exclusively one thing and nothing else. They are also specialists. A python is a generalist, they eat many different things and don't have to live in only one area to get their food.
5896	3	2	2	"""Panda's and koala's are similar. In the text it says, """"A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""" This means to me that both species have a certain type of food they eat. They eat only this type of food. In the text it says, """"A python swallowed an alligator..."""" Obviously, pythons don't eat only one food. This is the difference between panda's and koala's from pythons."""
5898	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists that need specific things to survive. For example, pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. These are different pythons because pythons are generalists that can easily adapt to other areas as long as there is a similar climate. They are not limited on food like pandas and koalas are.
5899	3	2	2	"""The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because according to the article paragraph 21-23 it explains how pandas only eats bamboo, and koala bear eats eucalyptus they leaves almost exclusively.

That is why panda and koala are extinct."""
5905	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia, are specialist animals; they live in the places they do because it has the food it needs to survive. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They need these specific things to survive. The python however is a generalist it can live anywhere because its able to adapt to its surroundings.
5921	3	2	2	Panda's and kolas are similar by both eating certain foods like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and thats how they are both specialist.

5948	3	2	2	Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are similar b/c they both depend on their environment to survive. pandas consume bamboo which grows naturally only in China. Koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves which grow natural in Australia.

Joel Achaboch writes """"China's panda, which etas almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""" (One Man's Pet, Another's Invasive Species). Without these specific foods, a panda and koala would die. However, a python can eat many different foods and/can live anywhere on the planet that suits it's climate needs."""
5961	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are specialists because they eat almost exclusively one type of food such as pandas eat the bamboo and  koalas eating eucalyptus leaves. Both of these species differ from pythons because pythons are generalists which eat many different things, which is why they adapt so easily to other places even though it is foreign to them.
5962	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala bears in Australia because both animals are specialists. They basically eat only one thng which means there aren't to many envirnments that they could live in. These animals are different from a python because a python is a generalist. Pythons eat a variety of things and can adapt in different evirnments.
5968	3	2	2	The pandas in China only eat bamboo and the koalas in Australia mainly eat eucalyptus leaves while pythons are adapting to new environment and eating what ever comes a long. The difference between the animals and the reptiles are that the koalas and pandas are not spreading and adapting to different environments while the pythons are.
5997	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both similar because they are specialists or only eat a very limited variety in foods. Pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they are less picky in their food choices. Pythons can adapt to many different environment and eat a variety of foods.
6002	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists while pythons are generalists. Pandas and koalas are also similar in the fact that they eat one thing, almost exclusively pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons, on the other hand, eat a variety of food; rats, other rodents, and even tried to eat an alligator, but it exploded in the process. Pandas and koalas also are confined to one part of the world, while pythons are now in many.
6014	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both described in this article as ''specialist'' species meaning they need very specific aspects of their lives to be fulfilled in order to survive. An example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo. Both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are ''generalists'', not ''specialist''. Pythons can live in a wider variety of places and eat a vast selection of  prey, where as the panda and koala cannot.
6022	3	2	2	In China, the pandas diet consist of bamboo and in Australia the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. If the panda or koala were placed somewhere else they would  not have the food they need in order to survive. A python is more adaptable. It can eat common animals like birch and dents. A pythons diet consists of almost anything it can fit in its mouth.
6028	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, as they are both specialists. This means that they only eat one type of food making it harder for them to adapt to new climates. There specialists greatly differ from pythons b/c pythons can adapt easier, as they can survive by eating almost anything. Animal similar to pythons,racroans and cockroaches are called generalists as they eat a wider variety of food and can survive almost changing conditions.
6045	3	2	2	Both the Chinese pandas and Australia koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalist. Chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while Australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too. Pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human. Generalists are more capable of adapting to change in diet and environment thus making them more able to survive and reproduce more effectively.
6052	3	2	2	China's Panda is similar to Australia's Koala because they both only live on one main food. The panda mainly eats bamboo as the Koala maily eat eucalyptus leaves. These 2 animals differ from pythons because they are considered specialists as pythons are generalists. A specialist can only live in one place where as a generalist can live almost anywhere.
6060	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in the way that they only eat one type of food. They are specialists, which can only survive in certain areas that can support their diet and lifestyle. Pythons, meanwhile can eat just about anything that they can get their claws on. They are generalists, and they can usually adapt to any change in their immediate environment as long as its similar to its natural environment.
6077	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist animals,which  means that they eat, almost exclusively, one specific type of food and can only live in one area. Whereas, pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything. Therefore, they can live in many areas and are called generalists.
6085	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they could only survive in those places. In the article it says China's panda eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because they are spread all over the world in warm climates because they eat anything.
6086	3	2	2	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia. Both eat one food almost exclusively - the pandas eat bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves - and stay confined to their overseas environments. Pythons, on the other hand, are different. They are reptiles, and they are generalists as opposed to the others, who are specialists.Pythons can live in a variety of climates and eat a variety of foods.
6096	3	2	2	Pandas from China and Koalas from Australia are quite similar in the fact that they can only eat food from one source and, therefor, can only live in one environment. They are different from pythons however, because pythons are more invasive and can adapt easily to new diets.
6114	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist, which means they both eat mainly one type of food. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus eaves for koalas. Pythons however are generalists, meaning they eat almost anything. The main difference between pandas, pythons, and koalas is that pandas and koalas can not live outside their natural habitat because they would starve, but pythons can live anywhere and still find food.
6116	3	2	2	"""Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are both specialist, needing stability, the mainfood source they eat, and to not have change as explained in paragraph 21.

6125	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, they are specialist organisms. They cannot move from their native land, China an Australia, because they can only live off of that environment's climate and food source. Pythons are different because they are generalists. They are capable of moving around to different environments. Pythons have been seen in many different places.
6126	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koalas are similar because they both are picky eaters. Koalas eat pretty much only eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat bamboo. These two differ from pythons becuse pythons will eat any kind of meat or animals. They eat rats, mice, beck one try'd to eat a crocodile.
6130	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in one type of habitat, because for example the panda only eats bamboo and the Koala only eats eucalyptus leaves the python, however is a generalist species. So it can live in a wide variety of places, such as Asia and the U.S.
6131	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas have specific dietary needs, and need to stay in an environment where there is an abundance of this food. Pandas need bamboo and koalas need eucalyptus leaves, Unlike the python which can eat any other animal. The python is a generalist and would have an easier time living anywhere compared to pandas and koalas which are specialists.
6132	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are alike. They are alike because they are both specialist. They cannot survive in locations without bamboo or eucalyptus, which they eat. If they were transported to America, they would die in our wilderness. A python is different. A python is a generalist. They can live in a larger variety of places like Asia or the southern parts of the United States. This can lead to pythons becoming invasive species, as they have no predators in their new environment. A panda cannot become an invasive species.

This shows that both animals are specialists because they wouldn't survive in most environments. Both are different from pythons because, pythons are generalists, who can live in most climates."""
6239	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia only eat one food. Mainly pandas eat bamboo and koalas almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat just about any other creatures they can get a hold of one tried to eat a crocodile, but exploded when swallowed.
6240	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists. In the article it states they are specialists because they favor stability and both eat only one food for the most part. Pythons are different because they are generalist, which the article says, are those who change favors, because generalists adapt to change well.
6247	3	2	2	Both Pandas and Koalas are specialists species so they can only survive in certain ares. They also both only eat one food. Pandas eat bamboo one Koalas ear eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generous so they can survive in changing environment and can eat different types of food.
6254	3	2	2	Pandas in China area similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They require a specific type of food. For example, a panda only eats,bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. This is different from the pythons because the python is a generalist. It is able to eat many different things and can live easily among humans while specialist cannot.

6280	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they both exclusively eat one item. Panda bears eat only bamboo and koala's exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist and can live mainly anywhere and eat almost anything.
6316	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists. They eat only one thing; pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists. Generalists eat more than one type of food and can adapt to the environment around them.
6321	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists, they survive on a very specific food source and a specific environment. However, pythons are generalists in that they don't require a specific food source and climate to survive. Subsequently, pythons can spread much farther than pandas and koalas.

6354	3	2	2	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They eat the same foods day in and day out and they have a limited range in which to live. Both of these animal are different from pythons, though, pythons are generalists much like us humans. Pythons can adapt to change and can live in numerous environments. On the other hand, pandas and koalas can do no such thing.
6361	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat mainly one thing and not a variety of foods. They're both considered specialists because the article claims that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons on the other hand, can eat several different animals and not just one like pandas and koalas. The article shows that pythons catch rats, alligators and more!
6365	3	2	2	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists species that can only live on the food that is in those areas bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for the koala where as the pythons are generalist species that can eat just about nothing and live just about anywhere.
6366	3	2	2	The two are similar because pandas and koalas are animals that have a specific food. A python does not and seems to be able to adapt better to it's surrounding. Pythons have proven to be able to leave home but the koala and panda must have bamboo or eucalyptus leaves to survive.
6405	3	2	2	Panda in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists which according to the article,need stability for example, pandas live off of mostly bamboo and Koalas live almost exclusively off of eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons, generalists who have been able to adapt to the food sources and different parts of the world.

6410	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They can not live anywhere, because pandas need bamboo and koalas need eucalyptus leaves to eat. Without these they will starve. These are both different from pythons because a python can live anywhere, as long as the climate is the right temperature. This is because they can eat anything even an alligator if they need to.

6430	3	2	2	Panda's from China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialists. A specialist is an animal that can only live one way and only eat one thing. Pandas can only eat bamboo, and koalas can only eat eucalyptus leaves. Now the snake is different because it is a generalist. A generalist is an animal that can adapt. It can live in various places and eat various things.
6441	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both similar mainly because they both depend on a single food source like bamboo and eucalyptus. Pythons however can travel anywhere with the right climate wild small preys so it can adapt better to a new place.
6448	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat and survive off of one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo, and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Both pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything. The article even said that one python swallowed an alligator before; then it exploded.
6458	3	2	2	Panda's and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. They both eat exclusively one thing. The panda eats bamboo, the koala eats eucalptis trees. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. The eat anything from alligators to mite.
6460	3	2	2	Pandas in China only eat bamboo which is only found in certain Asian countrys. Koala bears in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves which are only found in few parts of the world. If you take a panda or koala out of it's habitat then it won't survive unlike pythons which eat mice which are found anywhere.
6494	3	2	2	Pandas in China and bamboo in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They both only eat a certain food and therefore can only live in certain places. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, the opposite of specialists, unlike specialists generalists live in warmer areas and aren't limited to one food.
6507	3	2	2	Pandas from China & koalas from Australia are similar in that they are both specialists, eating exclusively one food. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists who can live in more than one place because they eat more than 1 thing.
6518	3	2	2	Pandas & Koalas are very much alive, because both animals only eat one thing either bamboo or eucalyptus leaves these differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide variety of food, food mice to alligators. This makes python generalists & pandas and koalas specialists.
6528	3	2	2	"""Chinese pandas, which eat, only bamboo and Australian koalas, which eat eucalyptus leaves, are considered """" specialists"""" by this article that is, they need specific things to survive in a given place.

Pythons in Asia inhabit climates like that of the u.s says the article."""
6529	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists animals. They rely on one food source and cannot live without it. They are different from a python because a python is a generalist and can adapt to a new environment and survive by eating different foods.
6530	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists, meaning they need specific climates and environments to survive. Pandas and koalas reguire specific food only found in ther homelands of China and Australia. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, meaning they can survive in a wider range of environments than species such as pandas and koalas.
6534	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals. In the article, Achenbach states that """"A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves..."""" (5). These two animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalist animals who have a wide range of food and habitats to live in."""
6535	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are forced to stay in their habitats (China and Australia, respectively) because they need certain things to survive. What they eat is not available all round the world, so they have to stay in their natural habitat. However, pythons can move from continent to continent, because they are able to adapt and eat other things. This is exemplalory in, ''...there's a speculation that Hurricane Andrew...played a factor in a wholesale python jail break in 1992.'' They were able to adapt, unlike pandas and koalas.
6536	3	2	2	"""As stated in paragraph 21, both pandas and koalas are known as specialist because they can only exist in a specific area that holds/grows their source of food. While these animals share this lifestyle in common, the python contrasts them. The python, on the other hand, can spread anywhere with a suitable climate, thus making it more of a generalist. Because pythons are often """"around humans"""", they are more """"abundant"""" than pandas or koalas, as stated in paragraph 20."""
6541	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, they eat, respectively, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, almost exclusively. They are unlike pythons, which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators.
6557	3	2	2	Pandas & koalas both have specialized diets. Climats, making it difficult to survive in a variety of areas. Koalas for example eat almost exclusively eucalyptus leaves, wile python can eat just about anything and live just about anywhere (their habitat and food).
6559	3	2	2	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they are both specialist species that live off mostly one food and thrive in only a certain area of the world. They are different from the python because a python is a generalist species that can adapt to rapid change in food sources and habitats. Unlike pandas and koalas. Pythons live all over the world.
6568	3	2	2	the author describes pandas and koala bears as specialists while pythons are generalists. Both pandas and koalas eat one food exclusively. Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus. Pythons however, can eat nearly anything and are capable of surviving in more than one place. Pandas and koala bears must remain where they can get the right food.
6569	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both specialists. These two animals rely and single species food sorce to survive, and are different from the python because this animal is a generalist, meaning it will change its food source as it travels to different envroments.
6581	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both have very strict diets-which restrains them from leaving their natural habitat and makes them specialists. They are both different from pythons (generalists) because pythons have been found to live in a variety of climate due to their broader acceptable food range. Also, pythons do well around humans, allowing them to live as pets.
6583	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because, they are both specialists. They both eat a specific thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while on the other hand a python also known as a generalist, eats just about anything. and can adapt. If you put a panda somewhere there weren't bamboo then it would probably die but if put a python anywhere it would probably survive.
6584	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they're both specialists China's panda exclusively eats bamboo and Australia's Koalas exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. These two Animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists that can live almost anywhere and adapt to eating types of food.
6614	3	2	2	Like it in the article, Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia differ from pythons in many ways. Pandas and Koalas are specialized species, they only live in certain areas and eat certain foods. While pythons can eat only thing and live practically anywhere, they are generalized.
6619	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists which relies on specific food sources and would not be able to survive in most other places in the world. The article states, ''China's panda (eats) almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively'' to show that these animals could not live anywhere in contrast, pythons are generalists which can live anywhere. These organisms are becoming more abundant, as compared to specialists because they favor change.
6629	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive. Their only food source is where they live. They are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere. In the article it says a python lived in a tourist car and due tried to eat an alligator, so they can actually survive.
6639	3	2	2	"""Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. """"China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."""" They can only live in these places because they need what is grown there. A python however, can live anywhere that has a potential food source and an agreeable climate. Python's can eat almost anything that fits in their stomachs but pandas and koalas can't."""
6641	3	2	2	Both the panda and koala are specialists. They require a very specific habitat to live. The have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own. A python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats. It is not restricted to one food source like the panda or the koala, it can find a way to survive if the climate fits it.
6644	3	2	2	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both specialists. They both live off of one food source and could only live in the areas they are from Chunge to their habitats would mean death for them. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can adapt to changing habitats quickly, and eat just about anything. Pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the U.S.
6645	3	2	2	Koalas and Pandas are similar because they are both specialist species having settled in a very specific niche. They could not survive elsewhere because of their highly specific food source. However, both differ from a python which is a generalist species because it is able to move easily adapt to a new habitat, such as the Florida keys and in gludes, neither a panda nor a koala could or would be able to adapt like the python who has expanded its food source to include an alligator.
6650	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are specialist animals. Specialist animals are animal that need a specific enviroment to survive. For example pandas and koalas eat almost only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. Pythons are generalist species meaning they thrive on change. They can potentially live anywhere from humid Florida, to arid Lexas to busy California to even cold Delaware.
6659	3	2	2	The pandas in China are very similar to Australia's koala bear because they are both specialists. Specialists are species that cannot adapt to change very well. According to the article both the panda and koala live on mainly off one main food source. These two species are very different from pythons, which are generalists. Pythons eat rats and alligators now and can live in a large variety of climates,which is unlike koala & pandas.
6667	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they can only survive in a certain area. This is because the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala eats almost only eucalyptus leaves. The python however is different because it is a generalist. They can handle change and adapt to it, making it easy for them to find food almost anywhere.
6670	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia.They are because they are both specialists who cannot live anywhere. For example, pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists which are like us humans who can live/adapt anywhere.

6699	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas and koalas cannot survive just anywhere because pandas eat almost only bamboo and koalas eat almost only eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food. This means they have more places where they can survive.
6709	3	2	2	The panda and koala are both specialists while a python is a generalist. The difference between these two like said in the article is that the python can adapt and change to the environment it is in like humans therefore they can live in more places and thrive. Unlike the python the panda and koala are in need of special types of food to survive, so if moved they would probably die.
6728	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists meaning that they only eat certain kinds of food which also means that they can only live in certain places. Both of these animals are different from a python because pythons are generalists meaning that they eat a wide variety of things, therefore they can survive pretty much anywhere.
6731	3	2	2	Both pandas in China and koala in Australia are, they are both specialists. Both live almost exclusively in one place and eat almost one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. These specialist animals differ from a python. A python is a generalist capable of living in many places and eating many foods.

A Chinese Panda """"eats almost nothing but bamboo."""" and a Koala """"eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"""", this shows how these animals most live in one place.

6738	3	2	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas because according to the article they're both specialists and a panda eats bamboo and a koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They both eat same sort of leaf or plant on the other hand theyre different from a python because a python is a generalist who can live almost anywhere. A panda or a koala cant do this because they need to stay where they know they can get bamboo or the eucalyptus leaves.
6742	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both considered specialists. They both eat a singular plant (Panda eats bamboo, koala eats eucalyptus leaves). They are different from pythons because a python is considered a generalist. It eats multiple things, rats, alligators, and literally anything it can get its mouth over.
6753	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both eat one thing, they do not have a variety of different foods, Panda mainly eat bamboo and Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat many different things. In the everglades in 2005 a python tried eating an aligator and while it was in its stomach it exploded. Koalas and pandas also stay in their natural habitat, pythons have migrated.
6755	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are specialists, meaning they favor stability and they are only able to live in a certain area. For example the article explains how pandas almost only eat bamboo (which grows in China) and how koalas main food are the eucalyptus leaves which grow in Australia. They are both unlike the python because it is a generalist which is able to adapt and live more places than specialists.
6765	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both classified as a specialist species. For example, panda's in China exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas in Australia stick to eucalyptus leaves as their main diet. However, both of these animals are different than the python. Pythons are defined as a generalist species. If a python is moved from its original habitat to one similar it will adapt easily. A python diet is mainly composed of other animals. A python is easier to feed than a panda or koala.
6768	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both require sped food to survive, for instance a panda only eats bamboo and a koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from snakes because snakes can live anywhere in the world because they have no specific food needs that can be found in only one region of the world.
6791	3	2	2	The China's panda and Australia's Koala are both considered a type of bear.They both live off one specific type of food they eat for example , the panda eats bamboo and almost nothing else. The Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. These 2 types of bears plant eaters you could say. The python is a dangerous meat eater ranging from rats to Alligators. The python is far more aggresive and smaller than the two bears.
6800	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists that can only live in one area because of their diet and habitat needs. They are both different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists, and can live in various places. The map of the U.S.A show that they would be able to live in any place in the southern region of the USA . Pandas and koalas would not be able to live in vanas areas.
6801	3	2	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists.The 2 have united diets, such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and the benefits or being a specialist is stability,on the contrally pythons are generalists and can live in a koalas range of locations due to their less restriclae diet and ability change forwadays,people are chasing to make earth a ready changing place and therefore favor generalists since adapt to change.
6803	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they are both specialists- they eat only a specific type of food and so can only survive in a specific habitat. Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can  live many places. This makes them a very effective invasive species, as described in the article.
6804	3	2	2	Pandas in China must live these because they eat bamboo, Koalas in Australia can only live there because they eat eucalyptus plant. These animals both specialist because they can not be removed from their habitat. A python or any other generalist species can survive in many locations , therefore they become invasive species.
6817	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat one main food source ( pandas bamboo koalas eucalyptus leaves ). So they survive best in one stable , non changing environment. However, pythons can live and adapt to new conditions, so they can move to different environments, such as Asia to Florida.
6818	3	2	2	Pandas in China almost exclusively eat bamboo making them a specialists species. Koalas in Australia are also specialists because they almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are diffrent from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere and can thrive on almost any food source.
6821	3	2	2	In the article the author tells us that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Australia's koala bear exclusiusvely eats eucalyptus leaves. Both animals really eat one thing. A python is very different it doesnt eat one thing it swallows its meals there for its very different.
6833	3	2	2	Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. They only flourish and survive in a very specific area. For example, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. However, pythons are generalist species. They can survive almost anywhere. The article states that the species that have become most abundant are those that do best in and around humans.
6834	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both of them can only live off one food source. They cannot live anywhere else because they need that specific thing found only in their enviorment. Pythons however can live off many things, they can live in different enviorments and eat different rats, thats how they live across the world.
6840	3	2	2	The Chinese panda and Australia's koala are both similar because they both eat special type of food. They are both specialists according to the article. Both the Chinese panda and the australian koala are different than python b/c the python is a generalist that can adapt to different food scources.
6847	3	2	2	"""Both koalas (in Australia) and pandas (in China) or """"specialists."""" Specialist have a small range of diet, """"China's panda..eats almost nothing but bamboo (and) Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively are two great examples. Pythons, on the other hand, are generalists, which means they have a greater variety of prey. They are expected to survive better because they don't rely on one single prey."""
6871	3	2	2	As it says in paragraph 21, both the panda and koalas are specialists which means that they both need a certain thing to keep them alive. Pythons on the other hand need a varied climate to adapt quickly to add food sources. This means generalists, like pythons, will throw out specialists because they evolve better.
6875	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They only eat one kind of food which is only in the place that they are native to. They both are different from a python because the python can eat any kind of animal. o if they bad to survive in different places they could because they would have food there.
6880	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist and have mainly one food source. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because unlike pandas and koalas, pythons have a vast variety of food they can eat and they can live anywhere that has the similar climate as asia.
6883	3	2	2	pandas in china are similar to pandas in Australia because they are both specialists. paragraph 21 states that both the species live off of are food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They are different from the python because a python is a generalist, which can adopt to anywhere. Pandas and koalas have to stay in the place to survive.
6886	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both only eat on food source. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus. They are different from the python because if they were to move from there homeland they would survive on varieties of food but pandas and koalas can't do that.
6889	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas can only survive where the plants they eat are, because they won't eat anything else. Pythons can live and thrive in other places because they eat a wide range of animals and survive in a larger climate/environmental range. Pandas/Koalas are specialists, while pythons and humans are generalists.
6898	3	2	2	Pandas are like koalas because the both only eat one thing. Both are also in trouble should their environment change rapidly. They are different from a python because they aren't adaptive. For example, a python can be taken from Asia and moved to America and adapt quickly an easily. If the same was done to the panda or koala it would starve to death.
6908	3	2	2	The panda's and koalas are similar because they are specialists. The article states that both species only eat one type of plant. This shows how they cannot relocate as easily as the python. The python can eat a large variety of food as states in the article. Because of this it can relocate  much easier than the panda or koala.
6912	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists. Pythons are generalists. Pythons can live anywhere and Pandas and Koalas can only live in one place. Pandas eat bamboo in China, koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves in Australia.
6915	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are both specialists. A panda eats almost exclusively bamboo and Koala eats almost nothing else than eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generalists.They can adapt very quickly. They eat a lot of things ranging from mice to something as big as an alligator.
6918	3	2	2	"""Panda in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both specialist species.In the article it says pandas """"eat almost nothing but bamboo"""" (Achenbach).Indicating they could live almost nowhere else while pythons are generalist,meaning they can adapt and live in many climates regions."""
6932	3	2	2	The article explains how pandas in China eat mostly bamboo, and how koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. These speces have very exclusive diets while the pythons eat very different foods, and potentially other animals. An example would be when a key harse wood rat was tracked into the stomach of a python.
6934	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in one location on earth, they also only eat one food source, which makes them specialists. It is harder for specialists to survive because they can only live in one climate, sometimes only with one food source. The python is a generalist and live in a wide range of climates with a large food source, making it easier for them to survive which is why the specialists are different from generalists.
6940	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala bears in Australia because both of them eat vegetation that is native to their country. For example the panda eats bamboo and the koala bear eats eukeoliptus leaves while on the other hand pythons invade other places they can live and eat anything that has meat.
6945	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they're specialist species. They both only live in one part of the world and they have a very specific diet. A panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and a koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost always. They're both different from pythons because in the article it said pythons are generalists. They eat all kinds of things.
6955	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are restrained to their respective regulars because they both eat almost exclusively one food. There, they are unlike the python, which as a generalist, can adapt to many ecosystems and still find a suitable prey. Pandas and koala's are specialists while pythons are generalists.
6956	3	2	2	Both pandas in China and koalas in Australia are specialist species. They both eat almost exclusively one food, bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for the koalas. These two species need those plants to survive. Buy a generalist species like a python, can eat anything. They will try to eat anything, like a aligator, ever if it kills them. Generalist species can adapt and specialist species can't, thats the difference between the two.
6957	3	2	2	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both different from pythons because both pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists. Pandas and koalas each mainly only one food source and the generalists eat many different ones. Living ''in age that loves generalists more than specialists'' put pandas and koalas more as a rare of becoming extinct. Pandas and koalas would need to adapt like pythons and eat more if they don't want to be extinct.
6960	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are similar because, according to the article, they are both """"specialists"""". They only eat certain things so the areas they can survive in is limited.

6965	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They depend entirely one single food, Pandas eat only bamboo and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons, because as the article says, pythons are generalists. They have a much wider variety of food sources and can adapt to many areas whereas the panda and koala live off one food source so they adapt and more to new habitats.
6975	3	2	2	This article allistates that panda bears in China are similar to koala bears in Australia because they are specialist. They both eat a certain plant and live a certain way. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist, and can live almost anywhere, regardless of the climate and can adapt quickly.
6979	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koala in Australia are very similar. They are specialists and only eat one type of food like eucalyptus leaves. These animals do not adapt well to change and can flourish with stability in the environment. Pythons are generalist which can withstand a large amount of change. They can live in multiple places and eat multiple foods. Pandas and koalas are specialists unlike pythons are generalists.
7004	3	2	2	The similarities between a panda and a koala is that they are one of kind species which eat one type of food in order to survive, such as panda eats only bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They different from pythons because pythons are world life and travel all over to kill pray.
7016	3	2	2	"""China's panda and Australia's Koala are similar because the both anywhere one or two things they eat.Pandas eat the Bamboo & the Koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus.

( Achendach). They're able to live on different food sources such as different animals and reptiles so pythons can evolve and adapt to their environment."""
7026	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas primarily eat bamboo, and koalas primarily eat eucalyptus. This makes it nearly impossible for them to live any where but where their main source of food grow. Pythons, however, are generalists. They are able to live in many warm climates and have little difficulty finding food.
7037	3	2	2	Pandas in China only eat bamboo, which is mainly found in China. Similarly, koalas live in Australia and only eat eucalyptus leaves from that habitat. However since a python is a generalist, it can survive i different habitats. Although they have their own diets, they eat a larger variety of foods to help them survive.'' We live in an age that favors generalist rather than specialists.''
7038	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they are specialists. They are specialists because, for example, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. This is different from pythons, who are generalists. They can eat and live in many places like humans, and unlike pandas or koalas.
7041	3	2	2	"""Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are very similar to each other due to their endangerment and dietary prefference to bamboo and eucalyptus. However, according to the article.""""A python swallowed an alligator and there's not a delicate way to it- exploded."""" That shows how unlike the panda a koalas the python will eat anything."""
7044	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist that eat only a certain kind of food. The article said that a panda only eats bamboo and a koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. They  both differ from pythons because a python is a generalist while koala bear and a panda are specialists.
7049	3	2	2	"""As mentioned in paragraph 21 pandas are both specialists, with strict diets. Pandas eat """"almost nothing but bamboo"""" and koalas eat """"eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.""""

7056	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. Pandas mostly eat bamboo which is similar to Koalas as they mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. Both species are also similar because they'd have to stay in their native home to survive. Unlike the generalist python who eats ab mixture of common things and can live in multiple places.
7062	3	2	2	They are both similar because they have an exclusive diets. One eats bamboo while the other eats leaves only. The python has a wider range of animals food. They are different because the panda and koala can only live in very particular areas while the python can live in alot more different areas.
7072	3	2	2	Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are both specialists, and a python is a generalist. A specialist is something that only eats one special kind of food. For example, a koala only eats leaves & pandas only eat bamboo. Generalists have a much greater variety in food, for example, a python loves to eat many different types of rodents, but it also eats animals like alligators.
7089	3	2	2	The pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat almost nothing but one type of plant and therefore could not survive in other parts of the world where the plant does not grow. Pythons however eats a wider variety of food sources and therefore could live in more than one place in the world.

7106	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both only eat one specific thing. The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala eats basically only eucalyptus leaves (paragraph 21). They differ from pythons because pythons can/and do eat a variety of different things. These things can be found anywhere unlike bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. The python can live anywhere basically (paragraph 21) but the panda and koala can't.
7121	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas are both similar because they are both specialists. That means that they both eat certain things in certain conditions. Pandas in China and koalas in Australia basically only eat bamboo, arive koalas only almost eucalyptus leaves. Pythons however are generalists. Pythons can live in many conditions. They can live in Asian and America.
7128	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are what the article calls specialists. These animals only eat certain foods, only live in certain areas, and don't flourish in other places because of that. Pythons flourish whenever there is a similar climate and can eat a large variety of food sources, there fore they are generalists.
7134	3	2	2	Panda's in China eat nothing but bamboo, and koalas in Australia eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They both have a specific meal to eat, that isn't found anywhere. Pythons on the other hand eat anything.  As a matter a fact one tried eating an alligator. Unfortunatley they also eat endangered species such as keylargo woodfeat.
7137	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they each eat almost nothing else than one thing. For pandas it's bamboo and for koalas it's eucalyptus leaves. These animals are both different from pythons because they wouldn't migrate well due to needing much of one type of food and certain climate.
7144	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat one thing almost exclusively. Pythons on the other hand can and will eat anything in the last conoe, paragraph 11 says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. In paragraph 13 it even says that the python tried to eat a alligator.
7148	3	2	2	Panda's in China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they are both considered specialist species. They both have a select food that they most likely can't live without so they must live where that food is found, pythons however can adapt to most places for food.
7150	3	2	2	The specialists such as China's panda and Australia's Koala are similar because they both need specific things to live. For example the panda needs bamboo which is only commonly food in China and the Koala eats only eucalyptus leaves which must be found in high areas there. They are different to the generalists because they can adapt and live wherever they are placed.

7177	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They eat only one, type of food thats exclusive in one each area. Pandas and koalas cannot survive outside their natural habitat, they need stability. They are different from pythons. Pythons are generalists, and they strive with change, They can easily adapt to different environments.
7184	3	2	2	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because as said in the article, they are both specialists, because they both rely on a food that they specialize in eating, like the pandas mainly eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalist because they can adapt to different things, rather than than relying on one thing to survive.
7193	3	2	2	Pandas in China relate to koalas in Australia because they only will eat one thing. Pandas will eat almost nothing other than bamboo and koalas with eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. But on the other hand, the python will eat almost everything. In the everglades in 2005 the python swallowed an alligator. The panda and koala bears eat almost the same thing everyday while the python will eat anything that  comes near it.
7194	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they can only live in limited places, because they both only eat one type of food and would die in the wild in the United States. They are different from pythons because pythons don't need much to survive all they need is a warm climate and small mammals to feed on. Which both of those are found in about 60% o the world.
7196	3	2	2	Pandas in China are only able to survive in China like koala's are only able to survive in Australia. They cannot adapt to other habitats. Pythons, however are able to adapt to different climates and are able to spread throughout the southern part of the United States. Pythons are more of a generalist species than pandas and koalas.
7197	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia in the way that they are both specialists. They both eat very exclusive diets and therefore must live in one of the few locations that support their lifestyles. Pythons, on the other hand, can live very many habitats as they are generalists, which makes them different from koalas and pandas.
7198	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koala's because they are both specialists. This means they both need a very specific enviroment to survive. Pandas and koalas both eat just one type of food that they cannot survive without. For pandas, it's bamboo: for koalas, its eucalyptus leaves. Unlike pandas and koalas, pythons are generalists. They can survive in many different enviroments. This is one reason they have been able to invade and survive in the south which is not where they originated.
7233	3	2	2	"""Pandas and koalas are specialists, they only eat one type of food and therefore cannot spread easily for lack of abundance of food.

Both these creatures differ from a python, because pythons are very adaptable and can live almost anywhere."""
7243	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar to each other because they mainly just eat one thing (panda - bamboo, koala - eucalyptus leaves). They both greatly differ from pythons because pythons eat alot of stuff, endangered animals, like the pythons eat the key largo wood rats. While the koala and panda mainly feed on 1 food source.
7266	3	2	2	The Great pandas of China and the koalas of Australia are both specialist species. This means that they can only live where their main food source can survive whic for pandas are bamboo leaves. A python is a generalist. This means that with a little assistance can live anywhere  and proper. This means that they pose more at the ecological threat as to their ability to adapt to their environment.
7279	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are very similar in many ways. They are both considered ''specialists'' which are animals who depend mostly on one thing and would have a hard time adapting to other climates. An example of this is the fact is that pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves. The python, however can adapt to new environments like the U.S. Pythons also eat what they want making it easier.

7302	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists because they cannot live anywhere. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Contrastingly, pythons are generalists, simmilar to humans. Pythons can eat and live, with the help of technology, wherever they like humans favor generalists rather than specialists.
7325	3	2	2	"""China's panda or Australia koalas are similar because they are both specialist animals.

7343	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar as they are both specialist who consume very few at one source of food. They are different however to the different types of pythons as pythons are generalists. Generalists will adapt to many different places and eat exstive foods to survive. Such as raccoons who eat garbage, meat, and insects.

7386	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, they eat very specific foods other specialist animals need specific climates and such. The article tells us that pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo and koalas, eucalyptus. Pythons eat a much wider range of food and have spread to live in less exclusive places than koalas and pandas bears.
7387	3	2	2	Koalas and pandas are both specialist species. They have one major food source and don't adapt well to change. The python is a generalist species. It will basically eat any thing it can fit in it's mouth allowing it to adapt to new areas quickly.
7389	3	2	2	Pandas & Koalas are similar animals because they both have a very specific life style that they must maintain. The pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo & Koalas eats eucalyptus, without these food sources they would probably ate because unlike the python they can't adapt well at all to other enviornment. Also pandas & koalas are mamals while pythons are reptiles.
7392	3	2	2	"""In the article, both pandas in China and koalas in Australia are considered """"specialists"""".

7396	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only live in specific climates and each certain foods. For example pandas strictly eat bamboo. These two animals are both different from the python, because they are not a generalist creature, which can live in numerous climates and has a variety diet.
7412	3	2	2	Pandas In China and Koalas in Australia are both specialist species meaning that they can only live and survive in a specific area where there is the right climate and food sources. Pythons on the other hand are generalists species meaning that they can live and survive in places all over the world.

7438	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similare because they both eat exclusively. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The why that pandas and koalas differ from pythons is that, pythons vary in appetite. They could eat from  a rat to an alligator, while pandas and koalas are limited.
