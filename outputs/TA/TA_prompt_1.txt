44	1	3	3	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
76	1	3	3	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
206	1	3	3	"""1. What kind of """"sample of material"""" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."""
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
467	1	3	3	"""The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like """"Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"""" should be stated in the procedure."""
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
567	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
627	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
804	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
818	1	3	3	"""Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of """"samples"""" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."""
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
977	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
984	1	3	3	"""The group of students didn't specify what """"samples"""" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."""
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1168	1	3	3	"""The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the """"4 different samples"""" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."""
1178	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1191	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1205	1	3	3	The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
1206	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
1211	1	3	3	One additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using, this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup. Lastly, I would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar.
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1252	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1273	1	3	3	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
1276	1	3	3	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
1285	1	3	3	"""In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for """"samples"""", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."""
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1458	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1551	1	3	3	"""The group neglected to include what the """"four different samples"""" are. They should have said, """"use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"""". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."""
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.

1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?

You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.

What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"""
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1675	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure. It should state specifically marble, limestone, wood and plastic. It should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results. The last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes,glass test tubes,ziploc bags etc.
1681	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedures, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container. This important because  it could affect  how much of the sample is dissolved. I would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark. Also I would need to know the formula for finding the difference incase I didn't know. It is a common error to subtract the wrong masses. Finally, I would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not.This would affect its weight.
1686	1	3	3	To replicate the group's experiment, the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers. Also, they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results. In the procedure, they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment, a key variable to it's success.
1689	1	3	3	Information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample of material, and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar.
1701	1	3	3	"""The procedure is very unclear. In order to replicate this experiment, the procedure must be more specific, for example, instructions must be made about; how much vinegar must you pour into the containers, what kind of containers should be used, specify what the four samples are in the procedure."""
1702	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to add to the procedure. First, you'd need to know what four samples to use, how much of the sample to use, how much vinegar to add to the sample, decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample.
1704	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for example,they should list the four different sample names. Second they should give the size of the container. Last, they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar.
1723	1	3	3	"""In order to replicate this experiment, I believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample. They need to say where the samples are being stored during the 24 hours and at what temperature.

1734	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container, also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit. The placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they shouldn't be, it could change the results. How much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too.
1736	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers. It also doesn't let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material. Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area.
1737	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container, the temperature of vineger, how long and visarable the samples should be rinsed, number of trials, type of container the sample should be placed in, and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass.
1740	1	3	3	What kind of vinegar,how much vinegar,what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples.
1749	1	3	3	The procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data. For exact data. The procedure must also state how much vinegar to use. Also, step three doesn't state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar.
1755	1	3	3	One thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are. They should have also told us what the materials were that they were using, and how much of it to use. Another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything.
1756	1	3	3	1.You would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment. ^p 2.You need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers. ^p 3.You need to know what temperatures to have the samples in, (room warm, cold).
1757	1	3	3	To replicate the experimenty, you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container. You would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored. In addition you would need to know what materials the samples were.
1760	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need is what the samples were, how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers, because whether vinegar may us more acidic.
1770	1	3	3	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are, what are the 4 different samples that I would be testing, what size container would I need and how much vinegar do I use.
1772	1	3	3	Some of the things that you would need inables to repeat this experiment is, tell you what samples they are using. All they say is, get the mass of four different samples, don't state what they are. Also how much vinegar is being added to the containers. They did not say what amount of vinegar they put in. The last thing is that,
1773	1	3	3	"""To replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the """"samples"""" mentioned in step 1 are. This way, there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with. Also, you would need to know what kind of containers the """"samples"""" are kept in. Lastly, in order to properly replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container."""
1778	1	3	3	There are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment. The first is how much vinegar to use in each container. A second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples. Third, you would need to know in what form the samples are. The marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome.
1784	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass, also what type & size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment (temperature, brightness) they were left in for the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result.
1789	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure, information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step 2 , what materials were used in step 3, or how much of the material was used, also in 3 would be crucial.
1791	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment I need to know specifically what samples they are talking about, what type of control to use in this  experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container. I would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours, if they should be in a certain temperature (room temp,high temp, or low temp. etc).

1807	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the following information. First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Second, I would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers. Finally I would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours, because the temperatures of the solution/room could affect the results.
1813	1	3	3	The group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container. They would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water. They would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure, and to say to record the data.

1823	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, as well as the size and shape of each container. You would also want to know the type of vinegar used, all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity.
1827	1	3	3	The additional information needed is: ^p -Name the specific samples used in the procedure ^p -Say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers ^p -Should the samples sit in light, dark areas or covered ?
1831	1	3	3	In order to replicate this acid rain experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant. Also how big each sample is, results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size. Also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently.
1832	1	3	3	The group could have told how much vinegar, the acual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples. For example, how lange  was the piece of wood? Would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass.
1836	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure. Firstly, I would need to know what types of samples to use. I can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table, but I would want to know if I had to use the same ones. Also, I would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, because my results could change if I use a different amount of vinegar than the group did. Depending on the amount of vinegar I use, the third thing I would need to know is how big the samples should be. If it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample, the procedure should tell me that so I don't make the sample too big.
1839	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedure I would need to know what the materials were,the size of the material, and how much vinegar was in each container.
1844	1	3	3	"""There is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment. For example, the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use. It also just says """"samples"""" and doesn't specify what the samples are of. The procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data."""
1855	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the ''samples'' were. Without this information, it would be impossible to do the experiment. One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container- this could effect the outcome of the experiment. In addition, one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment.
1857	1	3	3	1) I would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples. ^p 2) I would need to know how much vineagar to put in each containar. ^p 3) I would need to know the approximate size of the samples.
1859	1	3	3	You would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment. Where would you put them over night. How big would the containers be for the samples.
1860	1	3	3	Additional data that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more  or less than another, the data may also bear altered.I would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with. Lastly to be able to replicate this experiment. One would also need to know the temperature for every it's materials. Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance.
1862	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know the size of each of the samples. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar being used. Last, I would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for.
1870	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment woold be what types of containers, what type of materials, and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container,  because it doesn't state these items in their proceduer.

Repeat w/remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single contem. After 24 hours, remov the samples from the containers & rinse with distilled water for 3 minutes. 5) Allow the samples to sit & dry for 30 minutes at room temperature. 6) Determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass (in grams) from ending mass in grams )."""
1880	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's procedure you would need to know ^p -How much vinegar should be pour each cup? ^p -What type of container should be used? ^p -If the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered.
1882	1	3	3	One other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container, so all samples have the same amount. Another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for 24 hours, because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment. Other than than, this experiment is replicable.
1895	1	3	3	They would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup, what sample material would be, determine the temp that the samples should dry at.
1908	1	3	3	This procedure lacks important details and is not in order. Step one is too similar to step 6. Need to specify what kind of different samples, and how to determine the beginning mass. Step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container. The procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results. Step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information. In step 6, they should include how to calculate the mass, for example subtract beginning mass from end mass. Add, record data results.
1915	1	3	3	How much vinegar, how big should the containers be and how big should the samples be are all additional information you would need to recreate this experiment.
1925	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you need to have information. Some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the seperate containers. Another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off. Another thing where you let the samples sit for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys.
1926	1	3	3	The additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are. The amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step 2 also need to be known. Another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step 3. Another part of this experiment that needs more information is step 2, what type of container should the samples be placed into.
1927	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples. Another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container. The third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water. Another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in.
1928	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, you will need top know how much vinegar is being used, how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in.
1932	1	3	3	In order to better replicate this expiriment, the students must also tell us the amount ofvinegar poured into each cup (m/s), the amount of water used to rinse the materials (in m/s) and the time given to rinsing (how long may each container rinsed in water).
1941	1	3	3	The additional information i would need to replicate the experiment, i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing. The seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level. You say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off.
1942	1	3	3	There is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment. First, the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication. Furthermore, the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers. The size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure. Furthermore, it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure.
1958	1	3	3	One thing you could change is the amount of vinegar, the sample size, and were you dry it because of the temp.
1966	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers. Secondly, what kind of containers did the students use. Thirdly, what expecting is in the sample itself.
1973	1	3	3	In this procedure, there are a esuple pieces of information that should be included. They should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample. Also . it should tell you to record the data of starting mass, they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure. Finally, at the end of the procedure, it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses.
1981	1	3	3	The first piece of information that is nesessary to repeat this experiment, if only given the procedure, is what the four samples are. We would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container. We would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twenty-four hour period.
1982	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know opromatly the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers, I need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass. Another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in, the temperature and lighting could effect my results. Lastly, I would need to know if the containers are covered or left open, if they are left open some of the vinegar could evaporte, thus effecting my results.
1984	1	3	3	What  additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used, what kind of vinegar they used, and how big and what kind of containers they used, they should also have a control group plus, they should tell for how big each sample is.
1986	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container, you  would need to know what the four different samples were, and you would need to know whether or not  to cover or put a lid on the containers.
1990	1	3	3	Firstly, the students need to be clearer with their procedure.The amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results, so an exact amount is desireable.how big are the containers, the size matters when replicating.Another necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples, they all must be the same
1995	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to use, what form each sample is in, and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment.
1998	1	3	3	To be able to replicate the folowing experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to place  in each container.I would also need to know what samples to use. Where do I put the containers for 24 hours.
2001	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container, I would need to know how big the containers were.
2004	1	3	3	After reading the students procedure, one thing I  would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample. Another thing I would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in, and if they should be covered. The last thing I'd have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing. If all those things were done, the experiment would go a lot smoother, and the results would be a lot more accurate.
2012	1	3	3	To complete this experiment again, the cares of the samples should have been stated at the beginning with at knowing knowing what the samples are, how are you suppost to experiment on them. There should be a list of all the things that you will need during this experiment. And there should be more details like, what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass, or what kind of container is it, or were do you store the experiment for those 24 hours.
2013	1	3	3	a) Size of the containers, types of containers. ^p b) Amount of vinegar. ^p c) Size of the samples.
2016	1	3	3	The three imost they had bett.where how much vinegar did they use for the experiment. Also, that they forgot to saw how big containers were and if they cover the container after they put the vinegar and materials.
2017	1	3	3	In addition, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the four containers, also the size of the containers and how much of the sample was put into each container.
2034	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the group would need to state the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into the containers. The group also needs to state if the containers should be covered and at what temperature the containers should be stored.
2038	1	3	3	"""To replicate the experiment more information is needed such as, the amount of vinegar in each cup, what the samples are, how long the samples should be rinsed and clearer directions instead of saying, """" pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers,"""" explain how much vinegar and whether cups should be large or small. The experiment procedure needs to be more specific so that more trials can be done exactly the same or as close as possible, for a more accurate conclusion."""
2042	1	3	3	In this groups,  procedure you wuld need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in container and also what kind of container. Also they could add what temprature they left the material in the containers.
2043	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, in order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar was needed, how big was the sample pieces and did need to be close to sunlight or just room light.
2045	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information needed would be the volume of vinegar. Also, the procedure should say if the containers are covered or uncovered. Finally, it should specify what the samples should dry in, like a petri dish, to avoid contamination.
2048	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be to know what the four different samples are that are being tested. Another piece of additional information needed is the amount of vinegar being poured in step 2. One other piece of additional info would be how long to rinse the samples in distilled water,and what temperature the water should be at while rinsing.
2052	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four seperate but identical containers. I would also need to know what the four samples were even though it is stated in the data table, it is not stated in the procedure where it should be stated. Another thing would be helpful to know is what types of container I should I put the samples in so that I can replicate the experiment the same way they performed it.
2058	1	3	3	First are they didn't fell you to put on your safety gageles. Then they determine the mass of four different samples are of what to use to get the mass with the next step it doesn't say what kind of containers to use. Glass or metal or raind or savare, i also don't know what to label. Do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also because it doesn't say how to.
2083	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used, what temperature the room in which the samples were and how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample . Another factor you should know to replicate the experiment was if the corner used was dark or if sunlight touched the rocks during the experiment.
2087	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would have to no the amount and mass of the vinegar. You would also have to no the temperature of the vinegar and the temperature when the stones were drying. Another piece of information needed is the ph of the vinegar. You would also have to no what type of wood used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also have to no the type of plastic.
2088	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would require a few more pieces of information. For example, how much vinegar to put in. That piece of information is never mentioned in the procedure, and it is very important to ensure validity. Another piece of information needed is a supply list. It is never stated with what you are supposed to determine the mass and the only supplies mentioned are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar. Also, where the containers should be kept is never mentioned, because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to be invalid.
2091	1	3	3	Some additional info that I would need for this experiment is the temp that they would have the containers in. Also another piece of info I would need is how much vinegar I should put in. And last info that I would need is should the room I leave them in be light, dark or should it be moderate. All this to make the experiment reenactment accurate.
2099	1	3	3	You would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar is used, and how to dry them.
2107	1	3	3	Reading the group's procedure it should have been more thorough for me to replicate that experiment. They needed to included in their procedure, the 4 types of samples that were experimenting on.The amount of vinegar used in their experiment, the types of containers that were used and the size of each container. They also needed to include the name of the sample that should be poured into container and also which container. Also where were the containers left to dry the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside, for me to be able to replicate this experiment.
2117	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab that the students made, the procedure for you would have to know, what kind of materials you are using for the practical to place in the vinegar. Also, you would need to measure what after placing below, you should go through before including the labs. You also need to know how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to use.
2118	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, they should also put so the procedure, how much vinegar so the amount of liquid is equal, where they should sit & dry (a window, canter, if its on anything, under a light etc.) How do you rinse it with distilled water( also you use soap, let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry).
2127	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples. I would also need to know in what kind of container because the material can effect the outcome and whether to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat.
2136	1	3	3	First you would have to say what the samples have to be , you also have to say how much vinegar to pour in the containers, and how big the containers should be.
2137	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of heat/sunlight. How long should you rinse it for.
2141	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment, is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results. Secondly, I would need to know in what condition I should plac the container in. It is possible heat and light may alter the results. Finally, I would need to know if the containers should be covered or not. The samples being exposed to oxygen can also alter the results.
2145	1	3	3	In step one, I would need to know what the four samples were that I was determining mass of. In step two, I would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to know what temperature to place the samples at in step 4.
2155	1	3	3	First, the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample. In the procedure, there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind. Also, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container. This is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume. The procedure, finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant. Surface area may be a factor in the experiment.
2156	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat. Another one is to list out the materials, it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment. Next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar,water etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put  thing for example where do you put the materiasl often washing them off.
2158	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you need. Also, I would need to know the size of the samples. Should they all be the same size or different? It doesn't tell you what size the samples should be. The last piece of information I would need is what the samples even are. The procedure doesn't tell you which materials to even use.
2159	1	3	3	I would need to know what kind of container the sample were put in,and the amount of vinegar poured on the samples, also the kind of vinegar.
2162	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they poured into the container for each sample. I would also need to know what kind of marble, wood and plastic they used since there isn't one kind of each. It would be useful to know what containers were used and hou long they rinsed the samples for.
2174	1	3	3	The students needed to explain what samples they were using in the procedure, they needed to say how much vinegar to use and what type of vinigar to use.
2176	1	3	3	What kind of containers are needed? What are the four different samples ? How much vinegar do you put in to each container?
2184	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar is being put into each cup. The specific types of plastic, wood, limestone and marble and how long the samples were rinsed for.
2193	1	3	3	One thing someone would need is which materials they are testing, if the procedure doesn't include marble, limestone etc, then it can't be replicated. The procedure should also include  how much vinegar to put into each container because of this faster mass not controlled the experiment won't be valid. Finally, the students need to add where to keep the containers because different environments can affect the results they get for each.
2197	1	3	3	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the samples and container sizes. Also you need lables to identify each sonified container. The same amount andend of vinegar and water. Finally, the same amount of time. And creat a lable the somewhere
2198	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need to complete the experiment would be to know what the samples are in the procedure, also I would need to know how big the containers need to be and how much vinegar to pour in. Also I would need to know what temperature the samples need to be at, also if they are covered or uncovered. Then I would need to run a control of water on the samples and run the experiment multiple times.
2209	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container. I would also need to know how long I had to rinse each item. I also need to know what the samples were dried on.
2210	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the procedure would have to say which samples to use. It actually only says place a sample of one material into a container, I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four seperate, but identical containers. For this step I would need to know what size of containers I should use for the experiment. I would also have to measure each sample before and after doing, the lab so I would add that to my procedure.
2220	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, would be the amount of vinergar to place with the samples. Also, I need to know if there were certain temperature the samples needed to be placed in. The last thing I need to know is what type of containers to put the samples in. You don't know if the vinegar is going to affect the containers.
2222	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinigar was added to the containers. Another piece of information needed is, what kind of containers were used in the investigation. Finally, the last poice of information needed to replicate the investigation is, how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water, also how much water was used to rinse.
