25949	10	2	2	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays off of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture , and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse painted black the dog would get to hot and die . so white
25953	10	2	2	white :: I would use alight color like White in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot .Like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest .
25958	10	2	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees . There for if the dog house was painted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside .
25959	10	2	2	black :: The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside . The average temperature with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) . The average temperature for the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) and for the white it was 42 ( DEG ) . There is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the black and white colored lid . So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside .
25968	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint because in the experiment , the jar with the white lid increased the least in temperature . It increased 18 ( DEG ) C while the black lid made the temperature increase 29 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat .
25971	10	2	2	white :: The best color to paint the dog house would be white . White reflects more light than black . This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black . In the experiment , the white lid was at an average of 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid . Therefore , the white would be the best color to paint the dog house .
25973	10	2	2	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it will be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black . Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53 ( DEG ) and when it was white the inside of the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C
25976	10	2	2	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25977	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of the light energy , but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get too hot or cold . The white color had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes , which might be too cold . The dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , which might be too hot .
25989	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53 ( DEG ) C , which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors . So to me I think black would be the best color .
25991	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm . On average , the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 42 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 21 ( DEG ) C ) . Compared to the black color ed lid , which went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 53 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 29 ( DEG ) C , which is too hot ) . Or the white colored lid which went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 4 2 ( DEG ) C ( a difference of 18 ( DEG ) C ) . Therefore , a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse .
25992	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool since according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar coolest .
25993	10	2	2	black :: the black one will have a good heat for the dog because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 ( DEG ) c .
25995	10	2	2	light gray :: I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in the summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot .
25998	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because it would keep the dog cooler . White would absorb less solar and thermal energy , therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse . In the experiment , the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42 ( DEG ) C , while the black lid jar averaged 53 ( DEG ) C . The light gray lid produced and air temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48 ( DEG ) C .
25999	10	2	2	"""black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside because darker colors absorb more energy . And in """"Air Temperature"""" the average temp . for black was 53 ( DEG ) , while the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) . Every starting temperature started at 24 ( DEG ) , therfore , black would be the best color to choose for the dog house ."""
26000	10	2	2	"""black :: black will be the based color for the dog hou es because .In the chart """"lid color vs .Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3 .Dark gray , Light gyay , and White where in the low to high 40's .black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed ."""
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint color for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlight and so it would be cooler . If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45 ( DEG ) c so white would be a great doghouse color .
26004	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black , then the temperature will be warmer , because it has the highest average temperature at 53 ( DEG ) C .If they use white , then it will bne colder , because the average when white was 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer it will be because black was 11 ( DEG ) C more than white .
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler . White does attract heat like the color black does . When started at 24 ( DEG ) C , the black lidded jar went up to an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . And the white lid ded jar , which also started at 24 ( DEG ) C , only went up to an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
26017	10	2	2	white :: the best color to choose would be white because on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26019	10	2	2	white :: according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature , the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb light .
26021	10	2	2	white :: It might affect the temperature inside the doghouse . The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature , therefore making it the best color to build the doghouse with .
26023	10	2	2	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temperature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day , than say black paint for example . When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the white lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature . On average about 6 .6 ( DEG ) C cooler , compared with the averages for the other lids . So , therefore white paint is the better choice , especially if you are looking to keep the inside of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day .
26024	10	2	2	white :: In the expirement is stated that lighter col ors are cooler than darker colors .White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot .
26025	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much . Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it would keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool .
26026	10	2	2	white :: if the dog house was white then when it is hot the dog house would be cooler .in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius .
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler . In the trials , the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature was .
26033	10	2	2	black :: The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest .
26038	10	2	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be black because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would . the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) , and all others were between 42 and 48 ( DEG )
26041	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the dog house white . The highest temperature was 53 ( DEG ) for the black lid . Which would cause the dog to overheat . While the lowest temperature was 42 ( DEG ) for the white lid . Which would help the dog stay cool . So i would paint my dog house white because it is 11 ( DEG ) cooler than painting it black .
26048	10	2	2	white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better . as it said in the results , it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the doghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black . The color black which absorbs a lot of energy , results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures . Based on the experiment , the results show that that light gray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45 ( DEG ) C , 8 ( DEG ) C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures . Therefore , a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray .
26050	10	2	2	black :: the darker the doghouse color , the greater the increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs more energy . In the experiment , the color black absorbed the most energy , causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest . The results for black we re 54 ( DEG ) C , 52 ( DEG ) C , 54 ( DEG ) C , and 53 ( DEG ) C . While all the other colors that were lighter , absorbed less energy .
26051	10	2	2	white :: i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors ( dark gray , black , light gray ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) the sun reflects off of it so white would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white , what would u pick?
26053	10	2	2	white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
26054	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse will be warmer . The doghouse will be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26057	10	2	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat , so the dog wont be as hot . If Brandi and Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ( ( DEG ) C ) was 54 , in trial two its ( ( DEG ) C ) were 52 , in trial 3 its ( ( DEG ) C ) were 54 and the average is 53 . So these results show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not make the dog comfortable with all the heat . While the white lid in the experiment had very low temperatures its ( ( DEG ) C ) were 42 , 43 , 41 and its average came to 42 ( ( DEG ) C ) so this shows that the white will absorb barley any heat .
26058	10	2	2	"""black :: Black would be the best color to paint the doghouse , because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the doghouse warm . According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment """" lid vs . air temperature"""" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer than any of the other colored lids . So , therefore the black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors ."""
26062	10	2	2	white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house . I say this because the average temp of the color white is 42 ( DEG ) C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp .
26064	10	2	2	white :: The color White might affect the inside of the doghouse by keeping it the coolest . The average for the color black was 53 ( DEG ) C , the average for Dark Grey was 48 ( DEG ) C , the average for Light Grey was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average for White was 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to keep the doghouse cool .
26067	10	2	2	black :: the color black heats the doghouse the most . it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees , light grey=45 degrees , and white=42 degrees . so black would be the best color
26072	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for . After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray , dark gray , or black lidded jars . With a starting temprature of 24 ( DEG ) C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53 ( DEG ) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid . Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me .
26073	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outside . When the black lid was used in the expiriment , it was on average 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid , 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid , and 11 degrees warmer than the white . Therefore , if the doghouse is painted black , the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghouse was painted dark gray , light gray , or white .
26074	10	2	2	"""black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the """"Hot Lamp"""" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors ."""
26076	10	2	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse LIGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so that is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and its not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45 ( DEG ) and for black it was 53 ( DEG ) and dark grey 48 ( DEG ) and for white was 42 ( DEG ) light grey is the average of them all , 53 ( black ) - 48 ( dark grey ) = 5 53 ( black ) - 45 ( light grey ) = 8 and 53 ( black ) -42 ( white ) = 11 light grey ( 8 ) is in the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should paint the dog house .
26081	10	2	2	light gray :: dark colors makes things really hot for example the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* Cat most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold .
26087	10	2	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint the dog house light gray . painting the dog house light gray would be the best paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had found out that , painting the house black absorbs more heat energy , and painting it white will not absorb enoff energy , so in the middle will be the best for the dog . so not too much thermal energy , but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best .
26089	10	2	2	white :: the color white won't attract as much light as the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny days . the white compared to the black is abetter choice because black color attracts more light , for example it averaged a 53 ( DEG ) C while the white averaged a 42 ( DEG ) C . That is all ( DEG ) C difference .
26095	10	2	2	"""black :: I believe that the best color for the dog house would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to the data table in """"Hot Lamp"""" so the darker the color the warmer the house or object ."""
26096	10	2	2	white :: According to the reults , the lighter the color , the colder the temperature is . Since white had less heat , they would want to paint the dog house white .
26098	10	2	2	white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53 ( DEG ) C , dark grey is 48 ( DEG ) C , light grey is 45 ( DEG ) C , and white is 42 ( DEG ) C .
26101	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white , the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment . The data shows that when the lid was black , the air temperature was warmest , and when the lid was white , the air temperature was coolest . Therefore , painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature for the dog .
26105	10	2	2	white :: White . It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18 ( DEG ) C . In the experiment , the starting temperature of was 24 ( DEG ) C and after ten minutes under a lamp , the air inside the jar increased by 18 ( DEG ) C . Total of 42 ( DEG ) C . If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour , it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise would be too high .
26110	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the doghouse . In the experiment , the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42 ( DEG ) C . The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 ( DEG ) C . The dark gray lid jar averaged 48 ( DEG ) C , and the light gray lid jar averaged 45 ( DEG ) C . The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four .
26112	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray . In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C and was the second highest temperature . The highest temperature was the black lid with 53 ( DEG ) C . The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5 ( DEG ) C . If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm , but yet be a bit cool for them too .
26113	10	2	2	white :: White , because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature ( about 42 ( DEG ) C ) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest .
26122	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer . the dark gray was an average of 48 ( DEG ) C which is not as hot as the black lid which was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45 ( DEG ) C .
26132	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best choice , because you don't want the dog house to cold , but you dont want it to warm . And the average temperature for the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C which is just right for a dog , because you don't want your dog to get to hot . And the black wouldn't be a good color , because darker colors absorb more energy . And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid , making the light grey lid , the cooler , better choice .
26133	10	2	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat . The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat , so it will keep the doghouse cooler .
26134	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white . This is because white doesn't attract as much heat . I know this because in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius . Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot .
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the effect will be warm and cool at the same time . When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too hot and it will not get too cold .
26139	10	2	2	white :: I think white would be the best color to paint the dog house . I say this because white absorbs less energy making the dog house cooler . In the experiment , the white on average was 42 ( DEG ) C , and that was the coolest temperature . The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53 ( DEG ) C . For a dog inside a doghouse , i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog , that's why I chose the color that made the doghouse the coolest .
26142	10	2	2	white :: the dog house will not be to hot . the temperature will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot . white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time .
26143	10	2	2	black :: In my oppinion , Brandi and Jerry would want to paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors . I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm , but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be .
26150	10	2	2	white :: Choosing the lightest shade ( white ) is the best colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round , the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer . Painting the hosue white will ensure that it stays as cool as it can over summer , thus making it the most comfortable for the dog . The white house will remain coolest because as according to the data collected , the average temperature will be aprox . 42 ( DEG ) C , while for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures ( 45 ( DEG ) LGray , 48 ( DEG ) DGray , 53 ( DEG ) Black ) . The white colour was 11 ( DEG ) cooler than the darkest colour ( black ) , thus making it the best colour to paint a dog house .
26152	10	2	2	light gray :: Alight gray color could give you less heat in the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth . Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most heat you woulnt want a dog to get to hot , but also not to cold .
26157	10	2	2	white :: this is the best paint color for the dog house because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp . in the jar the least
26161	10	2	2	light gray :: The color chosen will affect the inside of the doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts . From the experiment , black attracted the most heat ( or air temperature ) with an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , and dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , light gray had 45 ( DEG ) C , and the color white with 42 ( DEG ) C on average . Based on these results , i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat , fewer than darker colors , but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment , the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat . Therefore , light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse .
26163	10	2	2	black :: i think they should use a black for the doghouse because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint would help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53 ( DEG ) c
26171	10	2	2	black :: I think black would be the best color for the doghouse . It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars , the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature . This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out . When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot , it can sleep outside .
26173	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse was white , the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because , like in the experiment , the color white only got an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Unlike the color black , which got an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
26177	10	2	2	white :: I have chose the color white because it had the least highest temperature . In the data from the previous experiment the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) making it the least hottest .
26178	10	2	2	white :: White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42 ( DEG ) C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53 ( DEG ) C .
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color , because it would keep the house warmer . In the experiment , black produced the highest temperature inside the jar ( 53 ( DEG ) C )
26180	10	2	2	light gray :: It would absorb a little amount of heat for the summer time when it's hot . But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter . I know this because the black lid absorbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat .
26182	10	2	2	black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26187	10	2	2	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in order to keep the dgohouse warm . brandi and Jerry's data showed that the darker the lid ( or in this case , doghouse ) the darker the color , the more increase in air temperature . Which in the lid experiment , the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53 ( DEG ) C while others like dark gray and light gray had averages of 48 ( DEG ) and 45 ( DEG ) C .
26188	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat , because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place .
26190	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't have to be super hot in the sun . the average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) after ten minutes and it was 53 ( DEG ) for black showing that black makes it hotter inside .
26191	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than it would with black paint , but warmer than it would with white . In warmer tempatures , the paint will not asborb as much sunlight , so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot . The black paint had an average tempature of 53 ( DEG ) C , while the light gray had an average tempature of 45 ( DEG ) C . That is a difference of 8 ( DEG ) C . The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler , but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint . The white paint had an average tempature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The light gray paint would keep the doghouse 3 ( DEG ) C warmer then the white paint , but 8 ( DEG ) C cooler than the black paint .
26193	10	2	2	black :: black because it well make the dog house warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer .
26195	10	2	2	white :: The best answer would be white because white is alight color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer . When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid on it , the temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . Whereas , when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 ( DEG ) C . That is an 11 ( DEG ) differance . There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white .
26199	10	2	2	black :: Well , darker colors absob more heat than lighter energy , so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse . When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid ( dark color ) for the experiment the results were in the low 50's range , 52-54 ( DEG ) C . but when they used the white lid ( light color ) the results were in the low 40's range , 41-43 ( DEG ) C .
26205	10	2	2	"""black :: If Brandi and Jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black , because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat . My theory is correct because in Bradi and Jerry's hypothesis """"the darker the lid color , the greater the increase is air temperature in the glass jar , because darker color absorbs more energy"""" ."""
26209	10	2	2	white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist , so if they use white it will not get to hot in the dog house .
26210	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gray because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 ( DEG ) c and 48 ( DEG ) c in the experiment , so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around , they probably already are hot enough . Also if it does get cold , light gray will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temperature was 48 ( DEG ) c which is only 2 ( DEG ) c less than dark gray , so i think light gray will be the best color for the dog house .
26212	10	2	2	light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse , be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler , but not too cold and at the same time not too hot . When the lid color of the glass jar was black , the average air temperatuire was 53 ( DEG ) C , after only 10 minutes , when the starting temperature was 24 ( DEG ) C , which I believe might be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse . When their was a white lid , the average temperature after the same amount of time , and starting at the same temperature of 24 ( DEG ) C , was 42 ( DEG ) C , which I believe would be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse . I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot , nor too cold , because after 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24 ( DEG ) C , it's average air temperature inside was 45 ( DEG ) C .
26218	10	2	2	white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in . Also , it was cooler inside because white's average was the lowest ( 42 ( DEG ) ) .
26224	10	2	2	black :: when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53 ( DEG ) , when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42 ( DEG ) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer .
26226	10	2	2	black :: By painting the doghouse black , the air inside the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color . In the experiment , the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53 ( DEG ) , which is 2 ( DEG ) higher than the dark grey lid , 8 ( DEG ) higher than the light grey lid , and 11 ( DEG ) higher than the white lids air temperature . This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it .
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white because white is alight color and does not coduct that much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest average at 42 ( DEG ) c
26230	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the doghouse and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) . That is better than the 53 ( DEG ) average for the black and the 45 ( DEG ) average for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will retain it's heat .
26234	10	2	2	black :: With the color black as the dog house the inside temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment was 53 ( DEG ) C , for dark gray ave . temp . was 48 ( DEG ) C , for light gray it was 45 ( DEG ) Cave . temp . , and for the white lid the ave . temp . was 42 ( DEG ) C . controlled varible: temp . in jar before starting exp . responding:air temp . inside jar after 10 min . uder lamp manipulated: lid color
26238	10	2	2	white :: the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason I know that is in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cooler than the rest of the colors
26240	10	2	2	white :: This color will keep the dog house rather cool that way the dog will not over heat itself . In the experiment , lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature .
26241	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold . This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy . The light gray was about in the middle with 45 ( DEG ) c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog .
26242	10	2	2	white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest , meaning that white paint will keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of the other colors . the white lid kept the jar an average of three degrees celcius cooler than any other color .
26244	10	2	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the doghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out , the black color of the doghouse will keep it warmer . Since darker colors absorb more energy than lighter colors . Black was 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes , while white was 42 ( DEG ) C that is a change of 11 ( DEG ) C warmer then the other .
26246	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm , but not too hot . This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the second warmest color .
26248	10	2	2	dark gray :: I believe that dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house . Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer , it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat . Also , the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it . Considering that dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) inside , it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42 ( DEG ) and the black with an average of 53 ( DEG ) .
26250	10	2	2	white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with the white lid , the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other jars .
26252	10	2	2	white :: They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast . After 10 minutes , white's tempature was 42 ( DEG ) while black's was 53 ( DEG ) . That is an 11 ( DEG ) difference . So the doghouse will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white .
26253	10	2	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse because the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C which means that the increase of air was cooler . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air flow and be cooler then any other color .
26254	10	2	2	white :: The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors , so if they want to keep their dog at a cool temperature , then they should go with the white color . The average temperature for the black colored jar is 53 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42 ( DEG ) C . The black lided jar is 11 ( DEG ) C higher than the white lided jar .
26258	10	2	2	white :: The white attracted the least heat than any of the other colors . The white Low data for white was 41 ( DEG ) and the high data was 43 ( DEG ) .
26259	10	2	2	white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and cool in the experiment white attracted the least heat . example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black .
26260	10	2	2	white :: painting a dog house white will keep it cooler than other colors . in the experiment white had an average temp of 42 ( DEG ) C while black had a 53 ( DEG ) C average
26261	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color to paint the dog house . In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat , staying at a temperature of around 42 ( DEG ) . This would mean that the dog house would stay a cool temperature for the dog .
26262	10	2	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint choice for the doghouse . In the data Brandi and Jerry collected , white had the lowest temperature average of 42 ( DEG ) C . The next coolest was light grey with an average of 45 ( DEG ) C , dark grey with an average of 48 ( DEG ) C and the hottest was black with an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . Therefore white paint will make the doghouse the coolest .
26264	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the dog house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot . This is because from the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got as hot as 54
26266	10	2	2	white :: It would keep the doghouse cooler , especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ( ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42 ( DEG ) , the coolest temperature of them all ) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating .
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white , then it will be cooler . Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42 ( DEG ) c , and the black lid made the inside of the jar 53 ( DEG ) c then we know that white will make the doghouse cooler .
26269	10	2	2	white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot . This is because in the experiment the black absorbed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the data will make the doghouse cooler
26272	10	2	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight , therefore it would become hot on the inside . Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors .
26275	10	2	2	white :: hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black , dark grey , and light grey . the white was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( DEG ) C
26279	10	2	2	white :: The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees . The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside .
26281	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest because the other colors got tempatures of 53 ( DEG ) C , 48 ( DEG ) C , and 45 ( DEG ) C , but the white jar got 42 ( DEG ) C .
26283	10	2	2	dark gray :: The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot , it would be right in the middle . Black , which is 53 C ( average ) would be a little too hot and white , which is 42C would be too cold , so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house .
26288	10	2	2	white :: By choosing the color white , Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions . In the experiment , the average temperature for black lid was 53 ( DEG ) c , for dark gray 48 ( DEG ) c , for light gray 45 ( DEG ) c , and finally for white 42 ( DEG ) c . Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options .
26289	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose the color light gray .Light gray would make the dog house around 45 ( DEG ) C average on the inside . The results show that light gray was an average of 45 ( DEG ) C and black was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . White was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Light gray is 3 degrees warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black . Light gray is a color in between the temperatures , leaving the dog house not to hot or not to cold .
26291	10	2	2	black :: The other colors had between 40 ( DEG ) and 50 ( DEG ) but black is hotter then the other colors .
26293	10	2	2	white :: White , because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black . In your data it shows that in the trials white will be the least hot color .
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day . the average temperature of the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) C cooler then the jar with the black lid
26298	10	2	2	black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse will make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most . Due to the data , a black lid color had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . That will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse much more warmer in temperature . A white lid only had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C , making it too cold for the dog . That's why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the dog warm .
26299	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black , light gray , or dark gray because its the lightest color . This is good because in the summer , if the dog house attracted a lot of heat , the dog could over heat and get sick . The black lid got the hottest air temperature , having an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , dark gray was the second hottest , having an average air temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , light gray had the second coolest air temperature , on average being 45 ( DEG ) C , and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat , and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best .
26303	10	2	2	white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be cooler in the hot summer sun . In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) but it was 53 ( DEG ) for the black lid . You probably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white .
26305	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is alight color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the darker the color the more enrgy it will absorb . In teh data table from their experiment , black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26307	10	2	2	white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) c compared to the other temperatures . White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible .
26310	10	2	2	white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white . i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy . that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat .
26312	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors . Dark colors do not reflect light well , instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures . In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer .
26316	10	2	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog warm becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster .
26318	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler . I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid .
26319	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar held the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature inside the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature . The black lid had the highest average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C , dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , light gray had an average of 45 ( DEG ) C and white had the lowest temperature with 42 ( DEG ) C
26320	10	2	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer . the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42 ( DEG ) , while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53 ( DEG ) . the white was 11 ( DEG ) cooler , so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer .
26321	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray , I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool enough in the summer , because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids .
26323	10	2	2	white :: in the experament the color white absorbed less heat . so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot .
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain . White is a good choice because it let the least amount of heat into the jar . The tempature of the white jar was an average of 11 ( DEG ) C less than the tempature of black jar .
26327	10	2	2	white :: This color will cool down the dog house . The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement .
26329	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house . The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar . The darker the color of the lid got , the warmer the inside of the jar was .
26332	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color doesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air temperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors . So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24 ( DEG ) C the average temperature would only rise up to 42 ( DEG ) C . But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would be in the 45 ( DEG ) C - 53 ( DEG ) C . So white doghouse would be a great pick for the color of the doghouse .
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot . The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable . In the lab , the black got way more heat then the others colors that were used .
26336	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make the dog house warmer than all of the other colors . This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53 ( DEG ) C and the white only got up to 42 ( DEG ) C . Black was the warmest
26340	10	2	2	light gray :: the dog house color should be light gray because in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest color was white .i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to cold in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid was the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42 ( DEG ) !so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it light gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45 ( DEG )
26341	10	2	2	white :: it should be white because in the experiment , the white lid had the lowest air tempeture . you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer .
26342	10	2	2	white :: the color white would be good for the doghouse becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot . in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house .
26343	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white was the coolest in all 4 trials . The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keeping it cool . On hot days the dog would stay cool .
26348	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the doghouse could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot . Black was an average of 53 , and Light gray was 45 . So its a just right roof .
26351	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the dog house because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41 ( DEG ) C , light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44 ( DEG ) C , dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , and black had the hottest temperature of 54 ( DEG ) C .
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26358	10	2	2	dark gray :: -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer , if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer . - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer . -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48 ( DEG ) , the black kept it at 53 ( DEG ) , the light gray kept it at 45 ( DEG ) , and the white kept it at 42 ( DEG ) . thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot . if they used the white the dog house would be too cold . the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog .
26360	10	2	2	light gray :: That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44 ( DEG ) -46 ( DEG ) c . That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out .
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse because since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would .The dark color would not only absorb the light but would also create heat energy .From the results in the experiment white was the color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others .Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog stays cool .
26366	10	2	2	white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data , Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the black to white lid , the black lid was 11 ( DEG ) C more hot than the white lid .
26367	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors . This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot . In the scenario , the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C and the temperatures of the Black , Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53 ( DEG ) C , 48 ( DEG ) C and 45 ( DEG ) C . This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperature than the other three lids .
26368	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would be cooler then the rest of the colors . In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black .
26370	10	2	2	light gray :: The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse . During the experiment , light grey had an average of 48 ( DEG ) c , compared to black whos average was 53 ( DEG ) c and white whos was 42 ( DEG ) c . Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse .
26372	10	2	2	white :: The dog house will remain cooler in the summer . The white lid only had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C in the jar , while the black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C in the jar .
26375	10	2	2	white :: If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse , then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside , rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer .
26380	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of that doghouse cooler in the summer , but it wouldnt make it as warm in the winter , since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid .
26382	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got in the 40's .
26383	10	2	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most . Black , based on the experiment , was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example , in trial 1 , black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius . Light gray had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius . Evidently , black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors .
26387	10	2	2	white :: If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C for a white lid and 53 ( DEG ) C for a black lid .
26393	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun . White would be best because it will absorb the least energy , keeping the temp down , in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53 , while the white color was 42 , and 11 ( DEG ) difference .
26394	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold . at black the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) c and at white the temperature was 42 ( DEG ) c . but at light gray it was 45 ( DEG ) c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold .
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house . White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler during the day . When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C . When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42 ( DEG ) C . This is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C . White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day .
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it , because black got the highest average of 53 C ( DEG )
26401	10	2	2	white :: white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was , the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh .
26402	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it is cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold . But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool .
26403	10	2	2	white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42 ( DEG ) C . while black , on average , made the jar the hottest at 53 ( DEG ) C . so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black , dark gray , or light gray .
26404	10	2	2	white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 ( DEG ) C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53 ( DEG ) C
26406	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray . Because the color is not that dark , but not that light ether . For the summer it wont be that hot , and in the winter it wont be that cold ether . Also the tempetures of the data came out that the gray color is right in the middle ( average ) of the experiment .
26409	10	2	2	black :: It would make it warmer for the dog so it would be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold . In the experiment the results show that the darker the color , the warmer it is inside .
26413	10	2	2	white :: the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as does darker colors , for example , in the air temprature expeirament . they put a dark colord lid over ajar , with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius . after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c . but when they put the lighter coverd lid over the jar ( at a starting point of 24c ) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c . so the best choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog .
26414	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be best to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives , but not overly heated in the summer . In the experiment , the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48 ( DEG ) . A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog . In the investigation , the air temperature of black was at 53 ( DEG ) . The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog . The air temperatures of the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) and of the white was 42 ( DEG ) . This is why I would choose the dark gray paint for a doghouse .
26416	10	2	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest , the black was the hottest , then came the dark gray , than light grey , then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog .
26422	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to use for the doghouse . This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and therefore it wont be as hot insdie the house . With the white colored jar lid , the average tempurature is 42 ( DEG ) C . The averages for the Light Gray , Dark Gray and black lids were 45 ( DEG ) C , 48 ( DEG ) C and 53 ( DEG ) C . This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and more comfortable for the dog .
26430	10	2	2	white :: In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat , and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house . And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool during the summer .
26442	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside , the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outside . In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45 ( DEG ) C while white had 42 ( DEG ) C and the black had an avergae of 53 ( DEG ) C . This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight . The black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm .
26452	10	2	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors . Dark gray's average temperature was 48 degrees celcius , light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius , and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius .
26460	10	2	2	black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data .
26464	10	2	2	white :: If you paint the dog house white , it will stay nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when the lid was white , the average temperature , 42 ( DEG ) C , was colder than the others . When the lid was black the average temperature was highest , 53 ( DEG ) C , which is 11 ( DEG ) more than the white lid's average .
26471	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( DEG ) C average . And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best . The other colors averages were black= 53 ( DEG ) C dark gray=48 ( DEG ) C and Light gray= 45 ( DEG ) C which are to hot for a dog to be living in .
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog house because , in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature . black had a ending tempature average of 53 ( DEG ) C and the white lid had a ending tempature average of 42 ( DEG ) C . therefor , white would be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog .
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compared to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26481	10	2	2	black :: if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day . I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house .
26482	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42 ( DEG ) C while black was about 53 ( DEG ) C .
26485	10	2	2	white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse . In the experiment white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C while the other colors had higher temperature averages .
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat . That would keep the doghouse warm . The results showed that the jar with the black lid was th warmest after 10 minues .
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color . But with black it attracts the sun . so inside this doghouse when black , it can get hot . but with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53 ( DEG ) c as the black had . the white had a average of 42 ( DEG ) c which is not hot compared to 53 ( DEG ) c .
26494	10	2	2	black :: this color will help keep the insideof the doghouse warmer . the black colored lid is 9 ( DEG ) warmer than the white col ored lid .
26495	10	2	2	light gray :: After being exposed to heat , white was the coolest with 42 ( DEG ) C , followed by light gray with 45 ( DEG ) C , dark gray , and then black . By using light grey , the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer , unlike black , and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter , unlike white .
26496	10	2	2	black :: Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outside , so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature . on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees . 12 degree difference!
26498	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C whereas the light grey had an average of 45 ( DEG ) C , the dark grey had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C and the black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C .
26500	10	2	2	white :: The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees . That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white .
26505	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors . This is because , the average air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C , the light grey lid was 45 ( DEG ) C , the dark grey lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , and the balck lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . The difference between the darkest ( black ) lid and the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) C .
26506	10	2	2	white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26512	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray . This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat ( black ) had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the coolest ( white ) had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C , the light grey lid had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C , a medium between the two , which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer .
26516	10	2	2	black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghouse warmer . Dark colors absorb more heat energy . In the experiment with the jar , the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
26519	10	2	2	black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter . In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter . It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate .
26520	10	2	2	light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures , but will also absorb enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment . While the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temperature of 53 ( DEG ) , that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment . However , if we look at the white lid , it had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) . That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler . However , the light gray lid had an average of 45 ( DEG ) in the trials . Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balanced environmetn for the dog to live in .
26525	10	2	2	white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun .In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb . So that's why white is the best color to choose to make anew doghouse .Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun .
26526	10	2	2	"""black :: Black ( darker ) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source ( lamp ) and keep it heated up inside the dog house . Like the """"Air Temperature"""" experiment , the black lid color , had 54 ( DEG ) C while the white lid color had a 42 ( DEG ) C , proving that the darker the color there is , the more heat is absorbed , keeping it more warm ."""
26528	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gray because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't make the doghouse too warm or cold . The data supports this because the jar with the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars , when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar , making it to cold .
26529	10	2	2	white :: it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there . In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26536	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble . The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , 5 ( DEG ) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid , which was the Black lid , and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature .
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the color white , deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler . If the dog house was painted black , it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog house would get hotter .
26545	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . The dark gray had an average temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , and the light gray had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C . Finally , the white had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . So the black jar had the highest temperature ( darkest color ) and the white had the lowest temperature ( brightest color ) . So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26551	10	2	2	black :: This color paint ( Black ) will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house . We know this because the averge of heat in side the jar on Bradi and Jerry exsperiment was 54 ( DEG ) C for black paint and 42 ( DEG ) C for the white paint . So you can see that if you were wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black .
26554	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so that the temperature inside will be cooler , because as tests show , white compared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius .
26556	10	2	2	white :: white reflect the light . when you use white color temperature will lower than when you use dark color . In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42 ( DEG ) C but when you use black the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C . When you use white color temperature was 9 ( DEG ) C lower than when you use dark color .
26558	10	2	2	dark gray :: During each trial it stayed 48 ( DEG ) C Which i snt to hot or cold . It might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some kind of heat . For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but not as much as black . So its fairly compfortable for a dog .
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature . I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold , but not freezing .
26565	10	2	2	white :: it would be the best because it would keep the dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26567	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the doghouse cooler , because it will be only 42 ( DEG ) c inside , then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54 ( DEG ) c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light , and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse .
26568	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold . becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45 ( DEG ) .and that in perfect tempature
26576	10	2	2	white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the average and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the color that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it reflects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre light grey and white .
26583	10	2	2	black :: The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . With a dark gray lid , the average temperature was 48 ( DEG ) C . With alight gray lid , the average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) C . With a white lid , the average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) C . The starting temperature was 24 ( DEG ) C , so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11 ( DEG ) warmer than the white lid . Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm , and also to keep the dog warm in cold temperatures , black would be the best color , because it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar .
26585	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because , based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an average of 45 ( DEG ) . This will help because during the summer when it is hot , it will keep the doghouse cooler . But , it will also help during the winter and keep the dog house warmer .
26587	10	2	2	white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in abetter way than the other three colors because according to the data table the lid color black , dark gray , light gray , all had higher air temperatures . the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar . therefore , white would be abetter color for the doghouse because the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the other three colors .
26591	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps . .when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius . .keeping the doghouse nice and cold . .
26600	10	2	2	black :: the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray , or white because darker colors absorb more energy . this is supported by the data of the experiment hot lamp . the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis , the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis , the average temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 minutes was 45 degrees celsuis , and the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis . this data shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the dog house .
26603	10	2	2	black :: By using black for the color of the dog house , the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors , because darker colors absorb more heat . According to Brandi and Jerry's chart it is true , because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar .
26615	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature ( not too cold or too hot ) because the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the cooler it gets , according too the data in which i got the information .
26623	10	2	2	white :: A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table , the white color's average temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot .
26625	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm . Also , when the weather is cold outside the doghouse will be warm but aslo a bit cool . I know this because when the light gray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average and stayed cool . However the lid was also a bit warm . The lowest temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44 ( DEG ) C while the highest was 46 ( DEG ) C which , if this is the same with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .
26628	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be light gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than black by 8 ( DEG ) and it was 3 ( DEG ) hotter than white which would allow the dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would keep the interior of the dog house cool . The white lid had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C while the black lid got up to 53 ( DEG ) C . Unless you want your dog to be too hot in his or her doghouse , I suggest you paint it white . Also , white looks much better on houses than black , dark grey , or light grey .
26632	10	2	2	light gray :: Using alight gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable . I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days .
26636	10	2	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the light rays , therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat . The black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes , but the white lid had and average of 42 ( DEG ) C air temperature inside the jar , after 10 minutes . This is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C . The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other color of paint .
26637	10	2	2	white :: The color White will affect the dog house , by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much heat , keeping the dog house cooler . The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 ( the coolest temperater ) And the average for black was 53 ( the highest ) the lower the number the cooler it is . White would be the best choice for the doghouse .
26639	10	2	2	light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature at an even or equal rate . If it was cold , it wouldn't keep it as warm , but not super cold either . If it was hot outside , the dog house would keeps orta cool , but not extremely hot either . The average of Black is a high at 53 degrees . which is super hot . Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees .
26647	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse with the color white , because the white lid's average air temperature in the jar was only 42 ( DEG ) C , the lowest temperature of all the lids . This would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler . As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . This is an increase in 11 ( DEG ) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid , and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within the doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all other paint colors tested .
26649	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white , the temperature in the doghouse will not be that high . according to the experiment , using a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low . so by painting the doghouse white , the temperature in the doghouse will stay low .
26653	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors . In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) , while the light gray lid only reached 45 ( DEG ) C . It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors .
26655	10	2	2	black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter . . . .in the expiriment it showed that black is hotter .
26658	10	2	2	white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) , while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45 , 48 , and 53 ( DEG ) . This shows that the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) degrees color on average than the black lid . Therefore , the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in the white house , wheras he could become too hot in the black one .
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black , then it will be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb . example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar .
26675	10	2	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot . For example , when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 42 ( DEG ) C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53 ( DEG ) C .
26676	10	2	2	white :: white will , attract less heat . i say this because , it had the lowest average of 42 ( DEG ) thats 1 ( DEG ) less than gray , 6 ( DEG ) less that dark grey , and 11 ( DEG ) less than black .
26681	10	2	2	white :: The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperature inside the doghouse . This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11 ( DEG ) C .
26685	10	2	2	black :: In the expirement , the jar with the black lid was on average 53 ( DEG ) C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48 ( DEG ) C , 5 ( DEG ) C less than that of the black lid . The jar with a white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C , 11 ( DEG ) C less than the jar with the black lid . To warm up the dog house by just the sunlight Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the temperature within the dog house . Compared to the results with the jars , the black paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement , the black lid warmed up the jar 11 ( DEG ) C more than the jar with the white lid .
26686	10	2	2	white :: I would choose white because , white does not absorb a lot of light so there for , when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse . I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53 . that is an 11 ( DEG ) c difference between the two colors . So for a dog house I highly considered it being white .
26687	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not too cold and not too hot for the dog . The average tempature would probably be around 40-50 ( DEG ) because the light gray lid on the jar had an average 45 ( DEG ) C but a dog house is a different size from ajar so the tempa ture will vary a little .
26688	10	2	2	white :: The best color for the dog house is white . This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house . For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53 ( DEG ) C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48 ( DEG ) C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45 ( DEG ) C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42 ( DEG ) C . Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white .
26691	10	2	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the optimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors , dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature . This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it , and cooler then black in the summer , because it is a lighter shade than black . This will occur from the dark gray paint , because in the experiment , the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53 ( DEG ) . The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42 ( DEG ) . The use of alight gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45 ( DEG ) , and the use of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 ( DEG ) . This shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature , and ideal for a doghouse , because its tempurature was 6 ( DEG ) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure , and 5 ( DEG ) cooler then the hottest tempurature , making dark gray medium in tempurature , and optimal for a dog house .
26693	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the dog house is white because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other color so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house . Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C ( DEG ) DARK GRAY average 48 C ( DEG ) LIGHT GRAY average 45 C ( DEG ) And the WHITE average 42 C ( DEG )
26695	10	2	2	white :: I would choose to paint the dog house white . The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside of the dog house would then be cooler , rather than if you were painting it black . The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 ( DEG ) C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53 ( DEG ) C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11 ( DEG ) C after JUST 10 minutes
26696	10	2	2	black :: This color ( black ) will help the dog house stay/become warmer . Since the dog house is outside , and for the most part its pretty cold outside , the dog house should be black , so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm . Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better . After the 10 minutes , in the experiment , black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius . After the 10 minutes , in the experiment , white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius . So this proves that the darker the color , the more energy it will absorb , making the object warmer .
26701	10	2	2	white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside . Because in the experiment , the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used , so it would be more reasonable to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse .
26703	10	2	2	black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black , it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy . In the investigation , the average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C versus the white which had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , if Brandi and Jerry paint the dog house black , it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
26704	10	2	2	light gray :: The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey . This because the light grey would keep the dog house not as hot during like the summer , and warm enough during the winter . From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment , you can see with darker colors on the lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside . With the light grey it would be not to hot or cold . Another choice would be the white but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter , so light grey is the best choice .
26707	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the doghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent , the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white lid ( 42 ( DEG ) C ) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average air temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid ( 48 ( DEG ) C ) or the black lid which was 53 ( DEG ) C . With the light grey roof , the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse .
26708	10	2	2	white :: It was the lid color that had the coolest temperature . It was 42 ( DEG ) C , 43 ( DEG ) C , 41 ( DEG ) C , and 42 ( DEG ) C .
26709	10	2	2	black :: The color black , might affect the inside of the doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the other colors . I think this because in the data from the experiment , the average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53 ( DEG ) C . The Dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48 ( DEG ) C , the air temperature for light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42 ( DEG ) C . Overall , the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors . In the experiment the black lid had a difference in averages from the coldest air temperature ( the white lid ) by 11 ( DEG ) C .
26734	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light grey , because light grey absorbs more heat than white , but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey . Light gray would be perfect , because during the summer , the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot , so the doghouse would'nt be too warm . During the winter , the light gray would absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the winter . I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did ( where they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature ) they found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( DEG ) C . Finnaly , the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that light gray absorbs some heat , but not alot , so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse .
26737	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray would be better for the dog house because its not to hot but not to cold . The black would be to hot becuse the average was 53 ( DEG ) c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 ( DEG ) c and white at 42 ( DEG ) c . So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48 ( DEG ) c .
26741	10	2	2	black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house . The average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color , white , is 42 degrees , though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm rather than cold .
26745	10	2	2	black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun , the color would absorb the sun , making the dog house a little warmer for the dog to stay in . Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing . Brandi and Jerry did an experiment where they tested colors ( black , dark gray , light gray &amp; white ) and black had an average of 53 degrees C . While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C , that is 12 degrees apart from the black .
26749	10	2	2	light gray :: black absorbs more heat , therefore it will be too warm in the dog house , white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table . During trial 1 white was 42 ( DEG ) while black was 54 ( DEG ) . So if the roof is white the dog will too cool . Therefore the dog house should be light grey , it is a happy medium . On cool days it will still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white , and on hot days it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black .
26752	10	2	2	black :: If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer . The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it . the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse .
26759	10	2	2	white :: white because , the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42 ( DEG ) c . so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white .
26767	10	2	2	black :: Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54 ( DEG ) C ware as white paint was only 42 ( DEG ) C . So there would be an avarge of about 12 ( DEG ) C diffence between the white and black paint .
26768	10	2	2	black :: the darker the color , the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer . and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest . the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26772	10	2	2	white :: The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices . The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42 ( DEG ) C . Which is 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice .
26775	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside . Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid was on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse .
26776	10	2	2	white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black , dark grey , or light gray , the avrage for the white lid is 42 ( DEG ) c , the average for the black is 53 ( DEG ) c , the average for the dark grey is 48 ( DEG ) c , and the average for the light grey is 45 ( DEG ) c so there for white is the best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature . at 42 degrees celsius
26782	10	2	2	"""white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table , """"Lid Color vs . Air Temperature , """" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affected by light . For example , the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42 ( DEG ) C , while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53 ( DEG ) C ."""
26784	10	2	2	white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41 ( DEG ) C . with the paint color as white the air temperature in the doghouse won't get as hot . With a black lid in the previous experiment the average air temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C which is hotter than the white lid by 12 ( DEG ) C .
26793	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white , this will keep the house cool . According to the experiment , the black lid increased the air temperature by 29 ( DEG ) C in 10 minutes , while the white lid only increased it by 18 ( DEG ) C .
26798	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract .The reason black , dark grey , or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages , black is 53 and that is just to high , dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm , light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler than the dark gray but noy much , and then it shows white , and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat .
26799	10	2	2	white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) c . by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11 ( DEG ) c than painting the doghouse black . therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature .
26800	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse is white , it will not become as hot as if it were painted black . The jar with the black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C under the lamp . However , the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C
26801	10	2	2	black :: I think the black paint would work best because it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors . The average temperature was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray , eight degrees higher than the light gray , and eleven degrees higher than the white paint .
26803	10	2	2	white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't .
26805	10	2	2	white :: You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much heat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53 ( DEG ) C , the average for dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) C , The average for light gray was 45 ( DEG ) and the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) C . So in conclution the white paint is 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than black paint . -
26811	10	2	2	white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can not burn up . the temperatre was 42 ( DEG ) and the hight was the black at 53 ( DEG ) . the diffentcies would be 11 ( DEG ) .
26812	10	2	2	black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming the inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging in from 52 ( DEG ) C-54 ( DEG ) C and the lighter colors were in the 40 ( DEG ) C
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer . In each Test , the white lid was proven to stay the coolest , the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1 , 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3 , and 42 for trial 4 .
26820	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best choice in colder climates ( Washington ) because it absorbs more heat . The dog would thusly be warmer if its doghouse was painted black . Inside the jars , blacks average temperature is 53 ( DEG ) C , compared with white which's average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) C . That is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C .
26821	10	2	2	black :: If you use the color black , then the inside of the doghouse will have an increase in temperature . According to the experiment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C . While the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore I can conclude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature . Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse .
26824	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp .
26828	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler . This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog . In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler .
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53 ( DEG ) c . The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) c .
26835	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer . The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white one had 41 degrees .
26838	10	2	2	white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but not stifling hot . the paint had the lowest temp . of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26839	10	2	2	white :: White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color . In the experiment , the white color had the lowest temperature , after 10 minutes , and was 42 ( DEG ) C . The light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , the dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) C , and the black was 53 ( DEG ) C . Since the white had the lowest temperature , it would keep the doghouse coolest , and therefore be the best to use .
26843	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white , or light grey . because in the experiment , the dark grey absorbed more heat , getting an average of 48 degrees C . compared to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42 . Black absorbs more energy , at about 53 degrees C . , but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer .
26845	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog , or too cold . According to the data , the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C while the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53 ( DEG ) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C
26847	10	2	2	black :: Painting the dog house black would make the air inside it warmer . In Brandi and Jerry's experiment , the average air temperate of the can with a black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , whereas the dark gray was only 48 ( DEG ) C , the light gray was only 45 ( DEG ) C , and the white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature .
26848	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white , then it would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outside the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot . The results from the experiment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid the temperature inside the glass jar was 42 ( DEG ) C and all the other temperature averages were a higher temperature than 42 ( DEG ) C .
26859	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse was painted white , in the sum mer when it was very hot outside , then the dog would be able to go into the doghouse where it would be cool inside . I know this because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures . The lighter the color , the cooler it will be inside .
26862	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray . Light gray was in the middle of the data . White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot . The average temperture for white was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average temperture for black was 53 ( DEG ) C . Light gray was the perfect choice because it's average temperture is 45 ( DEG ) C .
26864	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would be white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42 ( DEG ) , 43 ( DEG ) , 41 ( DEG ) , and 42 ( DEG ) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26870	10	2	2	"""white :: White , because you want your dog to be cool enough and according to the """"Lid color vs . Air tempature inside glass jar"""" chart , white is the coolest ."""
26871	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside , than if it was a lighter or darker color . I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53 ( DEG ) , dark grey was the second warmest at 48 ( DEG ) , light grey was next at 45 ( DEG ) , and white was least warmest at 42 ( DEG ) .
26872	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool . In the experiment , the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C and the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
26873	10	2	2	white :: They should make the dog house with a white roof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool , instead of extremely hot . In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C , as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off , instead of using black paint so it is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all .
26876	10	2	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black then the dog would stay warm . As in the experiment it shows that when they used the black lid , the temperature went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 53 ( DEG ) C in 10 minutes . And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24 ( DEG ) C to 42 ( DEG ) C in 10 minutes . This showes that the darker the color , the greater increase in the air temperature , because the darker colors absorb more energy .
26883	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in the summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold .
26886	10	2	2	white :: In the trails , the white lid got the least hot , so the dog house does not get to hot , they should paint it white .
26889	10	2	2	black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most . With the black lid the temperture was 53 ( DEG ) C . With the white lid the temperature was 42 ( DEG ) C . There was 11 ( DEG ) C difference .
26890	10	2	2	white :: i would say white because in the experiment the darker the color the hotter it got . And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot .
26901	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors . In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar , the air temperature will be 53 ( DEG ) C on average and with a white lid , the air temperature would be 42 ( DEG ) C on average . This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11 ( DEG ) C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest .
26902	10	2	2	white :: That color might help to keep the air temperature lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray . This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white ( 42 ( DEG ) ) was lower than the average temperature for black and gray ( 45 ( DEG ) - 53 ( DEG ) ) .
26905	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy , and its temperature would be cooler . In the experiment , the jar with the light , white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest , black lid . A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperature , and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun , and cool in summer .
26908	10	2	2	"""black :: The color """"Black"""" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment , the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors ."""
26909	10	2	2	black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof because in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at an average of 53 ( DEG ) and the onther three colors only in the fortie ( DEG ) range . so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for the dog .
26911	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would be white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot as the black lid . the black lid reached an average of 53 ( DEG ) c , but the white lid only reached 42 ( DEG ) c . also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
26913	10	2	2	white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were painted black or the two shades of gray . the shades of gray and the black paint caused the jar to at least get up to 45 ( DEG ) C and at the most the jar got to 53 ( DEG ) C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white paint for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42 ( DEG ) C when they used the white lid .
26929	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool , but not to cold , and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog . The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) C , while the black jar was 53 ( DEG ) C , and the white jar is 42 ( DEG ) C . So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog .
26930	10	2	2	white :: Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes which is 42 ( DEG ) C
26931	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the color that got the lowest air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar , so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most comfortable .
26932	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the doghouse is white . This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat . The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house . After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp , the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C . But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot , moisty and sweaty .
26937	10	2	2	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white , because black had an average temp of 53 degrees , and the color white had an average temperature of 42 degress . Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer .
26938	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days . The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes alight was 42 ( DEG ) with the white lid .
26943	10	2	2	white :: I woul'd choose white because , The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42 ( DEG ) c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45 ( DEG ) c and Dark Gray is 48 ( DEG ) and , Black at 53 ( DEG ) .So i would have choose the coolest ( least hottest ) one so the dog would not get hot
26945	10	2	2	white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way . The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do . When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42 ( DEG ) C while the color black got to 53 ( DEG ) C . Also , white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42 ( DEG ) C . Which means inside the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as much heat as the other colors do .
26953	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
26954	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color , the cooler the dog house will be causeing it to be more comfertable .The white lid was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C 3 ( DEG ) C coller than the other lids
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the temperature to increase the most . In the experiment the average air temperature in the glass with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , the glass with the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , the glass with the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) C and the glass with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . This proves that if Brandi and Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint . Otherwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse .
26964	10	2	2	white :: White would be the smarter choice , because it reflects heat verses absorbing it . According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside . Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well , because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside . Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house .
26965	10	2	2	white :: I chose the color white for the doghouse . This is because if the darker the color , the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray , dark gray and black . This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer . The darker the color , the greater increase in temperature is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C when the average temperature of the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . The white lid jar was 11 ( DEG ) cooler than the black lid jar .
26967	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose this color for the doghouse because since the doghouse will be located outside , you dont want the dog to be cold at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways . The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air temperature inside the jar . The darker the lid , the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat . Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse . So its not too warm for the dog , but if the dog gets hot , it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep .
26973	10	2	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keeping it cool . In the experiment , white had the average of 42 ( DEG ) C , as for black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , 42 ( white ) is less than 53 ( black ) , so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white .
26976	10	2	2	white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temperature after 10 minutes , painting the dog house white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint . In other words the darker the color the more heat it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house . We want to keep the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat .
26978	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm in side but also it will keep cool when needed , so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool but also warm as well . I know this because with the dark gray average temperature was 48 ( DEG ) c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 ( DEG ) c and the white average was 42 ( DEG ) c .
26979	10	2	2	white :: The color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors , becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment . Whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42 ( DEG ) C . Light gray's average was 45 ( DEG ) C . Dark gray's average was 48 ( DEG ) C . Black's average was 53 ( DEG ) C . That shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot .
26980	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house light gray . If the dog house is painted in light gray , the temperature inside the dog house would not be too hot or too cold . In the result shows that the air temperature with light gray lid is 45 ( DEG ) C , with white it's 42 ( DEG ) C , and with dark gray it's 48 ( DEG ) C . Temperature with light gray is warmer than white lid , but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones .
26985	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best choice . It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture . This is proven by the data gathered by the trials . According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on ajar was 53 ( DEG ) C . When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This proves that white would be abetter temperature control factor .
26986	10	2	2	black :: Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog house warmer inside . In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53 ( DEG ) c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42 ( DEG ) . In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house .
26992	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the doghouse more than the other colors . In the experiment , black heated up an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , while the other colors were never increased more than 48 ( DEG ) C . If it was cold outside , that color would warm the doghouse more because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy .
26995	10	2	2	white :: this color would keep the dog house colder than the other colors because from the recorded data , black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
27004	10	2	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog house would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house . I know this because in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar with the black lid was the hotest .
27006	10	2	2	black :: If they would like the dog to stay warmer , they should chose black because on average , the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid .
27009	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot . It really depends on where the people live and on the season . Dark gray ( 48 ( DEG ) C ) would be more suitable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) , but it also would be warm during the winter , so it's a compromise between the weather . The temperature used for explanation was the average .
27011	10	2	2	black :: If you painted the dog house black , the inside would be hot . Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot . The average for the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) c for black . The average for dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) C and gray was 45 ( DEG ) C . Also white was 42 ( DEG ) C . According to this data , black would make things hot .
27012	10	2	2	white :: having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat , so if you paint the house white , then there wont as much heat on the walls , making the doghouse cooler . this is shown by the fact that in the jar experement , black had the hottest data and white had the coolest .
27016	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold . The average of the four averages was 47 ( DEG ) c so i chose the closest one to 47 ( DEG ) c and dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) c so thats why i chose dark gray .
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the doghouse . One way we know that is , when we did the expiriment with the lid colors , black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius , while white ended up with 42 degrees celcius . This proves that black absorbs the most heat . If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse .
27038	10	2	2	black :: The black paint will make the dog house warmer for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat , with the highest average temperature ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) .
27039	10	2	2	black :: I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse . The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees . Therefore , black is the better color to paint the doghouse .
27042	10	2	2	white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside the doghouse by making it cooler . the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable .
27045	10	2	2	"""black :: the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that""""darker colors absorb more energy ( heat ) """" so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm ."""
27048	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would use dark gray . The darker colors would keep the doghouse warmer . Black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) , whereas white had only 42 ( DEG ) . However , we must remember that a dog is a living thing , and cannot overheat . Dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) . This is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature . So , in conclusion , I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice .
27049	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature . When they did the experiment , the black was the hottest ( 53 ( DEG ) c ) , the dark gray was in the middle ( 48 ( DEG ) c ) , the light gray was also in the middle ( 45 ( DEG ) c ) and the white was the coolest ( 42 ( DEG ) c ) .
27051	10	2	2	white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp . Of 42 ( DEG ) C . It would Be To Hot To Use Black Which Was 53 ( DEG ) C . Inside The Jar .
27057	10	2	2	black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the dog likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what color would be the hotes and the trials number are 54 ( DEG ) , 52 ( DEG ) , 53 ( DEG ) ( ( DEG ) c ) and the average temp . is 53 ( DEG ) c if the dog likes it hot in there
27058	10	2	2	white :: Darker colors usually attract more light . By attracting more light , it usually makes things much warmer . So , if you have the lightest color there is , then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler . According to the data , using a black lid made the jar about 53 degrees , the dark gray made it about 48 degrees , the light gray made it 45 degrees , and the white was about 42 degrees . As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature . So , by using the lightest color , it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint .
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black , their dog will always stay warm , because the color black will give the most heat . I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53 ( DEG ) C and the others were in the low forty's .
27074	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the dog house should be painted black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter . The data shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53 ( DEG ) C when the black lid was used . Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in the glass jar . A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house will be too hot , but as for the winter the black is the correct choice .
27075	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperature . The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( DEG ) , and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42 ( DEG ) . Therefore alight gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors . But if you were to use black or dark gray , it would keep the dog house warmer .
27076	10	2	2	"""white :: The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors , then the dog house will get too hot and your dog will be hot aswell . As the study shown , the color black had an average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did . Same as the color black , dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color """"Dark gray"""" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white . Also in the study , the color light gray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degrees celcious hotter than the color white . The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White because the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made , the avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if they paint their dog house this color , the dog house wouldnt get hot nor your dog ."""
27078	10	2	2	black :: Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors . This is because black absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color . To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the jar warmer than all the rest . It was 6 ( DEG ) C warmer than gray , 10 ( DEG ) C warmer than light gray , and 12 ( DEG ) warmer than white . This clearly shows that black would keep the doghouse warm .
27084	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42 ( DEG ) . and black averged 53 .25 ( DEG ) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white .
27085	10	2	2	white :: While using white for the dog house the dog house would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows that the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did . That way the dog would not be so hot in its house .
27086	10	2	2	black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was .
27090	10	2	2	white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be cool inside during the summer . Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53 ( DEG ) and the white lids average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) , That`s a 11 ( DEG ) difference . So painting the doghouse white would be the best decision of paint .
27100	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs light . Just like with the jar lid when it was black , it absorbed the most . So if you colored the doghouse black it would increase the temperature inside it .
27101	10	2	2	black :: They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold .When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3 ( DEG ) C , copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .Thats a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C .
27104	10	2	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool , as shown in the table from the scenario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) .
27109	10	2	2	"""black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the other colors ( Dark gray , light gray , and white ) , because of the theory that darker colors absorbs more energy ( heat ) ; the inside of the doghouse will be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors . The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because black is the darkest of all the other colors , and darker colors absorbs more energy , also if you look at the data table for the """"Lid color vs . Air temperature inside glass jar"""" experiment , the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53 ( DEG ) C , Dark Gray being 48 ( DEG ) C , Light Gray being 45 ( DEG ) C , and White being 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , black would be the best paint color for the doghouse ."""
27121	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot . in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color .
27123	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot , so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse . I know this because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one . So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse , it will only reach about 42 ( DEG ) C , instead of 45 ( DEG ) C or higher .
27125	10	2	2	white :: The shade white will make the dog house cooler inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black . I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment , the air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors , they're shades . Get it right .
27132	10	2	2	white :: It will affect it by making it cooler than what the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun . The black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) c and the white lid had an average of 42 ( DEG ) c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun .
27133	10	2	2	white :: I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pain the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog . Evidence shows that the darker the color the more hot it gets , for exsample the average temperature for black is 53 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for Dark gray is 48 ( DEG ) , the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 ( DEG ) . The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42 ( DEG ) . I sugest painting the dog house white .
27134	10	2	2	white :: The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways . one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and the dog would enjoy being in it . The data table shows the temperature through a three way trial . the average temperature is 42 ( DEG ) c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
27141	10	2	2	black :: i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black . black is the best color to choose becouse in the test it was an average of 11 ( DEG ) c hotter!
27144	10	2	2	black :: I chose the paint color black because this color would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time . Even on a cloudy or rainy day , Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the sun . After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid , the air 's average temperature raised 29 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature of 24 ( DEG ) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3 ( DEG ) C . The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature raised only 18 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature of 24 ( DEG ) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42 ( DEG ) C . The difference between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the black lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10 ( DEG ) C . This means that the darker the color on an object , the more heat energy the color absorbs , causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it . Therefore , Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the color absorbs .
27147	10	2	2	white :: the white had the lowest temp . in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm .
27157	10	2	2	black :: if you choose a black color for your dog house the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color , because the air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
27159	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color , the less air temperature . The white lid color has an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . The black lid color has an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . The white lid color has 11 ( DEG ) C less heat energy than the black lid color . Therefore , If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer , then they should use the color white since it'll be cooler . . . Vise versa , if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather , then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color . The darker the color , the more heat .
27160	10	2	2	black :: This color ( black ) may effect the inside of the doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer . I say this because in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars . So , I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate , because the black color will absorb the the light and make the dog warmer .
27164	10	2	2	white :: it wont be as hot as the other paints would let heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experiment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27167	10	2	2	white :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white , than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray . The average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) C , while the average temperature for black was 53 ( DEG ) C . The difference of the two was 11 ( DEG ) C , so this proves that white would be the best color to choose .
27168	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the doghouse the coolest , avearg e for white was 42 ( DEG ) C , which would keep the dog from overheating .
27169	10	2	2	white :: If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house , because black dog houses get hoter and faster , than white dog house . If it was white it would stay around 40 ( DEG ) instead of 44 ( DEG ) , 48 ( DEG ) , and 55 ( DEG ) .
27173	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder . In the experiment black paint made the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27179	10	2	2	"""dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm . The reason I know this is because in the expi rament """"Hot lamp"""" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees . which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Light gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid which was 53 ( DEG ) C"""
27181	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color , the cooler the dog will be . When the lid color was at it's darkest ( black ) the average temperature was 53 degrees celcius . When the lid color was at it's lightest ( white ) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius . If Brandi and Jerry want to keep their dog cool , they should use white paint .
27198	10	2	2	white :: The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white .White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day , so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated . I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows , which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42 ( DEG ) C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C which was the highest temperature ( which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day , and that would be bad for the dog ) . So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse .
27199	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think that if you choose a color to dark , then it might make the dog really hot , so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold . Dark gray has trials that are 48 ( DEG ) C which is hot . However , it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54 ( DEG ) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41 ( DEG ) . So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house .
27200	10	2	2	white :: if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture , average tempature was 42 ( DEG ) c for white , unlike the black were that is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53 ( DEG ) c . if they want cool for the doghouse then use the white .
27203	10	2	2	white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black , the dog house will be cooler . the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one .
27207	10	2	2	black :: The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house . In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius . For the lowest color , white , it was 42 degrees celcius . This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up the house .
27210	10	2	2	white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot . in the experiment black which was the darkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white ( the lightest color ) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27216	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot , and it would still be abetter color than white for cold nights . This is true because the average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average temperature for the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C
27217	10	2	2	white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot , so I would choose white . The average was 42 ( DEG ) C , since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house .
27218	10	2	2	white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature . This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse .
27223	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too . The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53 ( DEG ) C , but the white is 42 ( DEG ) C which is ok for the winter and the summer .
27226	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color , because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black , dark gray , or light gray . White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above . and the average temperatrure for white was 42 ( DEG ) C , light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) C , and black was 53 ( DEG ) C . That shows that white was the coldest color while being shined on by light . Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse .
27229	10	2	2	black :: brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black if they want the dog to stay warm , because black absorbed the most heat at an average of 53 .25
27231	10	2	2	white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 degrees . and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees . and thus the doghouse will be cooler
27233	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keeping it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter . in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral .
27237	10	2	2	white :: if the doghouse is painted white the air temperature will be lower than light gray , dark gray , or black . the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C . the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C . and the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C . therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler .
27238	10	2	2	white :: If the color is a dark color then the temperature will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade . White was the color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and that would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature .
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42 ( DEG ) C and dogs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27244	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because from the results of the experiment , white had the lowest average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day .
27245	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the dog house because in the summer , when it's really hot , the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black , it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there . Also , the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time , the temperature will be really cold , but it would be dark enough to keep warm . So in conclusion , light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter . Some evidence is that in the experiment , the average for the light grey was 45 ( DEG ) C and the average for the black was 53 ( DEG ) C . The light gray kept cool while the black did not . So during the summer , the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house . If they had alight grey house , they would have a nice cool house to lounge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winter as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
27249	10	2	2	white :: The color white would be a good color for doghouse because it heats up the air in it the least . In the experiment , the color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42 ( DEG ) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53 ( DEG ) C .
27254	10	2	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse , but not too warm . The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm . thought it might be too hot for the dog .
27257	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because black is the darkest color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors absorb more heat . As for white is would get the least amount of heat . Main reason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be cold , so it will be warm but not too hot .
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one . The results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid , and the same would apply to a doghouse .
27262	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black . He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . In the jar with the white lid , the average tempature was 42 ( DEG ) C . It will be 11 ( DEG ) C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one . That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight .
27267	10	2	2	white :: white would be best because it reflects more energy , the table shows that the average temp . after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid .
27270	10	2	2	white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 ( DEG ) c and the lowest was 41 ( DEG ) c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 ( DEG ) c cooler then the black , dark grey or light grey
27276	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer . This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color .
27287	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just right . It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold . The average ( DEG ) C was 48 ( DEG ) C , the lowest average wsa 42 ( DEG ) C and the highest average was 53 ( DEG ) C .
27291	10	2	2	light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24 ( DEG ) c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold .
27296	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot summer day more than a darker color such as black . white was on averge 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than black .
27298	10	2	2	light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house based on the results is light gray . I said light gray because it was average 45 ( DEG ) C . it is not too hot and not too cold . If you painted the dog house light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm . The black lid was average 53 ( DEG ) C . it got hotter because the color was darker . the dark gray was average 48 ( DEG ) C . it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark . the light gray was average 45 ( DEG ) C . it got cooler because the lid color was lighter . The white lid averaged 4 2 ( DEG ) C because it was the lightest , and dark colors absorb more heat .
27299	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do . Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 .
27303	10	2	2	white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors . In average 42 ( DEG ) C . Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer .
27305	10	2	2	light gray :: The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool , but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm . In the experiment , the color light grey had a temperature that was 21 ( DEG ) higher than the starting temperature of 24 ( DEG ) , but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24 ( DEG ) and 30 ( DEG ) from the original temperature of 24 ( DEG ) .
27306	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42 ( DEG ) C . This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
27308	10	2	2	black :: Black was the highest tempature when under the lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose black because black had an avrage of 53 ( DEG ) c insted of other averages like 48 ( DEG ) c 45 ( DEG ) c and 42 ( DEG ) c
27313	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth . Dark Gary had A 48 ( DEG ) c avg And The Darkest is black which HAd a 53 ( DEG ) c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42 ( DEG ) c avg
27316	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because , based on the experiment , dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't . The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment ( 53 ( DEG ) c ) was from the jar with the black lid , and the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ( DEG ) c ) was from the jar with the white lid , proving that light colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do .
27319	10	2	2	white :: By painting the dog house white , it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler . This is proven because in each trial , white had the lowest temperature . For example , in the experiment , White's average tempurate was 42 ( DEG ) , compared to black's average , which was 53 ( DEG ) ; a huge difference!
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse . the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the black lid
27322	10	2	2	light gray :: I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid .
27325	10	2	2	white :: They might use white because it doesnt get hot as fast as the other colors do . In the data table it shows that the first trail was 42 ( DEG ) C the second trial was 43 ( DEG ) C the third was 41 ( DEG ) C and the fourth was 42 ( DEG ) C . For all the other colors the trials got higher than 43 ( DEG ) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house because it doesnt get as hot .
27331	10	2	2	white :: This color would make the dog house 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than than if it was a black color . So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house . In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest , and they said dark colors absorb more heat , so white would be an appropriate color .
27333	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the doghouse to a comfortable temperature . According to the results of the experiment , the colors were in this order ( from the highest to lowest temperature ) : black , dark gray , light gray , white . Dogs do not normally enjoy hot , stuffy enviornments . They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated , and get very uncomfortable . This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated , but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the experiment results .
27336	10	2	2	black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat . In the lab , black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27340	10	2	2	black :: Black because the black had the highest number the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other color
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effect by not making it hot like other colors . In the experiment , they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 ( DEG ) . The black lid was 53 ( DEG ) , the dark gray was 48 ( DEG ) , and lastly , the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) . Therefore , we can conclude that the white attracts the least sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less .
27346	10	2	2	white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar the coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer . the insidde of the b jar with the black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42 ( DEG ) c
27348	10	2	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black , dark gray and light gray , because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do . For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) c while the inside tempeture of ajar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42 ( DEG ) c . The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) c less than the jar did with the black lid .
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the inside of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better . In Brandi and Jerry's experiment the average temperature for the black lid jar was 53 ( DEG ) C , 5 ( DEG ) C more than the next warmest one , dark gray .
27356	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditions in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they put the black lid on the jar . So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color .
27357	10	2	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hotter it will be , so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the winter you dont want it to be white . so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer it wont attract as much as the black would
27360	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summer it may become warm for the dog , so black would be too hot . In the winter black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside . So for an all around the year comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median between them both .
27362	10	2	2	light gray :: Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold . The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42 ( DEG ) C . In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well . Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53 ( DEG ) C . However , even though according to the experiment , the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool . The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid , but only by 3 ( DEG ) C , therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid . The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer , but remain warm in the winter .
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat , therefore keeping the dog warm throughout the year . the average temperature inside the jar with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius , while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower .
27368	10	2	2	black :: The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter . The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors . The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54 ( DEG ) c and the coldest for black was 52 ( DEG ) c . The least warmest was the color white . The highest temperature was 43 ( DEG ) c . the lowest was 41 ( DEG ) c . I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter . White would not be as warm as black is .
27370	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53 , dark gray:48 , light gray:45 , and white:42 .
27372	10	2	2	white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54 ( DEG ) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41 ( DEG ) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house .
27374	10	2	2	white :: A white colored doghouse will make the air temperature warmer in warm temperature , but the light color will not make the temperature go up a lot . With the black lid color , the temperature of the air inside the jar was adn average of 53 ( DEG ) after ten minutes . The white jar was and average of 42 ( DEG ) after ten minutes . Since both jars started at 24 ( DEG ) , the temperature of the black jar increased 29 ( DEG ) while the temperature of the white only increased 18 ( DEG ) . The darker the color of something , the more heat the object absorbs . That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse , even though that doghouse will warm up as well .
27376	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42 ( DEG ) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray , and light gray doghouses were 53 ( DEG ) , 48 ( DEG ) , and 45 ( DEG ) respectively .
27378	10	2	2	white :: white had the lowest temperature so the doghouse wont get extremely hot .
27382	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid , the air temperature inside the jar was the lowest . It seemed that the lighter the color , the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was after 10 minutes . This would be the best color for a dog house because if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime , having a white painted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead .
27383	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly , while painting the doghouse a darker color will raise the temperature significantly . In the Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table , the temperature inside the jar with the white lid , raised an average of 18 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes . The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes . If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool , then they would paint the doghouse white . If they wanted the temperature to be warm , they would paint the doghouse black . I would paint the doghouse white .
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors . Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors .
27389	10	2	2	white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more cooler . I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42 ( DEG ) C which is the lowest while the black had 54 ( DEG ) C which is the highest .
27390	10	2	2	white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghouse cooler inside . for example , the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42 ( DEG ) than the black lid; 53 ( DEG )
27400	10	2	2	white :: White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins . under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o , 11 degrees colder than the hottest paint color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53 .
27404	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color , dark gray , would affect the doghouse because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature . This way , the doghouse would be around 48 ( DEG ) . The doghouse would not be too hot ( 53 ( DEG ) ) , as it would be with the color black , but the doghouse would not be too cold ( 42 ( DEG ) ) , as it would be with the color white .
27409	10	2	2	white :: It wil make it so the air inside of the doghouse will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot . I knowjthis because the data shows the averge temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) c .
27411	10	2	2	black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer because in the experiment the darker the color , the warmer it will be inside .
27416	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray is the best color for the dog house because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold . The black had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C which is too hot for a dog in the summer . it needs to be at a relaxing temperature which is 45 ( DEG ) C for the light gray . If i were to choose the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in . The light gray color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his little house .
27417	10	2	2	black :: The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer , keeping the dog warm at night . The average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) , while the white was 42 ( DEG ) . The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11 ( DEG ) higher than the white paint .
27419	10	2	2	black :: Clack absorbs more heat energy , so it would make the doghouse a warmer place for the dog . The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8 ( DEG ) C more than the other colored lids . That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then it would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside . In the experiment it was 53 ( DEG ) C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 ( DEG ) C on average when the lid of the jar was white .
27425	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray paint , but cooler in the summer than the black paint would . The experiment supports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , while the highest average data , the black paint , was a temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C , too hot , and the lowest average data , the white paint , was 42 ( DEG ) C , too cold for the dog .
27427	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse . Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't be too cold or too warm for a dog . A white doghouse was 42 degrees which might make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too warm . Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53 , much too warm .The refore light gray would be the best color .
27430	10	2	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog house because according to the experiment white was the color that the inside of the jar would be less hot . Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the white lid had a temperature 42 ( DEG ) C inside the jar and the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog house .
27435	10	2	2	black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat . Knowing this information , for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse , Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black .
27436	10	2	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse has a warm climate , the white paint color will be more likely to keep the temperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler , or lower , temperature . This can be said because the white paint color , on average , made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C , compared to 53 ( DEG ) C for black paint , 48 ( DEG ) C for dark gray paint , and 45 ( DEG ) C for light gray paint . It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so that the dog , that stays inside the doghouse , doesn't overheat .
27437	10	2	2	white :: They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed . As shown in the table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature .
27438	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color will effect the dog house by keeping it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in the winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar the same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48 ( DEG ) C .
27439	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray , because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will help the dog stay cool but also warm . It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48 ( DEG ) C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time . Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6 ( DEG ) C average .
27440	10	2	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that white dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray , light gray and black . also , because blacks average ( in ( DEG ) c ) was 53 dark grays average was 48 . light grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42 . leaving that white will leave the dog house cooler .
27442	10	2	2	black :: Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within . Out of all the colors of white , dark gray , light gray , black and white , black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53 ( DEG ) C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other . However , you must also consider where the doghouse is being placed . If the doghouse should be placed outdoors , black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold winters . If placed indoors , the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm .
27447	10	2	2	white :: This color effects the dog house because it makes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment .In there experiment the white lid was the coolest .
27448	10	2	2	white :: The best color to paint the top of the doghouse would be white . In the experiment , on average the black lid absorbed 5 3 ( DEG ) C , dark gray:48 ( DEG ) C , light gray:45 ( DEG ) C , white:42 ( DEG ) C . The black lid absorbed 11 ( DEG ) more heat than the white lid . By painting the top of the doghouse white , it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse .
27450	10	2	2	light gray :: In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use alight grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature .
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data , white had the lowest temperature average of 42 , while others have an average of 45 , 48 , and 53 . It all depends on the dog you are getting , if its fur is dark , better to get light colors so it can be cooler .
27464	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the doghouse because according to the results of the experiment , Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 ( DEG ) , dark gray made it 48 ( DEG ) , light gray made it 44 ( DEG ) , and white made it 42 ( DEG ) . They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest , that way the dog doesn't ov erheat .
27465	10	2	2	white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat .
27466	10	2	2	white :: White , because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids , and from the data table it shows that black ( 53degr ees ) was the highest , and white ( 42degrees ) was the lowest . So if they want a to paint the dog house , they should paint it white , do to , the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in .
27469	10	2	2	black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy . black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and color of the lid it got an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . the lightest color ( white ) got an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors . i know this because in the experiment , the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29 .
27475	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would be cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42 ( DEG ) c and blacks average is 53 ( DEG ) c
27476	10	2	2	white :: that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time . i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42 , so thats more than a 10 ( DEG ) c difference .
27481	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons . The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C . That makes the temperature of the doghouse in general , not to hot and not to cool based on the jar experiment .
27482	10	2	2	white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than darker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C and inside the black lid it was 53 ( DEG ) C , that is 11 ( DEG ) C warmer .
27483	10	2	2	black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog , because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors . For example , the average for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , but the average for the white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C . Which is a lot less . So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white .
27485	10	2	2	white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside . I know this because in the experiment the black lid got to be the hottest at 54 ( DEG ) C well white was the coolest at 42 ( DEG ) C . White was also cooler then dark gray at 48 ( DEG ) C and light gray at 44 ( DEG ) C . So white would be the coolest for the doghouse .
27490	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy . Their hypothesis was correct . This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute trials was 42 degrees . Because black was the darkest color of the lid , it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid . ) Thus , because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated , the best color to paint it would be white because white would absorb the least heat .
27491	10	2	2	black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by making it a warmer environment for the dog . Plus if it is a cold winter , the doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer . The data table shows that using the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12 ( DEG ) higher then the white lid , about 10 ( DEG ) higher in temperature than the light gray lid , and about 6 ( DEG ) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial . The average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C for the black lid , the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average temperature for the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer .
27497	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the doghouse would be white . Inside of the doghouse , the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray . The average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , but for the white lid , it was 42 ( DEG ) C . The white lid made the air 11 ( DEG ) cooler than the black lid .
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color , but black is a dark color so it will get hotter . In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on .
27512	10	2	2	light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt too light and is not too dark . Light gray will cause the dog house to be at a comfortable temperature . If it was white , it would be too cold and if it was black , then it would be too hot . In the experiment , light gray ha dan average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C while white had 42 ( DEG ) C and black had 53 ( DEG ) C .
27514	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat . In Summer , you wouldn't want the dog house to be over-heated . The white color had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C while the black color was 53 ( DEG ) C , this is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C between the two colors .
27516	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be a good color , because in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement , white gave a cooler temperature than the others , so the doghouse could be colder than warmer .
27518	10	2	2	light gray :: This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days . On average , the heat inside the jar with alight gray ( 45 ( DEG ) C ) was cooler than that of Black ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) and dark gray ( 48 ( DEG ) C )
27522	10	2	2	white :: White could be a color for the doghouse . It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is . Also , in the experiment , white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors . 42 ( DEG ) C , 43 ( DEG ) C , 41 ( DEG ) C , and 42 ( DEG ) C . Where as the other colors , black , dark gray , and light gray , all had higher temperatures . The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 ( DEG ) C , the color black . To the lowest temperature , 41 ( DEG ) C for the color white .
27526	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse because the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four . White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees .
27527	10	2	2	light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color . It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog . During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature of 53 ( DEG ) C . The white lid created a temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium .
27528	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the inside of the dog house because , it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature . I think white is the best paint color to use because , it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy .
27529	10	2	2	white :: white would make the dog house less hot . the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1 , 2 , and 3 .
27531	10	2	2	white :: The color white wouldn't absorb as much energy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm . With a black lid , the jar was an average temperture was 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes . With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that the lighter the color , the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house . Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog , and therefore making white the right color .
27534	10	2	2	white :: A white color would keep it cooler because , according to the data , white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degrees celcius , while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degrees celcius .
27543	10	2	2	black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the lid was white it was 42 dagrees
27544	10	2	2	white :: The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog . As shown in the data white is the coolest . The average for a black lid is 53 ( DEG ) C . The dark gray lid is 48 ( DEG ) C the light gray lid is 45 ( DEG ) C and the white lid is 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog .
27551	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color because it wouldn't be too cold nor to hot . in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48 ( DEG ) c
27553	10	2	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the end of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27555	10	2	2	white :: White would be better for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did . white only absorbed an average of 42 ( DEG ) c , where black absorbed an average of 53 ( DEG ) c .
27556	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold . Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold . In an Air temperature expirement , four colors were measured; Black , Dark Gray , Light Gray , and White . The Data measured Black as 53 ( DEG ) C , Dark Gray as 48 ( DEG ) C , Light Gray 45 ( DEG ) , and White 42 ( DEG ) C . Dark Gray as you see isn't too warm , neither too cold , making it the best color for the doghouse .
27557	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would make the doghouse colder than if they used black paint . As was shown by the table , the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the black lid was 11 ( DEG ) C warmer than the jar with the white lid . Thus , using white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint .
27559	10	2	2	white :: The black was 9 ( DEG ) C warmer then the white colored paint . The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog . The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer .
27560	10	2	2	white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11 ( DEG ) C . the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53 ( DEG ) C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27566	10	2	2	light gray :: Alight gray paint on the doghouse might provide some heat in the winter , while not making it too hot in the summer . That is shown by the data , in the 20 ( DEG ) C increase in temp . Dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer , because of the average increases of 24 ( DEG ) C for dark gray and 29 ( DEG ) C for black . A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter , shown by the meager 18 ( DEG ) C increase . However , on the other hand this experiment isn't closley applicable . the doghouse would not likely be made of glass , and sealed off from outside air curculation . Also , the sun burns many different gases , providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp , in addition to being brighter . The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles . - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the doghouse , one of each color , and circulate them during the year , with white in the summer and black in the winter , and the other two scattered between .
27568	10	2	2	light gray :: it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an average of 45 ( DEG ) Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 ( DEG ) Celsius making an 8 ( DEG ) Celsius difference between the two .
27569	10	2	2	black :: The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus , Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog house black . According to the results from the experiment , the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53 . The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy .
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house absorb more heat , making the dog house warmer . I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results , the black paint retained the most heat in the glass jar .
27576	10	2	2	white :: The white paint color would be cooler because on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot , so the dog would just go in his dog house . The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat . Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun . The experiment tells it all , the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40 ( DEG ) c as the other colors went up to 45 , 48 , and 53 . The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest . Coming to a solution the white paint would be the best to use for a dog house .
27577	10	2	2	black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest ( around 40 ) . If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties . If the doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties . If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties . If the doghouse was black it would be in the low fifties . White would reflect the light and not heat up the doghouse as much as any other color .
27583	10	2	2	light gray :: Painting the doghouse light gray would keep the doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter . I know this because the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar , the cooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27592	10	2	2	white :: White does not absord as much light as a darker color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be . In the experiment , the lowest temperature average was white with 42 ( DEG ) . The next temperature was light gray with 45 ( DEG ) , after that it just goes up higher
27593	10	2	2	black :: I would pick black .This color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm .My support is that in the data table it shows that the Average temperature for the color black inside a glass jar was 53 ( DEG ) C And the lowest temperature was white and whites Av rage data was42 ( DEG ) C . Dark Grey and Light Grey had a median of 48 ( DEG ) C for Dark Grey and 45 ( DEG ) C for Light grey .This shows that the Black color would keep the dog the most warmest
27596	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black . The averge temp . for the color black was 53 ( DEG ) C , and the average temp . for the color white was 42 ( DEG ) C . The difference between them is 11 ( DEG ) .
27597	10	2	2	white :: White paint would keep the doghouse cool . You know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp .
27602	10	2	2	black :: Black could affect the inside of the dog house because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog won't get cold . I think this is true because according to the data the average temperature of a black color was 53 ( DEG ) C , which was the high data and the average temperature for the white color was only 42 ( DEG ) C , which is the low data . And the black temperature was 11 ( DEG ) warmer then the white temperature . so that means the black color will keep the dog warm .
27603	10	2	2	black :: if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth . the average temperature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was only 42 degrees .
27608	10	2	2	black :: This color will keep the dog house warmer because it has a lower albedo . Also in the experiment it had the highest of the Average tempertures with 53 ( DEG ) .
27613	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse would make the doghouse warmer on the inside . In Brandi and Jerry's experiment , using a black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , while the othere lighter colors had ave rages of 48 , 45 , and 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color .
27615	10	2	2	white :: The color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors obsorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53 ( DEG ) c and the white lid averaged a 42 ( DEG ) c , wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature .
27621	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color beacause it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot . Acording to the data table white got the lowest average air tempature for how hot it gets but black got the most highest .
27622	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house white because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar , and its average was 42 ( DEG ) C . This way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get to hot .
27624	10	2	2	white :: The wite paint will keep the dog house cooler , because in the experiment , the white paint had the lowest tempurature after ten minuutes , being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint , with at emp of 54 degrees .
27629	10	2	2	white :: The color of the dog house could affect the temperature makeing the dog house cooler . this is true because in the experiment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42 ( DEG ) c .
27631	10	2	2	white :: White will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and won't burn up . After 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
27633	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature . In the experement , the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . If the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in .
27634	10	2	2	white :: The inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder . In the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( DEG ) C . In trial 3 it had 41 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of white was 42 ( DEG ) C the lowest average out of every color .
27635	10	2	2	"""white :: The best paint color for the doghouse is white because the temperature is not too hot when put under light . Black would not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 ( DEG ) C ; which is too hot . White paint however has an average of 42 ( DEG ) C when put under a lamp for ten minutes . This means that with a white doghouse , the dog wouldn't over heat ."""
27637	10	2	2	white :: Because in the summer , the white color will d eflect the sun's heat , keeping the doghouse 10 ( DEG ) cooler than if you would paint it black , because in the experiment , the air temperature inside of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40's , while the jar with the black lid stayed in the low-mid 50's , proving the white deflects he at , while black asorbs it .
27642	10	2	2	black :: The black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter , just like how the black jare lid heated the air in the jar 11 ( DEG ) C higher than the jarwith a white lid .
27643	10	2	2	light gray :: the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot . i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
27644	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray is a good color to choose because it won't be too hot in the summer and won't be too cold in the winter . The light gray was the 2nd coldest jar .
27645	10	2	2	white :: the color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot .In the expirement it says that it got down to 4 1 ( DEG ) C .And the lowest for others was 44 ( DEG ) C .
27651	10	2	2	white :: the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder . A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees .
27652	10	2	2	white :: this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer .becaus the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in air tempeture . . .
27656	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the inside of the dog house to be cooler . The average of the three trials for white was lower than the average of the other colors , white was 3 ( DEG ) c cooler than light gray and as much as 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than the black .
27659	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse was painted white , the inside of the doghouse wouldn't get to hot for the dog . This is because in the data table the average temerature for the light gray lid color was 42 ( DEG ) C . Also , if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other c olors , the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy .
27662	10	2	2	white :: I think the best paint color for the doghouse is white . I believe that since white is the lighest color of paint they have , it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler . The lighter the color , the less heat it will asorb . In the data , the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42 ( DEG ) C . For black , the darkest color lid they had , the average temperature of the air was 53 ( DEG ) C . That's a total difference of 11 ( DEG ) C .
27670	10	2	2	black :: I would choose black for the paint color because the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse . The black lid had an average tempurature of 53 ( DEG ) C , which was the highest average tempurature out of all the lids , and the white had a tempurature of 42 ( DEG ) C , which was the lowest . They had a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C , meaning that the black paint would keep the doghouse warmer .
27676	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold . The data shows that the average tempreaure of the pain is as follows Black:53 ( DEG ) c Dark Grey:48 ( DEG ) c Light Grey:45 ( DEG ) c White:42 ( DEG ) c so you see that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light , so it wont be to hot or to cold in there . . . the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat .
27680	10	2	2	white :: It will keep it the coolest out of all the co lors . The temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colrs were rangeing to 44 to 54 ( DEG )
27683	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog . According to the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage air temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
27684	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint thier doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the summer . the data shows that the white lids average heat temperture was about 42 C and the black was about 53 C . white was 11 degrees cooler .
27685	10	2	2	black :: with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat . In the experiment the temperature for the black lid was always the highest .
27686	10	2	2	black :: That color would provide the warmest environment for the dog in the doghouse , because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid reached an average of 53 ( DEG ) , which was 5 ( DEG ) more than the next highest temperature . ( 48 ( DEG ) )
27691	10	2	2	white :: The average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees . This is the lowest temperature out of the four colors ( Black , Dark gray , Light gray and White ) . Using the color White would reflect the suns heat , causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat . Therefore , creating a safe doghouse habitat .
27693	10	2	2	white :: the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the expiriment the white lid always had the lowest temperature .
27701	10	2	2	white :: By making the doghouse white , the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color . In the experiment Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar , the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes of heating . The jar with the black lid , however , was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes of heating . The jar with the white lid was an average of 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid . Therefor , the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse .
27703	10	2	2	white :: The color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler . Acording to the experiment black got 53 ( DEG ) C and white got 42 ( DEG ) C so it should do the same with the dog house .
27705	10	2	2	"""white :: I would choose black because in the """"Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"""" Table It Showed That White was Colder than black and The rest Of the darker colors . For example the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average for black was 5 3 ( DEG ) C ."""
27710	10	2	2	dark gray :: i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it wont be to hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm inough be cause the air inside in ajar like it shows in lid color vs . air temperature inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or to warm is dark gray and light gray so eather of them is fine because u wouldnt want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
27711	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the doghouse cool and not hot . When Brandi and Jerry put the white lid on , the average temperature inside the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . When they put the black jar on , the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C .
27717	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best choise because it attracts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid only got up to 43 ( DEG ) Cat the highest , and the black lid got up to 54 ( DEG ) Cat the highest . And the dark grey and light grey were inbetween .
27718	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse . I know this because the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45 ( DEG ) C .
27720	10	2	2	black :: painting your dog house this color will affect the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the results the kids who did this project .0
27723	10	2	2	light gray :: If they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat as it did in the lamp experiment .
27727	10	2	2	black :: i would chose a black for the doghouse beacus e the air temperature would be hotter , therefore keeping the dog warmer in the winter time . i know this because in brandi and jerry's experiment , when the lid was black , the average air temperature was 53 ( DEG ) celsius , and when the lid was white , the average air temperature was 42 ( DEG ) celcius ,
27729	10	2	2	white :: It would keep the doghouse cool in the summer . after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average , only 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the black lid however had an aver age of 53 ( DEG ) C after ten minutes . This would be much too hot for the dog .
27733	10	2	2	black :: It would increase the temperature of the doghouse , especially when close to light . Because darker colors make more heat . For ecample , when Brandi and Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs . Black had the highest amount of heat . This is mostly because its an energy transfer . When light hits darker colors , it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy .
27734	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray could effect the tempature of the doghouse because draker colors absorb more heat than light colors do . If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house black , the house would absorb too much heat since in the data the average was 53 ( ( DEG ) C ) , if you chose dark gray the average tempatrure was 48 ( ( DEG ) C ) which could still be too warm . If you chose light gray , its average was 45 ( ( DEG ) C ) which is right in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white , the average was 42 ( ( DEG ) C ) which could be too cold in the winter time . Therefore , using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time .
27737	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would atract more energy than white which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray .
27742	10	2	2	black :: Using black paint to paint a doghouse would absorb more heat , as the data from the experiment shows . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid heated up to 53 ( DEG ) on average , while white only heated up to 42 ( DEG ) on average .
27743	10	2	2	white :: white is the best choice of color because the average temputre was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the dog house would be cooler with white pant
27746	10	2	2	black :: if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment , the darker the color , the more hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy .
27751	10	2	2	white :: White is the best choice since the highest te mperaure was in the black jar at 54 ( DEG ) , and the lowest was in the white jar at 43 ( DEG ) showing an 11 ( DEG ) difference , keeping the dog less hot in his house .
27753	10	2	2	white :: I think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark . The average temperature of black lided jars was 53 ( DEG ) . The average of the white jars was 42 ( DEG ) . The dogs should live in a house that wont absorb too much energy so they wont overheat .
27755	10	2	2	white :: They should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would always be hot .
27764	10	2	2	black :: If you were to chose black as your paint color , it woul warmer than the dark gray , light gray and white . In this experiment black got about 53 ( DEG ) C and the white got 42 ( DEG ) C .
27771	10	2	2	white :: The white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lid's average temp . was 42 ( DEG ) C and the black lid's average temp . was 53 ( DEG ) C . that is an 11 ( DEG ) differance for the dog to feel .
27773	10	2	2	white :: The white paint color will reflect off heat and not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint color for the summer . The white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2 ( DEG ) C , while the black paint color average for the temperatue is 53 ( DEG ) C .
27776	10	2	2	black :: I chose the color black for the doghouse because from the data collected , black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C compared to the lowest temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C for the color white . The dog in the house will stay warmer because black is the warmest color which I know by looking at the data Brandi and Jerry collected .
27778	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because it will keep the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremely hot place . The average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45 ( DEG ) C . So it is enough to keep the dog warm , but not enough to make it uncomfortable .
27779	10	2	2	white :: White reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors . It also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids . This would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside .
27783	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color I think would be the best color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray and warmer than the white . From the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C while the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C . The white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The white color would keep the dog cool but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm when needed .
27786	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog . Acording to the data table shown , it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors .
27787	10	2	2	white :: i belive white will work the best because it doesnt conduct as much heat as the orther ones did: for exsample:b lack , drak grey , light gray , all got imbetween 44 and 54 well while the white paint only got 42-41 and 42 as an aveage
27788	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey , light grey or white roof . In the expirement , when Brandi and Jerry used the black lid , the temperature got up to 54 ( DEG ) c and with the dark grey lid , it only got up to 48 ( DEG ) c , with the light grey lid , the tempertature got up to 46 ( DEG ) c , and with the white lid , the temperature only got up to 43 ( DEG ) c , so most likely the black roof would make the inside of the dog house hot .
27789	10	2	2	black :: A black roof will keep the doghouse warm .The average temperature of the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , but the average for the next highest color was 48 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , a black roof will keep the dog at least 5 ( DEG ) C warmer than any other color .
27791	10	2	2	white :: I chose white becuase it's the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur , so then they can escape the sun in a shady , cool dog house .There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees C and white whos highest was 43 . In the winter they will have a big fur coat , so they won't need it warm inside their dog house , plus there isn't as much sun . If its too cold they can go inside the house .
27795	10	2	2	light gray :: I think Light Gray would be the best paint color because it's not going to make the dog house that hot but you also don't want it to be to cold so it's a comfortable temperature .Light Gray averaged about 45 ( DEG ) C while white averaged 42 ( DEG ) C , Dark Gray at 48 ( DEG ) C , and Black at 53 ( DEG ) C .
27796	10	2	2	light gray :: It will keep the dog warm but not as hot as using Black or Dark Grey paint , The average temp for Black is 53 ( DEG ) and the average for the Light Grey paint is 45 ( DEG ) an 8 ( DEG ) difference .
27800	10	2	2	white :: White paint would effect the dog house because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed . According to the data , the difference in temperature would be around 11 degreees Centigrade then the black colour . So the white colour would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse .
27801	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark gray is the best choice because its not to hot and its not to cold . The average tempture is 48 ( DEG ) c and the other are 53 , 45 and 42
27804	10	2	2	white :: The best color to paint a dog house would be white becuase white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature . My support to my statement is in trial 1 The white white lid jar was the least in temperature becuase the white lidded jar was 42 ( DEG ) C and the Light gray lidded jar was 44 ( DEG ) C and the Dark Gray lidded jar was 48 ( DEG ) C and the Black lidded jar was 54 ( DEG ) C also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars . So Brandi and Jerry should pick White to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too hot and die .
27805	10	2	2	white :: the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because , in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter . but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house .
27810	10	2	2	white :: By choosing a white color for the dog house it will keep the dog cooler . I know this because in the experiment the average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53 , but the average temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42 . Therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house .
27811	10	2	2	white :: The best color for the doghouse would be white , because it absorbs less energy than a black color , and the black lid average was 53 ( DEG ) C and the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C .
27817	10	2	2	white :: The dog house will be cooler if painted White and more comfortable for a dog . In the experiment the temperatures for the jars ( in ( DEG ) C ) with the black lid were 53 , dark gey 48 , light grey 45 , and white 42 . The White was 11 ( DEG ) C less than the hottest jar ( Black )
27819	10	2	2	light gray :: the color of the paint on the doghouse will affect it in many ways . to begin with , it will change the temperature of the doghouse . if the doghouse were black , then it would absorb alot of the energy radiating from the sun . because darker colors hold heat more . the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse . making the temperature cooler then if it were painted darker . the dark grey is going to keep it warm , but not as hot as the black paint would . and the light grey would keep it cooler , but not as cool as the white would . so it would all depend on were you lived . and what temperature best suited your pet . the darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat . and the lighter col ors are going to reflect more of it off . i would choose light grey for my doghouse though . because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white .
27820	10	2	2	dark gray :: If i were to paint a dog house the color i would choose would be dark grey .Because black would absorb to much heat during the hot days .And white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold .And dark grey is just in the middle so it does not get to hot or to cold .
27822	10	2	2	black :: The color black will make the doghouse warmer . This is becuase in the experiment the average temperature for the Black Lid was 53 ( DEG ) C compared to the White Lid at the average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that the darker the color the warmer the object/doghouse will be because it obsorbs more heat .
27824	10	2	2	light gray :: If the doghouse were to be light gray , the air temperature wouldn't be too low , but not too high . The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8 ( DEG ) while the difference between light gray and white is 3 ( DEG ) . This way , light gray would be perfect as an in-between .
27826	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because it doesn't attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does . Inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter . In the summer it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black . Another reason why I chose light was it had an average temp of 45 ( DEG ) c warmer than whites average temp of 42 ( DEG ) c .
27827	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be the coldest for the dog .
27831	10	2	2	white :: the best color would be white because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors
27836	10	2	2	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse because darker colors absorb more light energy . So light grey would absorb some but not alot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot ( 45 ( DEG ) )
27838	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose Dark Gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would , but it still is a dark color to absorb some light . This would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because it won't be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse . Comparing my choice to the expirement When they used Black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature . Dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , but I thought 45 ( DEG ) C for the light gray would be to cold .
27839	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white would affect it because in the summer , the doghouse would be cooler . In the experiment , the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the pthers were much higher .
27840	10	2	2	white :: I chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of Brandi and Jerry's experiment results . In the experiment , when they tested the lid color black , the average temperature inside the jar was 53 ( DEG ) C . This was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29 ( DEG ) . Meanwhile , the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C , therefore having the lowest temperature aver age . This time , the temperature raised only 18 ( DEG ) after ten minutes . Compared to the black lid , the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11 ( DEG ) less . Ultimately , I chose to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest . White had the lowest average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C and would keep any dog nice and cool .
27842	10	2	2	white :: Black: Average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) Dark Gray: Average temperature was 48 ( DEG ) Light Gray: Average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) White: Average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) Because of the cool temperatures , I would choose white as the doghouse color . With black , the doghouse would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog .
27843	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color to have for dog house because it's temperature would keep the dog house the coolest . In the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C , so that was the best choice and the worst choice was black . The black colored jar had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , so that was the worst choice because it could be to hot for the dog .
27848	10	2	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse because the darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside . For example when tested the blakc got 53 ( DEG ) c , the dark gray got 48 ( DEG ) c , the light gray got 45 ( DEG ) c , and the white got 42 ( DEG ) c . you see as the color increases from darkto light , the temp ature decreases .
27849	10	2	2	white :: I would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because , it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot . The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board . While there was a black lid on ajar the average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) C When there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . That is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the two lids . SO if you want the doghouse to be colder for the dog you'd want to get a white doghouse .
27850	10	2	2	black :: Black , because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for ther dog house .
27852	10	2	2	black :: If they were to use a black paint it would de finetely increase the dog houses air tempature . Accordinq to the data the color black had an average of 52 ( DEG ) c . after ten minutes of the experiment , unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures .
27853	10	2	2	white :: The data table shows that the white lid jar took in the least heat . The black lid jar took in an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes under the lamp . The white lid jar only took in an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out .
27854	10	2	2	dark gray :: If the doghouse were dark gray , it might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse . Heat is attracted to darker objects , so it would be warmer , but not as warm as it would be black . The data from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53 ( DEG ) C , the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the white was 42 ( DEG ) C .
27856	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when it's sunny outside . I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes , but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes . So , if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler .
27858	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs . In their test Brandi and Jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest
27859	10	2	2	white :: The white color paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it isn't as dark . From the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperature .
27862	10	2	2	white :: Having white would make the inside temp . cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27867	10	2	2	white :: it would affect the doghoused because white is cooler than the dark colors . the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53 .
27869	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm . The color black reflects heat . In the experiment black had the highest average temperture of 53 ( DEG ) over all the other tested colors .
27874	10	2	2	white :: I would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog . In the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog .
27876	10	2	2	white :: it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it . it showed it was 42 ( DEG ) and thats cooler than all the other colors
27883	10	2	2	black :: The color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color , the greater the increase in air temperature . In the results of the hot lamp experiment , the blacks air temperature got the highest average with 53 ( DEG ) C .This is because dark co lors absorb more energy .
27887	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cooler inside because its the lightest ( brightest ) color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black ( darkest color ) was 53 degrees C and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees C . Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house .
27888	10	2	2	black :: By painting the doghouse black , Brandi and Jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse . The data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment .
27890	10	2	2	light gray :: This way the inside of the doghouse won't be too hot or too cold . The average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) . White would be too cold because the average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) . Black would be too hot because the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) .
27894	10	2	2	white :: I think that the best paint color for the dog house is White . I picked this color because white doesnt affect the inside of the house with a lot of heat . So it would stay cool during the summer time for a dog . Because if you paint it balck , sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hott sun going in the dog house .
27895	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose Light Gray because if you put black it might be too hot because the trials where the avergae was 53 ( DEG ) c . For dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average was 48 ( DEG ) c . Light gray was 45 ( DEG ) c and that just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot . White may be to cold at 42 ( DEG ) c .
27896	10	2	2	white :: White's ( color of paint ) affect on the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up . So in the summer , the dog will be able to stay cooler , longer . I know this because in the experiment , the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2 ( DEG ) C each trial .
27897	10	2	2	black :: i chose black becuase that means the dog house would be warmer on the inside , i know that because the average temperature of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees .
27898	10	2	2	white :: Having a white doghouse would keep the inside mof the doghouse cooler . The average tempature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) , while the inside of the jar with the black lid was an average of 53 ( DEG ) . The dog house would be on average 11 ( DEG ) cooler .
27901	10	2	2	white :: The color that would be best for the doghouse in the SUMMER would be white . In the experiment with the effects of color on temperature , the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature , rising from 24 ( DEG ) C to an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . But the white lid caused the least increase in temperature , rising from 24 ( DEG ) C to only 42 ( DEG ) C . So if Brandi and Jerry want to keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer , they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white , as it provides the least increase in temperature .
27902	10	2	2	white :: A white dog house would make it cooler inside . From the data the average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) C which was cooler then the other colors .
27903	10	2	2	white :: it will effect the dog house by absorbing less heat energy keeping the dog house cool , evidence frome the table states the average temp . for white is 42 celsius .
27905	10	2	2	white :: The color white will reflect more of the sunlight . Wich will make the house a colder temperature .White was the coldest temperature in the expirement .Its average was 42 ( DEG ) wich was the lowest temperature and black had the highest temperature wich was 53 ( DEG ) as an average .
27909	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light gray . Light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold . In the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45 ( DEG ) C . The black lid let in an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . The least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . If i chose the white lid , the dog might be too cold inside his house . With black paint , the dog could be too hot inside his house .
27910	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color for a doghouse might be Light gray because it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldn't be to hot . In the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) c and the others were 53 , 48 , and 42 ( DEG ) c
27913	10	2	2	light gray :: This color was the in between color , or middle color . It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance , so for trial 1 it was 44 ( DEG ) c for trial 2 it was 45 ( DEG ) c , for 3 it was 46 ( DEG ) C and for trial 4 it was back to 45 ( DEG ) C . This is the best color , since it will keep the dog warm , but not too warm and not to cold either .
27918	10	2	2	white :: white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy than light colors . With white paint inside the dog house it's going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house it's going to be hot . In the experiment dark color lids attraked more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids thats why white color paint will be abetter color for the dog house so it stays cooler .
27936	10	2	2	white :: A white painted doghouse would make the internal temperture cooler because as the experiment has shown , the average internal air temperture of the jar with a white lid was 42 ( DEG ) , while the other lids caused average tempertures ranging from 45 ( DEG ) - 53 ( DEG ) .
27937	10	2	2	black :: Painting a doghouse black would help heat the house . From the experiment , black made the air temperature rise the most .
27941	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the doghouse cooler so the dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun . According to the experiment the white-colored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids . It was 42 ( DEG ) in the white lid for trial one and 54 ( DEG ) for the black lid on trial one .
27946	10	2	2	white :: this color wouldnt make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster , the black heated up to 53 ( DEG ) and the white only heated up to 42 ( DEG )
27947	10	2	2	"""light gray :: The color light gray might affect the doghouse by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse . This also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog . Since , in Brandi &amp; Jerri's investigation , after being placed under a lamp for 1 0 minutes , the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 degrees celcius . While the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were: White-42 , Dark Gray-48 , &amp; Black-53 .So , alight gray doghouse would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse , In which I would assume to be a more comforatable temperature ."""
27948	10	2	2	light gray :: I think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot and not too cold . According to the lid experiment light grey had averaging tempertures of 44-46 compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average of 41-43 . The averages for the light grey lid are moderately cool which would be a good choice for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze .
27950	10	2	2	black :: brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most . accordding to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because black got an average of 53 ( DEG ) and white got an average of 42 ( DEG ) . so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside .
27952	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house cooler . The average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color , grey , at 45 ( DEG ) C
27955	10	2	2	white :: If you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer days . White would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the Air- Temperature experiment , the color black ( the darkest lid ) had the highest avg . temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 C . the lightest color of lid ( white ) had the lowest avg . temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 C . The difference between the dark lid ( black ) and the light lid ( white ) was 11 C . So therefore the lighter the color in this case white , will attract the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature .
27957	10	2	2	light gray :: The white may be best because it is the colle st color ( tempurature ) as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house .
27960	10	2	2	white :: White will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attract more heat .
27961	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house . The color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black . I know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53 ( DEG ) C and the average temperature for dark grey is 48 ( DEG ) C
27962	10	2	2	black :: black might effect the dog house because in the chart black has the highest temperature of all colors
27963	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the white lid was an average of 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid .
27968	10	2	2	black :: It will keep the house warmer in the winter . The balck lid had a average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the Dark gray had the average of 48 ( DEG ) C . The Light gray had an average of 45 ( DEG ) and the white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefor , the black colored roof is the best .
27969	10	2	2	black :: Black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer ( higher temperature ) because it absorbs more light energy . In the results , the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C while with the white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C , showing that black resulted in the highest temperature ( was the warmest ) .
27974	10	2	2	white :: If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house white , it would keep it cooler . When they did the lid experment , the average for the darker lid was highest ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) . If they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker . The average for the white paint was 42 ( DEG ) C so it proves that painting the dog sea lighter color will keep it cooler .
27976	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint . The average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the black paint was 11 ( DEG ) C warmer than the jar with the white lid .
27978	10	2	2	white :: They should use the color white because the color white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it cooler inside of the dog house , the results show that in all the trials white was in the low 40's , and all the other colors like light grey and black were in the high 40's and low 50's . Therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint .
27980	10	2	2	white :: I think white because the inside will be cool eras shown in the experiment . The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment was 43 ( DEG ) where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 ( DEG ) , which proves the white is cooler .
27981	10	2	2	white :: I choose white , this mite affect the dog house by making cooler in hot weather . I choose this because in the experiment white had the coolest temperature
27982	10	2	2	white :: If Brandi and Jerry pianted the dog house white , then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 40-45 ( DEG ) C because the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house .
27984	10	2	2	black :: the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be beacuse dark colors obsorbe more light then other colors
27985	10	2	2	white :: this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracks less heat . i know this because the average temperature for black was 53 ( DEG ) , for dark gray it was 48 ( DEG ) , for light gray it was 45 ( DEG ) and for white it was 42 ( DEG ) therefore white attracks less heat
27988	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse black . This is because black absorbs more energy , causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler . From the experiment , when a black lid was used , the tempature inside the glass jar was 48 ( DEG ) C but when a white lid was used , the tempature inside the glass jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . So as you can see the lighter the color of the lid , the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid , the warmer the tempature inside the glass jar will be .
27994	10	2	2	white :: They should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42 ( DEG ) c and it was the lighest color . If they chose black the dog house would be too hot . i know this because black has the highest temerature average ( 53 ( DEG ) c ) .
27995	10	2	2	white :: Because hot and the black made the jar 53 .25 ( DEG ) ( on average ) while the white only made it 42 ( DEG ) on average . Making white the better choice .
27998	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best paint color for the doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool . White averaged at 42 ( DEG ) C after 10minutes while black was 53 ( DEG ) C , proving that the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler .
27999	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color if Brandi and Jerry lived in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than any other color . According to thier experiment the black lid had the highest temperature .
28000	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warm . Black was 11 ( DEG ) , 8 ( DEG ) , and 5 ( DEG ) more than the white , light gray , and dark gray paints .
28013	10	2	2	white :: Since dogs have fur , they dont need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color . the black color was 53 ( DEG ) c and the white was 42 ( DEG ) c making the white coloe less likely to become hot
28014	10	2	2	black :: in the data table it shows the black paint will keep the doghouse the warmest because , black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray , light gray or white paint
28017	10	2	2	white :: white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the doghouse will stay cool . in the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C when the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C . Also out of the 4 colores the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest
28018	10	2	2	black :: black would obsorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54 ( DEG ) c compared to the color white wich was 42 ( DEG ) c the temperature was a big jump from black and white .
28019	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the dog cooler because it was the least warmest in the jar .
28021	10	2	2	white :: having white paint would make the dog house colder so in the summer the dog would not be hot . The average for white is the coolest tempature ( 42 ( DEG ) )
28022	10	2	2	light gray :: I think that light gray is a good color because when it's sunny and hot outside , the darker colors will make the doghouse very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog . I didn't choose white because although it's not a huge difference , light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot .
28023	10	2	2	light gray :: the inside wont be hot and it wont be very cold either . the light gray average temperature had an average of 45 ( DEG ) C unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
28025	10	2	2	black :: based on the results in the experiment if they painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog the warmest .
28028	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and jerry should paint the the doghouse the color white . This color will affect the inside of the doghouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color becaue light colors absorb less energy . Evidence from Brandi and Jerry's Hot lamp experiment showed that the darker the color of the lid , the warmer the air inside the jar was . So if they plan to have a living animal inside ( in this case a dog ) I think it'd be more comfortable if the doghouse wasn't hot , they should paint the dog house white .
28030	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse black because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54 ( DEG ) , trial two 52 ( DEG ) , trial three 54 ( DEG ) , and the adv erage they got was 53 ( DEG ) . So they should paint the doghouse black because it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black .
28032	10	2	2	white :: If you design a white doghouse the chances are that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black , dark gray , light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absorb . See beacause when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of it's drak color , and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it's lighter color .
28033	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside . I know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature . The average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C which is higher than the dark gray ( 48 ( DEG ) C ) , the light gray ( 45 ( DEG ) C ) , and the white ( 42 ( DEG ) C )
28035	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white .
28036	10	2	2	black :: useing the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs . Air tempature inside glass jar . the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42 ( DEG ) s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint .
28038	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the doghouse would be white . In the experiment white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C wich wus the lowest temperature out of the four colors . White would keep the doghouse cool .
28040	10	2	2	black :: Black would probubly affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat . Plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat .
28041	10	2	2	white :: white is the best color because in the expera ment the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture .
28042	10	2	2	white :: If they paint the doghouse white then the tem peratrure inside will be alot cooloer becuase the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) cooler than the jar with the black lid . Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog nice and cool
28043	10	2	2	black :: it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm , because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more . and in the investigation the average for black was 53 , the highest out of the rest , so thats my prove that it would make it warmer/hot .
28046	10	2	2	dark gray :: The inside of the dog house would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48 ( DEG ) c , Black would make it hot at 50 ( DEG ) c , light gray would make it cool at 45 ( DEG ) c , and white would keep it cold at 42 ( DEG ) c .
28048	10	2	2	dark gray :: If the color is dark grey for the doghouse than it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons . In the investigation Hot Lamp , the lid color that increased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C , however the second highest was the dark grey lid with an average of 48 ( DEG ) C . So , the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house , to keep the dog at a comfortable temper ture .
28051	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the best color for the doghouse is black . This color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing its temprature , therefore , the dog can stay warm . I know this is true because the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees , while the average temprature with white , for example , was 42 degrees . Clearly , black would be the best color for the doghouse .
28054	10	2	2	white :: White is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp , the white lid was the coolest with an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) c . The black lid was 53 ( DEG ) c , the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) c , and the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) c . If they use black as the doghouse colour then the dog might get to hot if he/she stays in there to long . If they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up . If they use light gray for the colour of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating . If they use white as the dog house colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before he/she over heats .
28061	10	2	2	black :: the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be . In the experiment hot lamp , the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the jar . when the lid was black the tempature was at 53 ( DEG ) ( C ) and when the white lid was on the tempature decreased to 42 ( DEG ) ( C ) .
28062	10	2	2	white :: white because the white gets less heat than the other colors . black got an average of 53 ( DEG ) c . the dark gray got an average of 48 ( DEG ) c . and light gray got an average of 45 ( DEG ) c . but the white got an average of 42 ( DEG ) c . so it should be white .
28065	10	2	2	black :: A black dog house will hold heat better than anyother color .I know this because in the lid experiment black's air temp ature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white .
28068	10	2	2	white :: White would effect the inside of the dog house because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black , dark gray , or light gray . The average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C while the average for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . That is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) . Although the dark gray lid and the light gray lid didn't have such an extreme difference from the white lid , the dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24 ( DEG ) C . Also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the glass container 29 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature on average . That is a difference of agian 11 ( DEG ) C .
28070	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the color because according to the experiment , white had the lowest temperature so the dogs wouldn't get to hot .
28078	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data white will make the dog house cooler . Light colors don't absorb as much heat as dark colors . In conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather .
28079	10	2	2	black :: Acorrding the expirement , the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher , therefore making a black-painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors .
28080	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray is the best color for a doghouse because a black dog house is too hot for the dog , being 53 ( DEG ) C on average . The white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42 ( DEG ) C inside . The only options left are dark gray and light gray , but with the heat coming off from the dog itself , more heat will circulate around the doghouse . Therefore , light gray , with 45 ( DEG ) C on average , would be abetter color to paint a doghouse than dark gray , with 48 ( DEG ) C on average .
28082	10	2	2	white :: they should use white because the average temperature of white was 42 ( DEG ) C , and the average temp of black was 53 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , the color white would keep the dog coolest .
28083	10	2	2	dark gray :: A dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun . In the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid didn't have the hottest or the coldest air inside .
28090	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside . The average for white is 42 ( DEG ) instead of black being 53 ( DEG ) .
28098	10	2	2	white :: the white paint would make the doghouse cooler .the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celicus . the white paint would be 42degrees celcius .
28103	10	2	2	white :: The dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest ( coldest ) . Since dogs like the shade and cold to cool them down in the summer , white would reflect the most light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot . After ten minutes , the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees C on average . However , the jar with the white lid didn't heat up at all on average .
28107	10	2	2	white :: I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial , 54 ( DEG ) C , then for the last trial also 54 ( DEG ) C . Where as White at its first trial got 42 ( DEG ) C and 41 ( DEG ) C for its last trial
28108	10	2	2	light gray :: Since the doghouse will have a living being in it , the temperature should be comfortable for the dog . 53 ( DEG ) C is very , very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable , especially on a warm summer day . But , 41 ( DEG ) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time , as this would be a year-round house for the dog . So , 45 ( DEG ) C would be less hot in the summer , and more warm in the winter , which is just perfect for the dog .
28110	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temperature than any of the other colors will , thus preventing the dog from over heating . This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes , ajar wit ha white lid had an increased temperature of 18 ( DEG ) C , while jars with darker lids ( ranging from light gray to black ) had an increase in temperature of anywhere from 21 ( DEG ) C to 29 ( DEG ) C . The white lid kept the jar cooler , so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well . This is healthier for the dog .
28116	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out . From the experiment , the white lid was the coolest out of all four lids .
28118	10	2	2	white :: White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black . White had a average of 42 ( DEG ) c and black was 53 ( DEG ) c .
28119	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because , since black absorbs the most energy and the inside would have been hot . Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed . Light Gray would have been a perfect color , not only absorbing the perfect amount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors Black and Dark Grey .
28120	10	2	2	light gray :: As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted , we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Knowing this , we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated , so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available . Which in this case , is white . Though , the dog , being alive creature shouldn't get too cold , therefore , light gray is the perfect compromise . Keeping the dog warm enough , but not too hot .
28123	10	2	2	white :: Durring the experiment , Brandi and Jerry found out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it . If the white color was painted apon the top of the dog house , then the temperature wouldnt rise as much as the black coored paint because , jerry and Brandi made there experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar . For example , on Trial 1 , the white container had an air temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54 ( DEG ) c .
28127	10	2	2	white :: it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40 ( DEG ) C . light gray was in high mid 40 ( DEG ) C , dark gray in high 40 ( DEG ) C , and black was in low 50 ( DEG ) C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature cooler
28128	10	2	2	light gray :: I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat . So that means lighter colors help reflect . Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a little , and in the some helps reflect a good amount .
28129	10	2	2	black :: they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed . The black lid was an average of 5 ( DEG ) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house
