8552	4	2	2	The word invasive is particularly important to the article because it describes foreign reptiles in America. Many reptiles such as snakes and lizards have invaded America.

Invasive species are nonnative species that are introduced to an environment and will eat  indigenous species. Because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie.

8698	4	2	2	"""In this article the word """"invasive"""" means that something is coming into an ecosystem and dominating it by using its resources.

8771	4	2	2	The word invasive is important to the article because it helps show how reptiles that are not typically found in the us are being brought here and are causing endangerment to US native species like the wood rat. Pythons would not be normally found in the Everglades and are invading the US and killing off our animals typically found here.
8794	4	2	2	"""The word """"invasive"""" is significant to this article because it shows one perspective on the role of imported species.

8896	4	2	2	The word invasive means that a species was brought into an area, not by means of being a native species.

Invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity. The article deals whether or not this is true of this case.
8915	4	2	2	The word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals. The term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there.

9046	4	2	2	In the story by invasive species they mean species that go into a new land and change how things naturally were and do things such as kill the endangered animals of the area. In the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator. That's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment.
9061	4	2	2	The significance of the word invasive in the article is used to show how these reptiles can be considered pets to some, and others consider it as an annoyance in some sort.

The word """"invasive"""" helps to provide debate on this article."""
9107	4	2	2	An invasive species is a non-native species that is introduced into an environment. These non-native species are dangerous because they often have no natural predators in the new environment and they flourish. Earth is not used to the rapid change humans have brought that lives complicated an environments niche. Humans have animals as pets, a large and potray source. These pets however are sometimes dangerous. There is a disagreement between the pandas and the biologists.
9197	4	2	2	The word ''invasive'' in the article is reffering to certain species that are disrupting the ecosystem. For example, in 1 rest of the article at is said that pythons are very invasive because they are ''imperiling five endangered species.'' Invasive in the the article means that any species controling the habitat + endangering other animals is considered invasive.

The second way is that it is seen us an unfair term for these snakes and should be substituted for """"introduced as """"invasive"""" is known as a passing judgement."""
9249	4	2	2	The significance of the word invasive in the article is that it describes a dangerous situation that is occuring in the US. An invasive species is one that is introduced into a foreign environment, and if allowed to remain, can cause much harm to environments and native species. One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US.
9270	4	2	2	"""These invasive species are considered invasive because they weren't supposed to originally be here. This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem.

9285	4	2	2	The word invaisive is significant to this article. This article talks about how pythons & other generalized species can live in countries with the same climate as their homeland. But, when these animals move to a new country they invade the enviorment of the animals that are living there. Many bad events can occur because the ecosystem in that area is disrupted by the invaision of the new organism.

Pythons are a dangerous invasive species, especially in Florida, because they """"are imperiling five endangered species in the Florida Keys""""."""
9698	4	2	2	The word invasive is significant because it explains briefly what will happen when the species alters an unknown habitat. When an invasive species is introduced to an environment, it will complete to an indigenrous species food source. If this happens, the competition may leave the native species endangered or even intimet. When it is survival of the fittest, those without competition have an advantage over those who compete with invasive species.
9711	4	2	2	"""Invasive is a very significant word in this article. It is used by many biologists to describe pythons as it denotes that they are unwelcome in Florida due to the fact the fact that they aren't native there and they pose a threat to other species.

9790	4	2	2	Invasive means that a species, not native to the particular area it was introduced to; overpopulares and causes extinction to other species. This is relative to the article because the article talks about how pythons are becoming an invasive species in Florida and even endangered the key Largo wood rat.
9794	4	2	2	The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem. Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an  unfamiliar environment. This is a problem as they are not the target of predators and they have many animals to prey on, causing populations to be shiffed. As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species.
9800	4	2	2	The term invasive means or species of plants or animals that is introduced to or new environment, that thrive and take over. The invasive species invade and aren't imbalance in ecosystems. In the article, invasive is being used to describe the pythons because they are not native to North America, yet they are continuing to multiply and are growing.
