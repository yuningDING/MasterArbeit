Then he tells us about 'Crash Course' That is about how large objects or satellites may crash into each other. 'Little bits, but a Big Deal' is informing us about those articles combined kind of. It talks about space debree, and how to solve the problem. It kind of wraps things up.
22972	9	2	2	First, the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage 'What Is Space Junk'. Here, they explain that when satellites malfunction, they become high-tech junk. In the next article 'Crash Course', the author tells a story of a U.S. and Russian satellites colliding, creating many debris. Finally, the author explains the importance and dangers of space junk in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.

22980	9	2	2	The author organizes the articles by producing several different titles and layering supporting evidence with facts. The introduction uses humor to convey the topic. 'What is Space Junk' gives a background as to how the the objects have muddled their way into the atmosphere. 'Crash Course' gives a more in-depth look at exactly what objects have been found and what dangerous effects they can have. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' expands on the need for a solution to the increasing amount of damage that has occured. The author uses a structure of history, cause, effect, and solution to reveal information.
22981	9	2	2	The author starts off trying to lure the reader asking a question. then using the title 'Crash Course' it is a good topic that we would like to find out what is going on; then ends it out with 'Little Bits,But a Big Deal' saying that it is a little thing or topic but itis a very big deal in the world.

The author of the article then told the reader about the dangers of space junk and how they affect all things in space in 'Crash Couse'.  Finally in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells of more problems that space trash causes and tells one how the problem is increasing and how it is trying to be stopped, 'Space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.'  This makes for a well rounded article.
22986	9	2	2	The aurthor organize that article by putting different information in its own subject so that the reader can understand and lean about one thing at at time. By putting the articles in there owns subject like 'What Is Space Junk?. The reader can only read about what space junk is, and not have to read about crash cousre, cause thats in the next reading.
22987	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading. The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk?' to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about.

Finally, in the last section, the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk.
23044	9	2	2	The author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections. The first section explains the main purpose of the aticle. The second section explains how all of this space 'junk' has gotten there. The third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space. The final section explains the dangers of the space debris and how the space agencies are trying to solve the probelm, and prevent damage from space debris.
23051	9	2	2	He starts out by telling the concern of space junk, then moving on to what space junk is and what it's about. The author explains the dangers of space junk using examples and things that have actually happened to make the reader believe it. I understand the need to be concerned about this space junk, because it could cause a lot of problems with the Earth, astronauts, and space crafts.
23053	9	2	2	He first starts out with the introduction to be interesting, to get your attention. Then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk' can be.

23057	9	2	2	The author organizes in a good way, by using sections. the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space. One section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is. Another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk. Each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space.
23060	9	2	2	The author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way. Once the reader has been hooked in the author begins to describe how big of a problem space junk really is. After describing what space junk is the author talks about the dangers of the space junk and how big of a problem its becoming. Then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger. The auhor talks about how space travel is actually the cause and we need to put forth an effort to clean space pollution rather than adding to an already dangerous problem.
23061	9	2	2	The Space Junk title is starting of by saying there is actually Space Junk. In the next paragraph they are saying how the Space Junk even gets there. In the last one they are saying how the Space Junk can harm Space Shuttles and all different kinds of things.
23064	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least. They start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about.

23065	9	2	2	He splits the article up into five sections: introduction, what is space junk?, crash course, little bits but a big deal and a conclusion.     In his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2. In sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one. He does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk. Then, in the conclusion he wraps it up by saying he is sure this problem will continue especially with an increace in commercial space travel.
23070	9	2	2	The author starts by getting the reader 'excited'. Then they get let down because the 'comet' isn't a comet, it's a tool bag. The line 'It's a . . . tool bag?' directs that.      It starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually 'die'.So the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the 'Final Frontier'.
23073	9	2	2	In the introduction the author gives a scenario to attract the reader's attention where he/she then explains the scenario and it's significance in the article thus giving a topic sentence where in the following few paragraphs explains the origination and history of 'space junk' where the narrator then states the harmful effects of space junk and then explains why space junk is so harmful, and finally the conclusion states some ways that NASA and other space agencies are trying to solve this problem.
23074	9	2	2	First he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance. after the readers attention is caught, he explains the reasoning for his introduction. He then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head.

23081	9	2	2	The auther breaks up the article into subtopics.such as 'What is space junk?' and 'Crash Course'.
23083	9	2	2	The author organizes the article but using sub titles and paragraphs.  He doesn't lump together different ideas, he keeps ideas of the same nature within one se ction related subtitle.  He started with What Is Space junk, whick explains what he's talking about.  Crash Course, follows, talking about how even minor 'space junk' can be a huge threat.  Finally, in Little Bits, But a Big Deal, he further explains how even the smallest fragment of 'space junk' can cause massave damage to a space craft, and what steps scientists are doing to try to fix the problem.
23089	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a way that grabs your attention at the beginning. Then tells a little about the background information. Thirdly, the author transitions into talking about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, the author concludes with saying that all of this trash in space is a big deal and we need to do something about it.
23105	9	2	2	The author organizes his article by starting with an introduction which he uses to pull the reader in. Then he expands and reveals more information on his topic with an informative paragraph, titled 'What Is Space Junk?'.

He concludes his articles by stating that precautions are being made to help with the dangerous dilemma, while a complete solution is still underway.
23107	9	2	2	He seperates it into different sectoins such as What is Spacr junk? and Crash course.
23112	9	2	2	The author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text. The titles gives the reader a little information about what the next section will mainly be about, like 'Crash Course'. The reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding. The author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea. It helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area.
23115	9	2	2	The author starts out with a good, exciting introduction. He catches your attention, then gets serious. First he just expalins to you what space junk is and how it gets there.Then he starts talking about the collisions. As he goes on he talks about what happens with a collision. If its bad or not. Then he talks about how stuff like this is a big deal. Even if it is just a small thing floating around, it could cause alot of harm.
23116	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter. The the author broke the article down into sections. For example in the heading 'Crash Course' it talks about the history of satellites that have collided in the past.
23117	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by splitting it up and putting certain statistics in certain paragraphs so it keeps the reader entertained; wanting to know more. The author starts out the introduction with statements that catch the readers attention, then they talk about everything that has been made recently for observing space, then they talk about all of the collisions that have happened up in space, and then they end the article stating how little things can have a huge impact on earth.
23119	9	2	2	First, the author grabs the readers attention by making an awkward yet interesting opening statement, which is 'It's a . . . tool bag?' The next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be.      Then in the next section, the author gives the reader background information on space junk. That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk. That section connects well the Crash Couse section, which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space.     The final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future. So overall, the author goes from grabbing the readers attention,  to giving background information for understanding, to specific details and events, and then finally the effects and future effects space junk can have.
23120	9	2	2	The article is organized by the author into sections. Each section is seperate different subjects. For example, the section titled 'Crash Course' is explaining that when things break apart the debri stays in space and it can cause damage to other things simpily by just hitting it.
23122	9	2	2	The author organize's the article with different titles to represent what they are talking about. What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, ect.
23131	9	2	2	First, the author starts out with what the article is going to be about. Just like any other story should start out as. In the fourth and fifth paragraph he is telling information about what has been sent to Earths atmosphere. In the 'Crash Course' section, obviously he had put information on how the debris got in the way and satallites crashed into eachother. And in the very last section called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author talks about how debris is a serious problem to Earth and Space.
23146	9	2	2	The author organizes the article from the basics of space. First , knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space. Second, is what could happen when there is a crash in space and how dangerous it is when dead satellites could risk colliding. Third, how it is a big deal on what is in space and if it falls to the ground. In conclusion, The author is just making it easier to understand.
23155	9	2	2	The author organized the article in way to guide the reader along with the information. There is a lot of important information, so the author organizes it so that the audience can completely understand it. The author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk. The reader knows what will be in the next section because of the title, 'What Is Space Junk?' Then, the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is. The space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris. Finally, the author wraps up the article explaining why space junk possesses a harm to spacecrafts and other objects in space. The space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space.' The author builds information from the last section by putting more details into the next section to describe the effects of space junk more.
23157	9	2	2	The author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections. Each section gives information about what happens. The 'What is Space Junk?' section explains how space capsules, satellites, and teloscopes explore space. This section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the Earth. The 'Crash Course' section explains how the dead satellites orbit around the Earth and great speed and then crash into each other causing pieces from them to break off and sometimes go into Earth. The 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section explains how something no smaller than the size of a baseball can not be indentified on a radar, which makes it harder to a spacecraft to avoid those objects.
23170	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in to sections. There is an introductory paragraph to get the reader's attention, a section to explain the history of it all, 'What Is Space Junk?,' a section to talk about space collisions, 'Crash Course,' and a section to talk about how dangerous it can actually be even though space exploration is very important, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way. It really gets the point across.
23172	9	2	2	The author opens the article with a introduction to get the readers attention, and then he gives a third paragraph to keep the readers attention and tell them what's coming. After this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections, 'What Is Space Junk?' 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', these sections help seperate the articles, so the author doesn't have to try to transition from one thought to the next, but instead give us information and connect them again at the end of the article in the conclusion.
23173	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into different sections that fall under the appropriate headings. Things like satellite collisions are under Crash Course while the actual definition of space junk, which is a different topic, is under a different heading to make the article easier to read and understand.
23185	9	2	2	The author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order. The article starts off with the introduction, then to the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', to explain what the introduction was about.     The next section is 'Crash Course' because the last part of the previous section talked about satellites loosing control, and going into orbit. So 'Crash Course' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit.     After 'Crash Course', the next section is titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This is next because it talks about what can happen when two satellites crash into each other which was talked about in the last article.     The author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused.
23187	9	2	2	The author starts off by getting your attention the explaining what space junk is. Then they talk about how satellites can collide with each other. The author ends by explaining how space junk poses a big problem.
23196	9	2	2	The Article 'Orbiting Junk' is organized in a way that is most understandable to the reader.  The introduction grabs the readers' attention about the issue. Next, under 'What is Space Junk?' The auther defines the problem, giving an examples of space junk. After that, the auther explains hoe space junk occurs in 'Crash Course.' And finally, the author explains why this is a problem in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' in which the author provides examples to make a big idea like space seem more relatable.
23197	9	2	2	The author organized the article with a persausive, informative feel that also has a introduction, body, and conclusion.  The introduction is very attractive.  In paragraph one, the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things.  On top of that, the author also asked a rhetoric question in paragraph two with a bit of humor mixed in.  The body of this article has a more serious tone by providing facts and history about satellites and how they become space junk.  In paragraph four, sentance one, the author explains how 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the the first artificial satellite.'  The conclusion of this article is paragraph 11, where the author clearly restates his point of writing the article.  In sentance one and two of paragraph 11, the author proclaims, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing becaus e commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.'
23202	9	2	2	The author organizes the article very well. He starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the reader's attention. He then tells us what space junk is, as well as provides us with reasons why sending objects into space. We send capsules, telescopes, and satellites into space because they do so much for us; they monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless communcation possible.               In the next paragraph we read about crash courses. Having read the article before it, we know why this can be a terrible occurence. The following paragraph, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', gives us more evidence that space debris can be a very serious problem. So at the end of reading the article we've been informed in a good order about 'Orbiting Junk'.
23203	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by first using an interesting interduction to hook the audience, then they broke the remaining paragraphs into catagories in order to make the article easier to follow and understand. The catagories the author used were 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Cource', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
23206	9	2	2	The author organizes it into three different sections. The first section tells us about the space invasion and about general space junk. The second section is about two satellites colliding wih one another, causing microdebris. The third section is about the people caring about microdebris and the increase in more of it because of other countries joining the race to space.
23210	9	2	2	He seperated it into three diffrent sections so you knew what you were reading about. What is space junk?, Crash course., and Little bits, but a big deal.
23217	9	2	2	The author organized the article with an inroduction and a body. They start out my just explaining what they are going to talk about. They move on to what really is 'space junk'. Thhe author gives us information on the topic and little history behind it. Then they start to bring out facts and statistics. Next, they talk about the damage space junk can do. They give more facts and number that we cannot ignore. Finally, they tell us that this is serious matter and we have to face it. The author tells us that the space junk numbers has gone up and it is damaging our orbital system around Earth. They also conclude that the space junk is making space missions more dangerous.
23220	9	2	2	The author beings the article with an attention graber to introduce what the rest of the article will include. He then use the next sectoin, 'What Is Space Junk?' to define and descibe the problem at hand. Next in the section 'Crash Course'  the author explains that 'dead satellites run the risk of collidin with each other,' which is becoming a major issue.  'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is used to emphasis  on the idea that this is indeed a serious problem that needs to be fixed. He concludes in stating that 'space trash is actually increasing' and that we most 'work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.'
23223	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by presenting different topics about how space junk is created, and how it can be harmful.  Each section presents a different problem contributing to the build up of space junk.  The author starts out by grabbing the reader with some shocking statements, and then explains the topic of the article.  The author then continues on to explain what space junk is, and how it is building up in outerspace.  After, the author shows how satellites collide, causing them to break into smaller pieces, which leads into the last section about how harmful the tiny pieces can really be.
23225	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a way that it starts out introducing and explaining what space junk is and gives facts and other things that talk about what happens and how space crafts and such become space junk. Then the article continues explaining the happenings and the consequences of these happenings by giving statistics and other facts in the section 'Crash Course'. After establishing what space junk is and how it is hazardous.The author tells how much of impact that all of this space junk can have and how it continues to increase today.

After the introduction, the author spent his or her time informing the reader about what 'space junk' really is. Next, the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother. Finally, the last paragraphs were to show the reader how important 'space junk' is and how much NASA and other space exploring organizations are concerned with it.
23258	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration. The author puts 'What is Space Junk?' first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere. The puts 'Crash Course' this is letting us know that the space junk is now orbitting around the earth at intense speeds. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the Earth.
23261	9	2	2	The author organized the article in a unique way. Firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment. then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk'. Then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes. After that how little bits can make a big deal later on. Finally ending with a conclusion.
23262	9	2	2	In the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space. In the second section the author tells about how free-orbiting satellites can crash into each other, causing small satellites to be formed.

After this they tell you about how two satellites crashed into one another causing space debris. After that, they talk about the damage that could be done by the debris and how it can break down other ships and satellites in space. With all that information, they talk about how this problem will worsen and cause more crashes and more debris in the future.
23427	9	2	2	The author starts with the importance of space junk when this person says 'This 'space junk' is currently of great concern to the government space agencies around the globe.' The author proceeds to tell what space junk really is when it says 'What happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions and can't be repaired? The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.' Then the author tells about what will eventually happen to these satellites while they are going about in space in the crash course paragraph, by saying 'two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 mile per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.' Then the author tells about how these small pieces of debris could cause alot of damage to those traveling in space.

For example he has an introduction and three sections which names are: 'what Is Space Junk' 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
23457	9	2	2	The author organizes his articles into sections.  Every article has a differnet subtitle that  explains a differnet subject.  One example of the would be 'what is space junk'.  Each article is different making the reader able to understand it easier.
23462	9	2	2	The author organizes this article because each section provides different details to different aspects of spance junk.  The section 'What Is Space Junk?' explains what space junk is where 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' shows that small objects traveling at high speeds can cause a big problem like navigating a space craft through a microdebris field that could harm the space craft.  The sections also make the article easier to navigate and read.
23466	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into sections. The author has three sections in his article. Each have atleast two paragraph. Both listing what topic they are writting about. The three sections are called 'What is space junk', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'
23470	9	2	2	The author organizes the article first by telling us what is a space junk and what they are , satellites in the atmosphere orbiting with out control. Then Crash Course which is about dead satellites craching. Then Little Bits, But a Big Deal, this little topic is about people that are concern of the little bits of space debris that can present a very serious problem.
23475	9	2	2	How does the author title the article, he titles is to help the reader. The first paragraph explains to the reader what space junk is, the second paragraph tells how the space junk, explained in the privious paragraph, can be of a affect on sattelites. The third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests. If the author would not have explained what space junk was then the reader might be lost in the second and third paragraph, same goes with if he had not explained how alot of the debre got there then the reader might have been lost in the third paragraph. so the way he titled it by explaining what space junk was then explaing how it got so clutter and how it can have an affect was the way the aothur organised this article.
23477	9	2	2	The author uses 'cause and effect' to organize the article. The author grabs your attention in the introduction.

23521	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in four sections. First, he starts with the introduction. His introduction catches the reader's eye, and provokes him to want to continue reading. Then, he defines what he is going to talk about; space junk. After that, he talks about the dangers of space junk through facts, stories, and examples about satellite crashes and space junk debris. Finally, the author concludes his article in a way which leaves the reader wanting to do something to stop the production of space junk.
23525	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving background knowledge, then conveying the problem, and finally, giving a call to action for a solution to the problem.      In the first piece of the article, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author gives a bit of information on what he/she is about to be talking about.  The author gives the background information that the reader needs, such as 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other, and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful.     Finally, the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem.  He/she conveys to the reader that, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' and that scientists need to come up for a solution to this problem before it becomes too large to handle.
23526	9	2	2	The author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader's attention.  The rhetorical questions are the talk about space junk will hold the reader's attention and ensure they stick around for more.  They then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is.  This gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article.  After that, they start with statistics that shock the reader.  That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph.  The last few paragraphs show the impact the space junk causes, the efforts of NASA, and the fact that space junk is increasing.  This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph.
23527	9	2	2	The way the article was organized by the authur is that; first about orbiting junk, which is objects in free orbit in space. Then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is. Next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another. Then finally to little bits, but a big deal which talks about even tho the parts in fre orbit are small but they cause a big problem if they hit anything.
23532	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal'.  The author captures the readers interist through the introduction by using a shocking statement and making readers think, why is there a tool bag in the sky?  After this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section 'What is Space Junk?'.  Then in the section 'Crash Course' the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision.  After this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.'  Finally the author concludes that the problem is certain to persist and that the amout of space trash keeps increasing and then the author ends the article by saying that space agencies hope that corporations can come together to find a solution to the problem of space junk.
23536	9	2	2	The author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs. The paragraph titled 'What is Space Junk?', consists of information about what 'Space Junk' actually is. The author also lists details of conflicts with satellites, and crashes that have occured in the past.

Then the author has 'Crash Course' another main topic and finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and his conclusion. He makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important.
23547	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with facts of 'space junk' that are in space due to space exploration. The author then goes on to giving examples of what 'space junk' is and where it can come from. The autor gives the example of a two satellites crashing into each other, which created hundreds of pieces of debris. The author then goes on about the difficulty for a spacecraft to be in space and stay clear of the debris left by other spacecrafts and satellites. Lastly, the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article. The main idea is that the 'space junk' in space is increasing and still a problem for space agencies.
23559	9	2	2	The author seperates this article into 4 sections.  The first section is the introduction, where the author provides a brief explanation of space junk.  In the introduction, the author states that space junk is a great concern to government space agencies.  The next section is 'What is Space Junk?'.  This section informs the reader on how the debris gets into space and what exactly space junk is.     The next section is titled 'Crash Course'.  This section provides the reader with examples of satellites or debris crashing into each other at great speed.  The text describes a satellite crash that occured in February 2009.  Finally, the last section is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  This section informs the reader that space junk is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.
23566	9	2	2	The author organizes this artcile by first grabbing attention. The author then goes on and explains what space junk is then how it is dangerous. The author concludes that it scientist are trying to find a easy soultion and explains that it is an increasing problem.
23567	9	2	2	In the introduction it catctes the readers atention by using shocking statements. Then it  provides a history of space exploration. Next it talks about satellites and how they run the risk of colliding with each oter. Finally it explains that tiny bits of space trash is not a big deal.
23574	9	2	2	The article is organized with a title and sub-headings that emphasize the main points. What is Space Junk? explains space exploration and how man-made objects are in space orbit. Crash Course explains how an American and Russian satellite crashed, resulting in small pieces of debris. Little Bits, but a Big Deal explains that objects in free-orbit is an important matter. This set-up provides background information for the readers to clarify the theme.
23577	9	2	2	The author starts off with getting your attention. The author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite. The author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris. This debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous. The author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise.
23586	9	2	2	The author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite. They then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space. Start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk. They end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris. The small little things that float around can damage entire space stations.
23588	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them. For example, under the heading titled 'What Is Space Junk' there are examples of what space junk is and how it gets there. Under the heading 'Crash Course' there are examples of how objects in space without control run the risk of colliding and causing a lot of damage to both objects, and creating more space junk. The author then closes the article with a good conclusion.
23594	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving different sections are the article titles. By doing this they are letting you know specific information about space junk. For example in the section titled as 'Crash Course' the author shares information about the collison of two satellites going 20,000 miles per hour.
23596	9	2	2	The author separates the article into four sections.  the first section is the introduction.  In it, the author explains how 'space junk' is concerning government agencies all around the world.  The second section is titled, 'What Is Space Junk?'  In this section, the author gives background information about where space junk comes from.  The third section is titled, 'Crash Course'.  In this section, the author gives major events about space junk and what creates space junk.  The fourth section is titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  in this section, the author gives information about how the tiniest bit of space junk can damage a space shuttle.
23597	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with shocking statements and then explaining what space junk is.  The author then shows an example of two satellites crashing into each other, and an example of microdebris.  The author also tells us that even the smallest debris can destroy a spacecraft, and say that solutions are difficult.
23598	9	2	2	The article contains topics, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', to organizee the article.
23600	9	2	2	The author organizes the article according to topic. For example: in subsection What Is Space Junk?, the author explains exactly what is space junk. In the other two subsections, they are once again organized by topic. Crash Course talks about crashes of space junk and Little Bits, But a Big Deal talks about micro-debris.
23605	9	2	2	First the author states an interesting fact about space junk and then explains that it is a concern for astronauts. The author explains what space junk is and how it got up into space, then explains what impact the space junk could have on space stations and other technology up there. Lastly, the author expresses that even the smallest things up in space can pose a threat to man-made technology up in space. No matter how small the junk may be, it can still cause damage.
23609	9	2	2	The author organizes his article by putting a title over each section. He does this first by talking about the 'Orbiting Junk' and then by 'What is space Junk?' and so on and so fourth.
23610	9	2	2	First, the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers.  This tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information.  The author then uses a persuasive attention-getter to grab the reader's attention in the beginning, then goes off to tell what it is and where it came from.  Basically, it is a well organized informative essay.  You can tell that it is informative by the way it uses facts and true details to explain the situation.
23614	9	2	2	The author organizes the passage by an introduction into some of the common things that can be found in orbit around the planet. Then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites, starting with telling us about when the first one was launched.     Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage. The author refers to a gentle breeze blowing sand to using a sand blaster to remove paint off of a concrete wall to give us an accurate picture of what can happen.
23624	9	2	2	The author first starts out with a good attention getter to get you woundering what space junk is. Second they tell you what space junk is. Third they tell you what can happen with all the space junk. Fourthly the say why such a little thing can be a big problem.
23629	9	2	2	The author uses subtitles to organize the article.  Before certain paragraphs, at the left-hand side is a bolded subtitle.  For example, before the author gets into defining 'space junk', there is a subtitle labeled 'What Is Space Junk?'  Also, before the author tells about the microdebris in space, there is a title labeled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
23632	9	2	2	The author puts it in order from the events are happening.First it starts with different information about it and what is going on. Secondly, it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other. Thirdly, they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal. Last, it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing.
23635	9	2	2	The author organized the article by trying to catch the reader's attention first. Once they had done that they would organize all of their information based on categories of relevance, starting off by explaining what exactly they were talking about. In this case, it was space junk, and they defined it under a specific title explaining what it was. From there out, they used the same sort of technique, talking about how collisions are usually caused, how powerful the impacts of the microdebris could be, and gave each portion very clear titles that made it all easy to locate what you were looking for.
23643	9	2	2	In this article the author organizes each section begining with either a question or the topic in which the section is about to explain. For example, 'Crash Course' explains the colliding of satellites.
23646	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a scructure that assists in  explaining the situation and convincing the reader of the possible dangers that space junk poses. The author begins with statements that grap the reader's attention and introduce the topic being addressed.  Next, the author begins the section called 'What is Space Junk?' and he describes the history behind space exploration and how the idea of space junk has become a serious problem today.  Then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be.  The author finishes by explaining how difficult the situation is and how both NASA and the European Space Agency are both working on finding ways to avoid, prevent, and get rid of space junk.
23650	9	2	2	The author organized the article by having an introduction and putting the information into different catagories. The catagories use were, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
23651	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first explaining to the reader what this space junk is, then telling how it is created, and finally explaining how this space junk is very dangerous and should be prevented. To first inform the reader, the author gives a little bit of history about space travel, and then explains how space junk is created. The second part of the article then is used to explain a situation about how a crash of dead sattelites can create space junk. In the last part of the article the author gives information on why this space junk really is bad and harmful. The auhor finally ends the last part by telling us that there needs to be a way to try to find a solution to stop space pollution.
23654	9	2	2	The author oraganizes this article by explaining what space junk is, then telling how it occurs, and then going on to say how it affects the the atmosphere in outer space and astronauts. Examples of this are one, the first paragraphs after the introduction are about what space junk is, the second paragraph is about how space junk happens, and the final paragraph is about how space junk affects the atmosphere and astrnauts.
23657	9	2	2	The author begins the article 'Orbiting Junk' with a comment on something seen in space. They ask what it is and they find that it is a tool bag which seems absurd since it is in space. The author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk. He includes a little history regarding space operations as well as their purpose and the negative outcome they can have. The autho then goes on to state the dangers of dead satellites in space as they can crash into each other. He uses two example. The first one is the crash of a Russian and American satellite crashing into each other creating debris left in space. The second one, being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs. The author's conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do. He aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution.
23659	9	2	2	The author of this article organizes his detail in a introduction, three pharagraphs on his main points and a conclusion. The introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk. The next three main points are 'What is Space Junk', 'Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal all three of these paragraphs are explaining what the author is trying to write about in this aticle. The last point of the atricle, the conclusion, is to make you wonder about and make you want to do something about space junk and what is going on and how we can do something to make it go away.
23660	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four different sections that each describe a different aspect of his topic, 'Orbiting Junk.' He begins with an introduction that captures the reader's attention before taking on a serious tone to convey his message. In the section titled 'What Is Space Junk,' the author explains what it is he will be talking about and where it comes from. The author then goes on to describe the dangers of space junk in the last two sections, 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
23661	9	2	2	The author uses the introduction to grab the readers attention. In the second paragraph, the author defines space junk and uses the history of space junk.  In the third paragraph, the reader talks about the risk of space junk. Finally in the last paragraph, the reader talks about how scientists are trying to solve the problem.
23663	9	2	2	The author organized the article in an explaining order.  First the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky.  The in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' the author expalins what the 'junk' is that is orbiting.  As the author moves into 'Crash Course', the author talks about a true incident that happened in February 2009.  In the ending section, the author uses 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' to sum up that the space junk may be small, but it is a big deal and serious.
23676	9	2	2	The author organizes it by telling you what 'Space Junk' is and then he goes back and says whay it does to effect us. People do not realize what harm it could have.
23677	9	2	2	To begin, the author grabs the reader's attention with an interesting introduction. He/she then adresses the problem about 'space junk'. In the next section, the author explains what exactly 'space junk' is and gives some background information on it. The next section explains the dangers of the floating dead satellites, and gives an example 'in 2008, a tool bag escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repais on the Internationaal Space Station'. In the last section, he/she describes what scientists are trying to do to solve the persistent and increasing problem that is 'space junk'.
23679	9	2	2	The autor organizes the article by making different headlines for different topics. They set out certain bullet points that they want to talk about and then once they've mentioned the problem in the headline then they go into more detail about it. They have three different things that they talk about specificaly, one being 'What is Space Junk, the second being 'Crash Course' and the third being 'Litlle Bits, But a Big Deal.' The autor makes this an easy read becasue you don't have to read the whole thing to find what you're loooking for because they broke it up into diferent topics and into different paragrapghs.
23681	9	2	2	The author organized the article in a sequence of events ranging from how the satellites got into space to how they crash and then tells the reader of the broken satellites severity to other space crafts in orbit.  The author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next.
23687	9	2	2	The auther organizes the articles by titles about what he wants to talk about. Like in the article ' what is space junk?' he/ she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space.      In the article 'crash course he/she talks about how two satellites crsh into one anouther and how it effects the atmosphere and how it will cause truble in the fouter for spaceships.
23691	9	2	2	The author starts with a introduction. Then the author describes what space junk is. Next the author talks about how space junk can be created. Finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem.
23694	9	2	2	The way they organize this article is by explaning what space junk is to inform the reader.Then they explain the effect it has and why its a problem to our space program.then at last they give deatils about how it dangours and why we should do something about this problem.
23695	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by different concerns. For example, the first section, 'What Is Space Junk?' describes what 'space junk' is and how it negatively affects the environment. The second section, 'Crash Course', describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites 'flying through space', which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them. The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts, which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts.
23698	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the reader's attention.  The author starts by drawing in the reader's imagination and then informs him or her that this is a serious issue.  Right after the introduction the author knows he or she has the reader's attention and starts informing them of space junk.  Before all the information can bore the reader, the author changes the topic to Crash Course. This causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space. The author finishes off by telling the reader that this is a serious issue, but keeps the mood light by saying there is a tool bag loose in space.  This keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information.
23699	9	2	2	The author organize the article by brecking it down into peices. By using the names orbiting junk, What is space junk, Crash course, and Little bits, but a big deal,. By using this like that it makes the reader wanna read this stuff so ya it makes it istering.
23706	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a simple, yet structured way. Fortunately, for a topic such as this, the author seperates main ideas into their own sections, such as Crash Course and Little Bits, Big Problem. This type of article is easy for anyone to read and especially easy to find the information you are looking for in a quicker way opposed to perhaps looking it up in an encyclopedia.
23708	9	2	2	he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like 'what is space junk'
23709	9	2	2	It gives me brief information about the article.  Startng the article off with some hurmor 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a tool bag?'     Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.  The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.'  It goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself, and how it could be really dangerous.       The conclusion, just states that hopefully in the future, scientist can come up with a solution about how to solve the space pollution problem.
23710	9	2	2	The author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about. The author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information. He uses these subtitles to orginize his article. Under the subtitle 'Crash Course' the author tells about a collision that happend. These subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article. The author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article.
23715	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first defining what 'space junk' is, and then saying what causes it, and last by telling us how big of a deal it is and how much harm it can do. The paragraphs are titled by what it is going to tell you. In the third paragraph it explains how the objects crashing make debris and in the fourth it explains the damage they do.
23717	9	2	2	The author orginzes the article in to four catigories 'what is space junk', 'crash course' and, 'little bits but a big deal'.
23718	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by explaining different problems with orbiting space junk in each section. The author gives a section on what space junk is, how satellites are in space, and how microdebris can cause a big problem in space. The author gives a sequential order, and provides detail with each subject.
23727	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way.  First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction.  Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs.  The first one is called 'What is Space Junk?' This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course.'  This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous.  The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'  In this paragraph, the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small, it can still be dangerous at high speeds.
23729	9	2	2	The author separates his different information into groups, by content.  In the block under 'Crash Course', there is related information about space satellite crashes which create space junk.  He separated all his convincing information into three different blocks of information to keep make it easier to understand and stay on track.
23731	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by catching the reader's attention then informing them what space junk is. The next section, titled 'Crash Corse' explains how space debris is made and it lists specific examples such as the American and Russian satellites crashing into eachother in 2009. In the last section, the author explains why space debris are harmful and what is being done to help solve the problem.
23732	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a 'opening support conclussion' format. This meaning that the first section titled 'What is Space Junk?' is clearly going to talk about what space junk is. Which will create a nice segway to talk about 'Little Bits, But a big Deal'
23736	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in three sections.  The beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the report/story.       Each section explains something to do with the title, 'Orbiting Junk': What is Space Junk; Crash Course; Little Bits, But a Big Deal.     I prefer this form of organization, as it is easier to read and understand.
23738	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with titles. The name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about. What is Space Junk gives the reader an idea of the junk that's in space.
23745	9	2	2	The author organizes the article well. She starts off with interesting facts, and then comes to the real importance of the matter of the 'Space Junk' in orbit which is becoming a big problem, and ends it with telling people to become more aware because the problem is increasing.
23756	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three specific sections, 'What is space junk?', 'Crash Coarse', and 'Little Bits, But a BIg Deal'. Each section provides important statistics on the topic.
23757	9	2	2	The article is organized into sections. First the author defines the matter then goes on about what causes the debris and finishes up with saying that the debris is a big problem.
23760	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into different aspects of 'space junk.' For example, the author uses uses the subtitle 'What Is Space Junk?' to describe what 'space junk' is. He or she also uses subtitles such as 'Crash Course' to explain a few extraterrestrial crashes. This type of organization helps the article to remain as fluent as possible and to focus the reader on the negative effects of 'space junk.'
23766	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by like ideas. The introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article. The third section, 'Crash Course' shows the magnitude of the space junk with a specific instance on how it came to be. The forth and final section summarizes all the previous sections and makes the point that space junk orbiting the Earth really is a dangerous issue. Overall, the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend, bit-sized manner.
23775	9	2	2	He stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space. So look at the sky. Then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites. Then it tells you how satellites crash in space. Then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling.
23777	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting out w/ a famous pop culture reference that catches your attention, then they get to the serious stuff in the Introduction, explaining the timeline and statistics of space travel so that the reader gets the idea of what he or she is reading about. Following the Introduction is the Body of the article that explains the main idea further. Then comes the Conclusion that gives the author's opinion on the topic of the 'space junk' crisis.
23783	9	2	2	The author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky. Then, the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk. They talk about the variety of spacecrafts, space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, that have been sent out beyond Earth's atmosphere.They also talk about how many satellites end up crashing into eachother.Also, how little paticles or space junk moves 5 miles per second.
23789	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by sections, each section going into more detail about different 'space junk' topics.  The first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is. The next section titled 'Crash Course', explains the affects of having free-orbiting disabled satellites flying through space. The last section of the article, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' goes into detail about how microdebris lays a big impact on spacecrafts.
23795	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting it in headings.  He has headings such as What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
23796	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three sections, following the introduction. These are titled 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read.
23799	9	2	2	Well, first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting. Immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk' is. He then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk. Lastly, he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that NASA is looking for a solution.
23801	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a text book form.  With sections having titles, What is sapce junk, and then having information under the section titles. It has facts backing up they're statements.
23802	9	2	2	The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.
23804	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention. By then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a...tool bag,' it makes the reader want to read the article. The author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die.' The author finishes his/her article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is 'increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations  have undertaken  space exploration.'
23811	9	2	2	The Author oraganizes this artices very well. He starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works.Next, He would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used. At last, he talked about tiny bits of space trash. So over all he did really well oragnizing this article.
23818	9	2	2	The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention. Then, the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space. After that, the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other, creating microdebris. Next, the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris, known as microdebris, can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris. And finally, the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space.
23829	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way. The author has chosen to set it up by and seperate the paragraphs by sections, not just spacing and indenting. The author started with background information, then transitioned into information about how free floating satellites, and then concluded with statistics and information from NASA and other space agencies about how space exploration should be done in a more organized and clean way.
23832	9	2	2	The author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' Then the author told the reader about space junk and the risk it causes like dead satellites at the risk of colliding with each other.  Then the author lets the reader know that space junk is a big deal and people do care about it.
23840	9	2	2	The author organizes this article he starts with the intoduction telling what it is about and then he gives a background on space junk and early space explorations. The writer then proceeds to tell about how space juk becomes space junk and then goes on to tell why it is harmful and dangerous and why we should worry about it.
23846	9	2	2	He uses sub headings such as 'What Is Space Junk', and 'Crash Course'.
23848	9	2	2	The author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about. Like the heading 'Crash Course' that tells you that this section will be about something that is crashing into something.
23851	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter.
23856	9	2	2	The authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled, pertinant sections. Each section relates to the main idea, which is that there is waste orbiting in space. The section labeled 'What Is Space Junk?' describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from. 'Crash Course' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut. The final section talks about the size of the objects orbiting earth does not matter because the speed is what causes the most damage.
23864	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph 'What Is Space Junk?' in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk. In the Second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk. In the last paragrapgh he titled it 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' meaning that even the little pieces of space junk can be a big deal. The pieces are so little but yet so powerful.
23871	9	2	2	He explains every topic in a different section. He begins with Space Junk which tells about junk and satellites. He then explains other topic like Crash Course and other little things that fly in the air.
23873	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title.  At first the tells us what the orbiting junk is, then explains a little about how it can cause a crash, and then how we need to get these out of space. The is how the author organizes this article.
23875	9	2	2	How the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory. For example, the category 'Crash Course' is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another.
23881	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first using an introduction to get the reader's attention and to introduce the topic that will be discussed. He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk. The author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic. This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris. He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact. His next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better. The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts. The last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution.
23882	9	2	2	Obviously, it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article. He begins with an exciting introduction to his topic before establishing his thesis about the dangers of 'space junk.' He then goes on to describe the history of the world's journey into the galaxy and touch on the unpredicted ramifications of such an adventure. Toward the end, the author focuses on the modern problems created by space exploration and how it is imperative for them to be solved before considering future risks of more exploration.
23893	9	2	2	He organizes it by first getting the reader's attention by using shocking statements in the introduction. Then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk. Then the author tells about because of so many 'dead' satellites they can crash into each other cause they are freely orbiting the earth. Then he or she states that even though after crashes in space and all the little pieces of the satelillets can still harm the earth, because of how much speed is being increased.
23896	9	2	2	The author makes everything build upon each other. first, the aurthor grabbed the readers attention. second, the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk. then, the author ended the article by give statistics and statements that make the reader notice the severity of space junk.
23897	9	2	2	The author uses an 'attention-getter' at the beggining of the article to draw readers in.  He then changes his tone to that of a more formal one.  Underneath the title 'What Is Space Junk,' he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is.  Next, he uses 'Crash Course' to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space.  Lastly, he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause.
23905	9	2	2	The author organizes this article with an introduction into the topic, followed by explaining the subject and the effects it holds.  The author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled 'What Is Space Junk?'  Throughout these paragraphs the author gives examples of what space junk is, as well as an example of what happens if 'space junk' were in the Earth's atmosphere.  The author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk.  The author makes these description in the paragraphs of 'Crash Course.' Throughout the paragraphs 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' the author then explains the effects the space junk has on the spacecrafts sent into orbit.
23910	9	2	2	The author organizes this article 'Orbiting Junk' into specific sections. He goes through the order you need to know things. He gives you the background, or history, of Space Junk. Then, he went into Crasc Course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years. Finally, he gets omtp Little Bits, But a Bif Deal and this section talks about how small something can be but make a big problem.
23916	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups. We start of with the Orbiting Junk subgroup, which is the opening paragraghs. Next, we move on to What Is Space Junk, which explains the history of space exploration. It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag. This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is. So that is how the author organizes this well written article. It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read.
23919	9	2	2	He organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject. For example under 'What Is Space Junk?', he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used. Under 'Crash Course', he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a free-orbiting satellite. But under 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',  it meantions about how tiny debris can cause serious problems.
23925	9	2	2	The author organizes it by dividing it into sections that reflect the size of the different types of space junk. In the second section, Crash Course, the author explains the dangers of the larger debris while in the third section, Little Bits, But a Big Deal, The author explains the dangers of small particles and objects to spacecraft.
23934	9	2	2	They organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation. The sections sre 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Coruse', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
23939	9	2	2	The author organizes the article using an introduction, two body sections and then a conclusion. In the introduction the author describes what the article is about by stating in paragraph 3, 'Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.' The author gives excellent examples of how the 'space junk' came to be and explained how and why these pieces of debris are not good. The author concludes by taking the article a step forward and showing that we can solve the problem of 'space junk'.
23941	9	2	2	The autor organizes the article very well. The introduction is very integuing, pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem. The author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere. The section titled 'Crash Course' posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk. This includes the problem of satelights running into each other. The author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment.
23942	9	2	2	In this article, the author organizes the paragraphs into an introduction mentioning space junk (with humor), a paragraph explaining what space junk is, specific details about crashes that bring to light what COULD happen in the future, a section describing the harmful effects of tiny debris, and finally a paragraph that explains how the effects are increasing and how nations are working together to come up with a 'viable solution to space polllution.' This organization technique is common in information essays. First, the problem is introduced, and from there the problem is discussed with background information, statistics, comparisons, analogies, and inferences. For example, the author uses the comparison of sand 'shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall' in the section that describes the harmful effects of small debris.
23947	9	2	2	The author organize's the article by headlines before talking about the article. For example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says What Is Space Junk? Then it goes on to tell us about space junk. After paragraph five it has the headline that says Crash Course, and it goes on to talk about that, and lastly after paragraph seven it has the head line that says Little Bits, But a Big deal, and they go on to discribe that.
23948	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a very logical way. He begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader. He follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk. Next, he describes the severity of this topic. Lastly, he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem.
23952	9	2	2	The organization of the article is simple, yet very effective for the reader to truly understand the concept of space junk. In the beginning with the article called 'Orbiting Junk' the author creates an intresting lead in to draw in the reader. After that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites. I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' I liked this because I had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was free-floating in space. I like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held.     Through this organization of introduction, body, and conclusion, the reader was able to understand how space junk is a serious matter.
23954	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the reader's attention.  Next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction.  Throughout the article, until the conclusion, the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be.  Lastly, the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem.
23957	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother. First the author explains what Space junk is, then describes the dangers of the junk, and finally explains why the junk is a big deal.
23960	9	2	2	They list the sections in order of importance. To begin, after they have the reader's attention from their introduction, they explain what exactly causes the problem that they will later define.     Next, they use the section 'Crash Course' to show that this isn't just a rare occurence that we will never really have to worry about, but that it is a very problematic situation that we must prepare for.     Finally, they show that as satellites colide and are smashed into smaller bits, they become even more dangerous because there is a higher chance of them colliding because of their great numbers.
23961	9	2	2	He or she starts off by informing the reader what space junk is, setting the tone, making sure the reader understands what's going on first. Second He or she talks about the satellites crashing. Third he or she talks about no matter how small the debri is it can still do heavy damage when going five miles per second.
23966	9	2	2	The author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about 'space junk'. Then, he explain more clearly about 'space junk' in the 'What Is Space Junk'. Next is the evidence of the danger 'sapce junk' can make in 'Crash Course'. Finally, in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', the author points out how serious it is and 'space junk' need to be solved by the corporation of nations.
23967	9	2	2	The author starts out by telling the reader about past space explorations and how long ago and when the space race began. He also goes along and talks about how small debris in space can make a big inpact on the earth and the damage it can do to the earth and the people on it. The author then goes along and talks about recent problems witht he debris in space and the two satellites crashing into eachother and the impact it had on the planet.
23972	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with little articles in it. The first one grabs the attention of the reader and gives you an idea on what the article is going to e about. The second one is to help the reader understand the history of space exploration and how long people on earth have been doing it. The thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk. The last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is.
23986	9	2	2	The author first tells you what 'Space Junk' is, then the author gives examples of how debri can be dangerous by telling you two stories about satillites crashing. At the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause.
23987	9	2	2	The author arganizes the artical by separating the information into sections that best fit the category that they belong to. 'Orbiting Junk,' the title of the artical, clarifies how space junk is a concern to government space agencies around the globe. 'What Is Space Junk?', defines and gives history to what the term means and how it came to be, just as how it sounds in the heading of the section.
23992	9	2	2	First the writer grabs your attention with the introduction. Then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled 'What is Space Junk.' Next he talks about how the satellites in orbit now can get smaller due to the fact that they could run into each other causing more debry in the section titled 'Crash Course.' And finally thewriter tells us how the little objects floating around there now are a big deal and the more that the satellites break the more debry their will be in the future that section is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
23996	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into four main parts 'Orbiting Junk', 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
23998	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk.  Each subtopic, such as 'Orbiting Junk' and 'Crash Course,' highlights an individaul aspect of the problems caused by space junk while supporting the authors statement that space junk is a serious problem.
24002	9	2	2	The author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand. First he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea. Then he explains what makes the 'Space Junk.' Next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious. Finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is.
24003	9	2	2	The author begins the article with a kidding tone.  The introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections.  'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are all have a much more serious tone.  'What is Space Junk' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is.  It also foreshadows the potential problems of space junk by asking 'What happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions.'  'Crash Course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves.  Such as colliding satellites.  'Little Bits, But a Big Deal describes other bad situations of space junk and the very serious problems they can cuase.  Problems like 'disastrous holes'.
24005	9	2	2	They organize it by making up sections. For example, 'What is Space Junk' and 'Crash Course.' Having sections makes it easier to find the information you're looking for.
24008	9	2	2	I believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article. An example of good orginaziton is that he dosn't get side tract. They used good headings like What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24010	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section. For example, in the article Little Bits, But a Big Deal, the author talks about how even the smallest fragments in space can be dangerous. The author organizes this article very well and it's easier to understand.
24012	9	2	2	First, it starts off how every good essay starts off. With a good hook, to bring readers into it. Next comes the beginning statement, the sentence that tells the audiance what the writer is writing about and where they stand. After that, you have the body, which, in this case, is made up of the history of space travel, the information of how much and what makes up the debris, and finally, the impact it has on our space explorers. After these statements, comes the closure of the article, giving all of the well rounded information that it is steadily increasing.
24013	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by having a strong, attention-grabbing introduction and three main topics that support his opinion on the harm of space junk orbiting Earth. His conclusion paragraph states that there is an awareness of need for a solution to the three suggested issues, but no solutions have been drawn by any nation thus far.
24016	9	2	2	The author starts with an attention getter. Next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is. Further more the author segways into the risks of dead satelites which he finished speaking about at the end of the first section. Lastly, the final section is about how space debris is dangerous and how it's a topic that many care about and it's not a small matter.
24027	9	2	2	The author goes from telling what space junk is then to satilites crashing and finally to little debris in space that can harm you
24032	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first introducing the problem at the beginning and then explaining the matter. Then the article goes on to talking about how the space trash and satellites can crash and creating dozens of pieces and debris. Then from the crash, the article explains how the little microdebris can also cause a huge bad impact also.
24036	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by having an introduction that grabs the readers attention. Then they going on to explain what the topic of space junk is. Finally they going into different section of how space junk is dangerous.
24040	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in to diffrent sections so that we can learn about diffrent things about how space debre is formed. The articles names are ' What is Space Junk?' 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24048	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by grouping together similar topics and titling them in order of describing space junk to the solution of space junk. It starts with 'What Is Space Junk?' and ends with 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.

24051	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure. There is the introduction, followed by the three subtitles: 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs.
24052	9	2	2	The author puts all the main points as his title. in the article it says what is space junk, then it has all of the information about space junk underneath it.
24058	9	2	2	He organizes it by sections, by 3 different parts. One is, 'What is space junk', 'Crash Crouse', And 'Little bits, But a big deal'.
24060	9	2	2	The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24063	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'What Is Space Junk?' In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space. Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space.
24064	9	2	2	The author organized the article, 'Orbiting Junk' by adding different sections of reading.  In saying sections, I am referring to the titles through out the article.  'What Is Space Junk?''Crash Course' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'Those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article.
24065	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.
24067	9	2	2	He organizes the article by titling things in sections like, 'What is Space Junk' and only talks about what is needed in that section and 'Crash Course' is another way the author broke up the article.
24077	9	2	2	In this selection the author organizes his/her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other. For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next.
24078	9	2	2	The author begins the article with an attention grabber, in order to make the reader interested in the topic.  Giving the reader a little information regarding space junk, the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.  The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem.
24083	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better. The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk?', goes to how some space junk is created 'Crash Course', and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24085	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics.  This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic.  The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's Superman!'  but with a unique spin.  The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic.
24087	9	2	2	The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.
24093	9	2	2	The author started off by telling us what space junk is, then went into the different catergories. 'What is Space Junk', is the title for the first couple of paragraphs.
24094	9	2	2	The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about. What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there. Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher. And the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it.
24095	9	2	2	They break it into sections, which allows the reading to get a better understaning. For example, in the introduction 'Grab your telescope!' allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence. In the What Is Space Junk? section 'In 1957, the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite.' This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on. In Crash Course, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other.' This shows risks and what could happen. Little Bits, But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' Shows why we should be worried.
24099	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical into groups. He explans all of the groops: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working.
24100	9	2	2	He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you. Then he tells you what space junk is basically. After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth. Little Bits, But a Big Deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris, but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed.
24103	9	2	2	The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about. The next paragraph is 'What is Space Junk' which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space.  The last section is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all.
24107	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section.  For instance, one of the titles is called, 'Crash Course.'  This section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication.
24115	9	2	2	the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is, what is couses, and how we are affected. each section is wsell informed and organized. such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled (Crash Course).
24116	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.
24118	9	2	2	The author starts out the article with an introduction the will grab the readers attention and make them keep reading. He also catorgorises each section with a title like; 'what is space junk','crash course', and 'little bits, but big deal' to let the reader know what each paragraph is about. the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions.
24119	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by, first grabbing the readers attention, then describing what space junk really is, then how space junk is formed, and lastly why we should care about it, and what we can do to reduce space junk.
24123	9	2	2	The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
24124	9	2	2	They organize it into subject matter: 'What IS space junk?','Crash Cource', and 'Little Bits, Bit a Big Deal.' They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections.
24133	9	2	2	The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk. Then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit. In paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth. Also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space.
24134	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.
24135	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.  The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem.  There are even titles to go along with the clasifications including: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24137	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four major groups; the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24140	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information.
24150	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into diffrent categories. In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk?' it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere. In the article called 'Crash Course' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008.
24156	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.
24160	9	2	2	He organize his article in the way he is talking about what is Space Junk? in one seccion, crash course in other seccion, and Little Bits, but a Big Deal in other seccion so we can understand better because everything is not together.
24162	9	2	2	This article is organized with a fairly common format. First is a small, shocking anecdote, which serves to grab the attention of the reader. Then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous. These are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time.
24164	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by first catching the reader's attention with lines 1 and 2 in the introduction with an unbelievable statement that seems false. Next, the author wants to tell you about the history of sattelites and other objects we have sent in to space and how they are still orbiting this earth. This lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere. Crash Course and Little Bits, But a Big Deal tell us how dangerous all of these large and small bits are to astronauts and sattelites. At the end of the last paragraph the author concludes that scientists are trying to find a way to clear or avoid these bits of matter. Therefore, that is how the author organizes this article.
24172	9	2	2	The author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites. Then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter. Then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal.
24173	9	2	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' effectively organizes his piece to inform the reader of the dangers of space trash. He begins with an introduction, and gives the reader interest along with the basic background needed to understand the purpose of the article.      The author then moves into the section of 'What is Space Junk,' where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion. He tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race, and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating 'space junk.'     In 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal' the author uses strong language, unknown problems with space junk, and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race. He ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing, leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution.
24174	9	2	2	The author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand. The author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section 'What Is Space Junk?'. He then explains in 'Crash Course' what happens. And then in the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author explains to the reader why this problem is such a big deal.
24175	9	2	2	The author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained. The tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous. The author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things. Afterwards the article tells how the microdebris can destroy things launched into space and gives an analogy to give a picture. Then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing  and how it IS a huge problem.
24179	9	2	2	He explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky. Next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it. Then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other. Objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts. Finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do.
24185	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by headlines. He uses the headlines 'What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal' to seperate information.
24186	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by using headings. The different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk. Under the section titled 'What is Space Junk?', the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated. Under 'Crash Course' the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother. Finally, the in 'Little Bits, But big Deals' the author explains how the little things that are inspace can potentially cause great problems.
24187	9	2	2	First the author starts out very enthusiastic and wanting to actually tell you about the topic he wants to express. The author uses a very catchy introduction and it really got me hooked from the first time i read it. Then he gets serious and starts telling about how 'space junk' is really a harmfull thing and we are under estimating what it can do. Then he starts talking about crash course which tells you how people cant control dead satellites but they are still a major threat.
24188	9	2	2	The author breaks the article up into four parts; Orbiting Junk, What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24193	9	2	2	The author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about. They then move on to overviewing what 'space junk' consists of, and how it came to be. After that they deliver information about satellites crashing into one another, and how that forms debris that orbits around our Earth. Finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and Earth's surface.
24196	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by explaining what the article is about and then telling how dangerous it can be even if it is only a small piece. 'What is Space Junk,' tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was. The section 'Crash Course,' tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces. The last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite. It also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles, but sometimes can not avoid them all. This article explains what 'Space Junk' is and how it affects the satellites, it also explains how much damage something so little can do.
24198	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing. 'What Is Space Junk?' describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader. 'Crash Course' is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the Earth. Last but not least, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' states various instintances where tiny debris can harm the biggest of objects due to the speed that it is traveling and the dangers of having space junk. The author let's the reader know what each part will be about.
24200	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat. The author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit. In the next section section the author describes what happens to the debris when it is outer space and how it can pose major problems. Finally the author explains the threat of the debris to humans and what is being done to counteract the space pollution.
24205	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in small sections with only a few paragraphs to explain the subtopic in each section. The subtopic What Is Space Junk? consists of two paragraphs. It is all under the main Topic, Orbiting Junk.
24209	9	2	2	The author separates the article in 4 different categories. The order of the article is the introduction, explaining what space junk is, explaining what happens in space with the space junk, and lastely explaining the dangers of space junk.
24210	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting out with a general idea, then focusing into details of that idea as you continue on in the section. In the introduction, the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way. Next, in the first section, space junk is defined for the reader and it is explained why space junk is in space. Then, in the next section, Crash Course, some problems with space junk are introduced, as well as some more details. Finally, in the last section, the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced. Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article. The author has organized this article by starting with a general topic of space junk, then adding more detail and ideas to that topic as the article continues.
24211	9	2	2	The author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the 'Orbiting Junk' headline. The author then proceeds to give the reader background information on space junk in the 'What Is Space Junk?' headline. The author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course. After that, the author shows how little pieces of junk can have a huge and costly impact on the space inviornment. The passage is written like an essay with an introduction, body, and a conclusion.
24217	9	2	2	The author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space. The next section, entitled 'What Is Space Junk?', explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth. The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', explains how satellites can collide with each other, and create many more dangerous free-orbiting satellites. The final section, entitled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', expalins how the smallest space junk can create problems, such as damage to space craft.
24218	9	2	2	The author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk. The begining of each new section tells you facts about debris or history that gets you interested on reading more. What Is Space Junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place. Talking about the first launch and the space race in the Cold War. Crash Course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind. Little Bits, But a Big Deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft. It also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem.
24221	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs. The subtitle 'What is Space Junk' describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created. The subtitle 'Crash Course' provides a specific example of space debris being created. The subtitle 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' Describes the Harmful effects of space junk.
24224	9	2	2	The author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like 'It's a . . . tool bad? Then the author gives the reader a background on space junk and what it can do out in outer space. The author then concludes that this 'debris' or 'junk' can collide in space, and the little fragments can cause damage as well as big fragments.
24234	9	2	2	He begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention. Then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about Space junk. Once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time. On how it becomes space junk and dont get taken out and stay there orbitting the earth and end up crashing with each other and become more of a problem.
24239	9	2	2	The author organized this article by using subtitles like 'What Is Space Junk?' First, the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article.
24242	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by an attention grabber, then, telling us what space junk is, netx, telling us about the collision of satellites in space, then, lastly, the author explains the dangers of space junk in space. No matter how small the space junk is, it is dangerous.
24244	9	2	2	To begin with, the author organizes the article in which he gets the readers attention by saying 'Grab your telescope! Look up at the sky! Its a comet! It's a meteor!' Next, the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk. In this section it says 'In 1957 the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.'  Then the article tells about the crash course. Finally, it tells about how the little pieces in space are a big deal when they are moving fast. These small pieces can cause damage, because of the rate of speed that they are moving.
24246	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in sections. The first paragraph, the introduction, introduces the topic of the article. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly. The third section, 'Crash Course', shows how the problem began. The forth section, 'Little BIts, But a Big Deal', shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the Earth.
24247	9	2	2	The Author organizes the article into three sections. He talks about three very important probles in space. One section talks about and describes what is space junk. For example, it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk. The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships. The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal.
24251	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other. The introduction serves to catch the reader's attention, 'What is Space Junk' informs the reader about what exactly space junk is, and the final two sections inform us of the author's opinions on space junk.
24255	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking it up into smaller bits of information that all have to do with one another subject wise. The sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand, and gives information so you understand the next article. This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk?' part, you wouldn't understand what space junk is in the next two sections.
24262	9	2	2	The author starts on a somewhat fast pace, trying to grab the reader's attention. It starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space. Then it goes to 'Crash Course', which tells about how all them satellites and other space debris collide at speeds that are very fast. And finally, 'Little Bits' which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites.
24268	9	2	2	The author starts off by telling us what space junk is. Which is debrie from satelittes and tools. Then he tells us how space junk is created. He tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box. Next the author says that even the smallest bits of the space junk is harmfull and can do serious damage. Finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts.
24270	9	2	2	The author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used. He describes many of the passages by showing what can happen. For example in 'Crash Course' he tells about how satellites can come to collide with each other and cause serious damage and make more space debris. Also in the passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author shows what can happen to an object whenever it gets hit by debris by noting what a sandblaster can do to a concrete wall.
24274	9	2	2	The author breaks the article into three parts which are, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. The author does this so he can get the point of each section across in an easier way to understand.
24275	9	2	2	The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader's attention.  He then explores the topic in more detail, using three different sections.  The first one, entitled 'What is Space Junk?' explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth.  The next section, 'Crash Course,' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide.  Finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains why space junk is a problem  and why it is important to find a solution.
24276	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking down the main points into sessions instead of just reading it with no explanation. It starts off with a problem, the problem is explained, the problem happens, then finally it says how the problem can be taken care of.       The introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article. It holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky.      The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is. It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space. They raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future.      The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem. It says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around.       Finally, the last section tells us how we can care. Clean-up is possible. But, it is still dangerous in space. Many fragments float around that cannot be detected. It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free.     The article is organized chronoligically. They state, a problem, and throughout the paragraph, they say what happens and how efforts are being amde to make it better.
24282	9	2	2	'What Is Space Junk?' is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage. it tells us some starter facts and other things.     'Crash Course' explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.     'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail, what space junk really is and the dangers of it.  It explains that it's not going, like, five miles and hour, but THOUSANDS!
24284	9	2	2	The author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction.   Each section has a main focus, but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris.  The introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here.  Then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination.  The following section explains collisions involving space debris.  The last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article.
24285	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories. They give a brief summary in the introduction, and go straight into the first section; 'What is Space Junk?' The author explains what space junk is, and how it is formed.      Next, they go into what happens if two space satellites collide with each other, in the 'Crash Course' section of the article. They give examples about this topic.     And finally, they end the article with the 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section. This talks about the seriousness of space junk.     So overall, the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects, based on the different topics of space junk. This makes the article very easy to read and to understand.
24287	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by catching the readers attention with the introduction and then give the reader son historical facts about how the space junk got into space. The author then states that the satilites are at a higher risk of coliding with each other and causeing more debry. The last section the author mentions is that the smallest debri can cause massive damage to a space craft that is in orbit.
24290	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in sections. Furst, the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention. Then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is. the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident. Finally the author ends the article by telling of the dangers of space kunk and what it can do to effect the earth.
24293	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical by subtitles. some of the subtitles they used are What Is Space Junk? and Crash Course
24294	9	2	2	The author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government's concern with it. He then writes of how the 'junk' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue. He tells of the variety as well. Next, he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions ,and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space. He goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article. He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space. He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel. He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution. This organization is done to make sure to hold the interest of the reader until the end so that they will finish reading the article to educate themselves on the issue of space junk and how it pertains to them.
24295	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then providing the dangers of it. They then explain how space junk is created by space capsules, telescopes, satellites, and even astronauts themselves. At the end of the article, the author explains ways scientists are trying to solve the problem, but will not be able to fully do so. This shows how serious the problem is.
24300	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario.  Then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is.  After that he tells us how even space junk is small it can still provide a large amount of damage, because of the speed it is traveling at.  The author then closes the article by giving in detail how the different space agencies planned to solve the problem of space debris.  This article was organized to give facts to the reader, but at the same time make it easy to understand and interesting.
24305	9	2	2	The author organizees the article in an easy to understand way.  First the author catches your attention and states the problem.  Then in the section 'What Is Space Junk?', they quickly describe what space junk is and how it is created.  In the section titled 'Crash Course', the author shows evidence of satellites colliding and how they produced more microdebris.  In the final section they explain how the space garbage can cause complications for spacecraft.  Overall, the article was assembled in a simple way that made it easy to understand for any reader.
24306	9	2	2	The author organized the article by using an introduction what an attention getter to get the reader's interest. He/She then uses facts about the history of Earth's Space Invasion, which caused the mess of space junk. Afterwards, the author explains that space junk can collide into one another. Lastly, he/she explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous.
24309	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four different sections. The author first starts the article with an introduction paragraph about space junk that foreshadows what the rest of the article contains. Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life. The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth. Finally, the last section tells the reader how dangerous space junk can be at high speeds and how this space pollution is still affecting space travel today.
24318	9	2	2	He begins with an Introduction and then goes on the describe what space junk is, then talks about a crashing of satellites, and then finally why such small pieces are such a big deal.
24321	9	2	2	The author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come. In the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us. In the Crash Course section she talks about satellites and how they have failed to work before and how that affects things. In the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration.
24324	9	2	2	The author organizes the aritcle by topic.  Such as the titles 'What is Space Junk?' and 'Crash Course' These titles help us understand the things the author is trying to explain.
24327	9	2	2	It begins with a humorous, surprising hook, followed by explaining what 'space junk' is, after it tells readers about examples of said 'space junk', and ends with why people should care about it. The titles of the section and article, 'Orbiting Junk', 'What IS Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', do a good job at summing up what the sections and article is about.
24328	9	2	2	The author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer. One subtitle is named 'Crash Course', the paragraph then explains how the crash coarse in made and how it is dangerous.
24332	9	2	2	The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.
24334	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion. He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk'. Then, he provides the audience with information about what space junk is. The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space. He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact.
24335	9	2	2	The author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space. The author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting, into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space. To add credibility, a actual account is stated that relates how serious this problem of space junk can be. Finally, the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved.
24343	9	2	2	The author organizest the article very well. The author uses the introduction to get the point across. He then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research. This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.
24345	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized.
24352	9	2	2	The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
24353	9	2	2	In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.
24354	9	2	2	The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk.
24357	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.
24362	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by separating the information into different sections, each focusing on one aspect of the main subject, with each individual section leading into the next. In the first section, for example, the main idea is introduced through a creative opening that grabs the reader's attention and provokes interest in the topic. The next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began. The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur. The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem, despite the small size of the debris. In this way, the information from each section builds upon what was presented in the preceding section, but each has its own specific topic. As this is an informational article, it is arranged in a logical order to provide the best understanding of the facts.
24365	9	2	2	He organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is. During that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction. He then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them. Then he goes into what space trash and space junk is.
24369	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things. He first talks about Space Junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space. Then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened. Finaly, he then talks about space microdebris which realy affects the space which could destroy astronauts spaceships whenever they go up to space.
24372	9	2	2	This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.
24375	9	2	2	The author breaks down the article into three different sections. This helps you better know about space junk in general, when they collide and what happens, and how harmful the little peices of debri can be.

In the beginning, he has a very good introduction that actually draws a reader into the story. Next, the author really explains to the reader what space junk is. The author then explains how satellites can crash together producing smaller space junk, and the author then concludes by stating why this information matters. If these seperate sections were out of order, the story would not flow close to as well as it does.
24399	9	2	2	In the beginning of the article, the author uses the introduction as a way of grabbing the reader's attention. The phrase, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' is used to try to grab the reader's attention ny using a famous phrase, and fitting it for the useful purpose of the article. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them.      'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.
24400	9	2	2	By explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there. Then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there. Finally talks about all the little pieces and how space ships have the hardest time driving through space avoiding all the garbage floating around.
24401	9	2	2	In the first section called orbiting junk he introducess us to space junk and gets us interested in his article.  After that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk.  Then he talks about the dangers of sending objects into space because they can run into each other in crash course.  In the final section called little bits but a big deal he talks about why it is important to fix this problem.
24402	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction, explanation, and conclusion. The author begins by creating the introduction, showing the beginning of space exploration. As the author continues through the essay, he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris. This allows the reader to have background knowledge on space debris, and then have factual information about the disasterous debris. Finally, the author has a conclusion, which includes specific examples of space debris disaster and the chances of more catastrophe in the future. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' (Orbiting 1). The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration.
24403	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories.  He begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader.  Then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed.  The third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such.  The very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem.  Overall, the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view.
24404	9	2	2	The author organizes the articles by putting them in categories. For instance they are, What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.

In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.
24421	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by firstly creating a good 'hook' to get the reader interested in the rest of his/her article.  From here the author explains the beginnings of space exploration and how space junk has been emerging as a growing problem since then (Paragraph 5).  After this the author further explains and provides reasoning for the growing amount of space junk in the atmosphere and the problems it poses.  After this, the author explains why even the smallest objects can be the most dangerous and hazardous to spacecraft.  Finally, the author wraps up the article by restating the problem, increasing amounts of space pollution, and by concluding the article.
24423	9	2	2	Firstly the author grabs the readers attention. Then author jumpss right into details as two what is 'space junk' is and how it got into space. Thirdly  the author explains how satellites collide in space and become 'space junk'. Lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution.
24432	9	2	2	In the introduction, the author tries to hook the reader in about 'space junk.'  Then he tries to explain what 'space junk' is and that it is a great concern around the globe.  For example, in the article it stated that microdebris fields are so small that they cannot be detected and if it hits a spacecraft, it can be damaged.  The author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease.
24440	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by seperating different subjects under subtitle. For example, under the subtitle 'Crash Course', the author explains the time when the American and Russian satellites crashed into oneanother.
24443	9	2	2	The author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is 'space junk'. This allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible. It also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly.

They then highlight what is causing this problem and give many examples of satellites that have turned into 'space junk'. Next, they talk about how harmful these tiny fragments can be. Finally they offer a positive note by stating that 'space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution'.
24451	9	2	2	The author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk.  Then he tells us that dead satellites have the risk of crashing into each other, creating hundreds of pieces of dedris.  Lastly, he tells us that little bits of space junk can have a big impact on spacecraft.
24455	9	2	2	The auther orabizes the article in sections. Diffrent sections depending on what the paragaph was about. The first was space junk, that described what space junk is, and how it came about. the second was. 'little Bits, But a Big Bit' witch described how even small peces of space junk affect the space ships.
24458	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline. He or she first starts out by saying that you see something fall from space that is unusual to see. He or she then tells you what space junk is. Then the author tells you why this is a problem by saying that space junk can crash into other space junk and space ships. He or she finally tells you that people care about what is happening in space and that they would like to do something about it in the future.
24461	9	2	2	The author organizes the article well, by putting information in certain sections. The author for example talks about an American and Russian satellite colliding into each other. The author puts thihs information under a section called Crash Course. The author puts the information, into specificly titled sections, which makes this a very organized passage.
24462	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting it into specific sections. The introduction, which was to get the reader interested. 'What Is Space Junk', which was to describe the debris and the effect it's having on Earth. 'Crash Course, which was to provide details about how satellies have crashed due to this debris. And last the closer paragraph 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which describes that just the littlest of space debris can be harmful.
24464	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections. For example, when the author wants to inform readers about what space junk actually is, the author titles that section 'What Is Space Junk?'
24466	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a very organized way.  The article begins with an enticing introduction.  Curious readers will want to continue reading the article to learn about what 'space junk' is and what it does.  The next section explains to readers what space junk is.  It explains how space junk got into the atmosphere, where it is located, and how space junk came about in the atmosphere.  The third section descirbes a specific event that led to space junk.  The final section explains the dangers of space junk.  It also informs readers of how scientists are trying to overcome the issue of space junk.
24470	9	2	2	The author sorted the article into four main sections.  These are the introduction, a section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', a section called 'Crash Course', and the conclusion titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.

Then the article goes on to say that space junk is becoming a problem.  The body paragraphs in the next two sections expand on this problem by explaining what space junk actually is and what other challenges it poses.     In the conclusion section, the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
24473	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in different titled sections. The Introduction to draw you into the article, the second section to describe the space junk, the third to show what happens when space junk collides, and the last section to show that very small space junk is a large problem for space crafts.
24474	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections. Each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last. Section one is the explaination of the story. Section two talks about what space junk is. Section three explains the dangers of orbiting satellites and section four explains the way scientists are trying to find solutions to the space junk problem.      Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested. Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration. It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period.      Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace. It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space. Section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to do.      In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system. I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place.
24479	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with different sections that go in a logical order according to what the artilce is talking about. The different sections the authour uses are 'Orbiting Junk' as the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?' as a body part of the body, 'Crash Course' as another part of the body, and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' as the conclusion.
24482	9	2	2	The author organize his artivle very well. He starts off with a quite commical introduction but then changes tone and become very serious when talking about the next section 'What Is Space Junk?'. Then he continues and talk about the section 'Crash Crouse'. Next he then explain his next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. He was very organize and got his point across.
24484	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by splitting it up into several sections, with each section informing a different subtopic, while staying relevant to the overall subject at hand. He begins with a general definition of space junk in the introduction, to warm up the readers for what is to come. Then, in the next section, he begins to change his tone as he starts the discussion on pollution in space. In Crash Course, he explains that satellites will also collide with each other, and make the problem bigger, becoming even more serious yet in tone. He then concludes with his last section by stating the severity of the subject, and implying that something needs to be done about the problem.
24485	9	2	2	The author begins by grabbing your attention with a snappy little anecdote, after that he goes into a short explaination of how orbital pathways around our planet are becoming more cluttered. Then he explains what the 'space junk' actually is. then he talks about how satellites can colide with space junk and be destroyed. lastly the author explains how dangerous a small piece of debris traveling at a high rate of speed can greatly affect the structural integrity of manned space craft and satellites alike.
24496	9	2	2	The organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader.  These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful.     The author continues with background information.  The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk.  We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space.  The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites.  By making this reference, readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices.     The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk.  It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles.  The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes.  Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles.     In closing, the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem.  Though space junk is increasing, the author is hopeful for a solution.
24497	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk. The three topics are 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten  the reader about space.

24509	9	2	2	First the author presents the problem, space junk. Next he explains what space junk is. After that he explains how space junk is created, which is by free-orbiting satellites crashing into each other. Finally he explains what organizations like NASA and ESA are doing to solve the problem. The sub-paragraphs give it away. Such as, What IS Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24512	9	2	2	the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects. the author decribes what space junk is then, how it gets there, and finaly how it can effect the safety of our astonats and space ships.
24514	9	2	2	The author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information. for example, the header stating 'What Is Space Junk?' has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is. The header stating 'Crash Course' has the information about what happens when two satellites collide.
24516	9	2	2	The author organizes the article one step at a time. They start off with an introduction that catches the reader's eye. Then, they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous. After that, they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous. Finally, they end with saying that NASA is trying to fix this problem.
24518	9	2	2	The author begins his article with an attention-grabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations. Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk.' From this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space. After that he gives a past event from February 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs. Next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide. Finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it.
24522	9	2	2	The author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing.  The author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about.  The author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment.  The author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing.
24526	9	2	2	The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.
24528	9	2	2	The author puts the story in different sections. For example one section is 'What is Space Junk?' and the next section is 'Crash Course'.
24529	9	2	2	At first the author brings you in with starting sentence. After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger.
24530	9	2	2	The author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading. It's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before, which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'Superman' line. Then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it. It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.
24534	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first. By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place. After that they tell you about the crash course. In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another. Then after they tell you about that, they tell you how unsafe little bits are. Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space.
24536	9	2	2	He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics. Like What Is Space Junk? This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space. Crash Course. This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space. Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage.
24538	9	2	2	He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way.
24545	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.
24546	9	2	2	The article is a well organized piece. It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.
24550	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.
24552	9	2	2	The first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space. Then over the years more satelites were launched, the author is telling you the causes of the space debri. Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things. The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be. The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous. During the last paragraph the author tells the reader that the problem is never ending and ways that corporations could come together to help this problem.
24562	9	2	2	The author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of.  The paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there.  The next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other.  The author gives an example of when one American and Russian satellites ran into each other.  No matter the size of the debris, the speed can cause serious damage.  The conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration.
24563	9	2	2	The author breaks the overall article into sections that introduce the problems, give statistics, and give information on the debris itself. The three main sections are titled 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs. This allows the reader to always know what's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article.
24564	9	2	2	The author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!.  After the attention getter paragraph the author gives background history over the subject in 'What is Space Junk?'.  With the new information over the history the author gives an example of satellites crashing cause alot of space junk.     Then the author explains why the junk is so dangerous by saying 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on spacecraft'.  Then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel.  The author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences.
24566	9	2	2	The author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say. He first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section 'What is  Space Junk?' Then the author tells about the dangers that space junk has on us like with how the satellites crash together. He talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing.
24570	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into sections with titles with an opening paragraph to grab the readers attention. Some of the titles are 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. After the titles the author goes into further detail under each topic title.
24571	9	2	2	He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction, what does it do, and how it happens. 'What is Space Junk?; Crash Course; Little Bits, But a Bing Deal'
24573	9	2	2	The article is divided into an introduction and sub titles called, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', each containing body paragraphs. It ends in a conclussion paragraph.
24577	9	2	2	the author goes through many diiferent paragraphs and sections. For example, One section is called 'What is space junk?' and there are two paragraphs in that section.
24578	9	2	2	From the very beggining the author starts the sentence with a catchy and exciting lead. Then he puts the information into different catagories. The first catagory 'What is space junk?' talks about background unformation such as when the first satellie was launched. Then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past 52 years.          Following that, the next catagory is 'Crash Course' he talks about what could go wrong with satallites. Also, about how America and Russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth. Because of this crash their are Hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now.     The next Category is called 'Little Bits,  But a Big Deal'in these few paragraphs he is basically saying that as much as we would like to think that this isn't a big deal, it actually is. It can even distory spaceships. I think that this is a very organized article. He plans out the paper very well.
24579	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting with an introduction to get the reader intrested.  Then the author explains what exactly is space junk and how it is formed.  The author then explains why space junk is a problem and specific examples on what could happen.
24582	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting off with a fun tone, and then changing up the tone to make it more serious. After the introduction, the author adds some the history involved with satellites and space junk. Then they talk about the satellite collision between the Americans' satellite and the Russians' satellite. Finally, after talking about the collison they talk about what is being done to try to help collect some of the space junk and explaining weither or not space junk is a big deal, or something that really doesn't need much attention.
24585	9	2	2	The author first makes a unique statment saying that a tool bag is floating in space, which leads to the problem of space junk.  Then the author explains what space junk really is and how things become space junk.  After this, actual examples of space junk are given.  The author closes with describing how dangerous space junk is and that people are trying to solve the problem.
24587	9	2	2	The author trys to grab your attention at first. Next he gets right into explaining exactly what the article is about. After that he gives you a few references to some accidents that relate to his topic. Finally he lets you know just how big of a deal the space fragments are even though they're very little.
24589	9	2	2	First off the author gets your attention by simple shocking statements, and makes u wanna read more to grasp what hes talking about.       Next, he explains to us just exactly what space junk is and how it gets there.  He also tells how it is not just something small in space that cant cause damage.     Then, the author explains how it gets dangerous.  He explains how satellites ran into eachotherr and caused hundreds of peices of debris in the air.  He also tells us how an asronaut lost his tool bag in space.     Finally the author describes how tiny fragments can hurt.  Those tiny fragments in space traveling at 5 miles per second can destroy a space shuttle.  That is a big deal.
24592	9	2	2	The author begins the introduction with a hook to catch the reader's attention in the form of a shocking statement. The author then goes into an explanation of what space junk is, and why it poses a threat. Then, he states some startling statistics to explain how dangerous spage junk really is. He concludes with why these issues matter and how people should work to confront them.
24593	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting side heading into the story. The side heading prozide an organized map  for the reader to follow. Sections are clearly separate from one another. The side heading What is Space Junk explains what space junk is and reasons from how it got to where it is. In the side heading Crash Course, the story tells us of crashes in history and gives specific examples.
24594	9	2	2	The author organize his article in sections according to the topic.     'What is Space junk,' 'Crash course,' and etc.
24596	9	2	2	The author organizes the article from catching the reader's attention in the opening paragraph and later lets the reader know what the paragraph is supposed to be about. The paragraph shows the problems with satellietes and this is shown form 'What Is Space Junk' all the way through to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. In order to grab the reader's attention you must try to find a way that helps people be attracted to your work and this author used statements such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'.
24604	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in to different columns stating with an intuduction. These cloumns include 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This makes the article much easier to understand
24605	9	2	2	The author puts Orbiting Junk in to sections to show What Is Space Junk. Talking about what it is. How it comes bout. What the out come is. Crash Course talks about how space junk may interfer with spacecrafts and other object. Litlle Bits, But Big Deal talks about how it does cause a problem for the arstronauts and spacecraft. How tiny debris can be a big deal and cause a mission to fail.
24609	9	2	2	First the author starts with an introduction to get your attention. The author then gives a breif history on 'space junk'. The author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space. The author finishes with telling the reader about objects in space can be very small but still cause massive amounts of damage.
24615	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the reader's attention. In the body of the article the author explains what space junk is, how it got into space, and why the junk stays in space. Then the author gives an account of what happened when two satellites crashed into each other and produces hundreds of smaller satellites. After that the reader is informed of how dangerous microfragments of space junk really are and how different space agencies, such as NASA, are dealing with the issue. In the article's conclusion, the author shares with the reader that the amount of space trash is increasing rapidly and that space agencies hope to work alongside nations and corporations to stop space pollution.
24619	9	2	2	He breaks it down into different topics. The first main section,titled 'What is Space Junk?', is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris. 'Crash Course' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage.
24627	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by seperating it, and breaking it into sections,like 'Orbiting Junk' talks explains what space junk is then tells the reader it is a great concern to the government of space agencies around the globe. then there's 'what Is Space Junk?',which explains whats happen over the past 52 years. Then  'Crash Course', tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother. Then the reader goes to  'Little Bits But a Big Deal', which explains how bits of space debris present a very serious problem, how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the carefully designed spacecraft. The articel being organized  helps the reader stay interested and understand better.
24629	9	2	2	The author categorizes this article. For example, he puts information about space junk in 'What Is Space Junk'.
24631	9	2	2	The author organized this article by making every section have a diferent topic. For example he/she had titles sucha as ' What Is Sapce Junk, Crach Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal'
24632	9	2	2	The author starts off with an exciting introduction, that very much grabbed my attention. Next, he or she defines Space Junk. Third, the author discusses how satellites collide with each other. Lastly, he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal.
24636	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by topic. In the first section, 'What Is Space Junk,' the author basically explains what space junk is and gives a few examples of space junk. The author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section. In the last section, the author explains how even though some debris is very small it still poses a huge problem.
24644	9	2	2	To organize the article, the author breaks up the information into different categories. They have the introduction, then they have a section about space junk, after that there is a section about how the satelites crash, and lastly there is a section about how much of an impact the space junk has on people in space and on earth.
24649	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover. The first topic is all about space junk, while the second is all about the crash course, and the third is about little the space trash.
24650	9	2	2	He starts out telling what space junk is. Then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris. After that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal. He organizes it all by using the headings What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24651	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together. He or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader, then proceeds to lead right into the main idea: space junk. He mentions the objects that have been sent into Eath's atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites, and what happens when it malfunctions. He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk. This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead' satellites cause, and so on. The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage.
24654	9	2	2	The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed. The author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk.
24659	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical from history to present, he/ she lists things for the matters they are in like say crash course they explain that the satilites crash from the course they are on. Then say what is space junk they tell you what space junk is and how it happend way back when. the person lets you know what the sections are about.
24663	9	2	2	The author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is 'now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.' The author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled, 'What IS Space Junk?' The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris. The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris.
24665	9	2	2	The author organizes the article from most important to the least important.  The author goes form 'What is Space Junk' to 'Crash Course' and finally to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  He goes this way because to understand what the reader is talking about, you must first understand what space junk is, and to understand why is it important, you have to know how dangerous space junk is by knowing that the space junk has crashed into and destroyed many spaceships.
24670	9	2	2	The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine. It includes headings with short paragraghes under them. The point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details. They make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
24672	9	2	2	the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article.  The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'
24681	9	2	2	The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective.
24683	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'.
24687	9	2	2	The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
24690	9	2	2	The auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
24692	9	2	2	The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause.
24697	9	2	2	The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope.  Then it gives a brief history of space exploration, and a couple incidents of space debris; including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag.  It then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit.
24699	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination.
24702	9	2	2	He starts out as, describing space junk. Than he goes to crash course, and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch. Than last he talks about space trash. He describes the outter space, with all of the trash floating around in it, from previous astronotes.      He goes into great detail about everything that he talks about, but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it. The author did a really good job of writing this article.
24704	9	2	2	The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first. Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk.
24705	9	2	2	The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem.
24710	9	2	2	The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections. First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. Secondly, he/she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' Crash Course'.Then finally, they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on Earth in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24715	9	2	2	The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention. Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk, and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri.
24716	9	2	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read. The subtopic 'What Is Space Junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is, while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel.
24718	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily, without much confusion. Before he/she goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing, they inform you what space junk is. Then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk, as in satellites crashing together. And they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be, because 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing.'
24720	9	2	2	First, the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched. Then, the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies.
24724	9	2	2	The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot.
24726	9	2	2	The author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections. For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009. In the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario.In another example the author titles a section 'What Is Space Junk?' The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth's atmosphere. Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions.
24728	9	2	2	The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful.
24729	9	2	2	The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space. It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided.
24734	9	2	2	The author starts off the passage with a comical line, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.
24737	9	2	2	The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'
24738	9	2	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.  The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern.  The author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs.  Finally, the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid.
24742	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in multiple sections. they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24749	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into several sections: the intro, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader. Section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites, and section three explains why space junk is a problem.
24751	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by separating it in to different categories. In example, the category 'What is Space Junk?' tells you what 'space junk' is, and how it was created. That is how the author organized the article.
24754	9	2	2	The author organizes this article with subheadings, such as  What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24755	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by grabbing the authors attention with a good introduction. They also separate their article into certain sections so they can talk about the different subjects such as 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But A Big Deal'.
24759	9	2	2	The author starts out getting the readers attention. The author then talks about what space junk is, then how space junk comes to be, and lastly the effects of space junk. Each new topic has its own title to seperate each individual idea or point.
24764	9	2	2	This author uses an attention grabber to start out the article and to lure people in to read it. Next, the author goes into detail about what space junk is. After explaining what space junk is the author tells about how the space junk can come from satellites that can run into each other and cause debris to be released. Lastly the author explains how this space junk can pose a problem in our space.
24767	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in four differnet sections that all come together to make this article.  He starts with the first section of 'Orbiting Junk'.  The author opens with a rhetorical question and then becomes more serious as he finishes the first section.  The second section is 'What Is Space Junk?'.  In this section, he explains what space junk is from 52 years ago until today.  In the third section, 'Crash Course', he describes the dangers of space debris colliding at high spreeds.  The last section, he concludes that small bits of debris can still cause a great amount of damage.
24770	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a particular way. The introduction is written in a way that will catch the attention of the reader. 'What is Space Junk' comes next to provide a small piece of background on space exploration and a simplified version of what space junk is, such as a dead satellite. Then the paragraph ' Crash Course' comes next because the author is explaining what happens when space junk collide with other space junk, creating more space junk. Finally the last paragraph 'Litel Bits, But a Big Deal'. This paragraph emphasizes the enviromental impact this space junk is having on space and the serious damage it can cause. It is also showing that space junk is still increasing and scientists are having a hard time looking for a solution to the space junk problem.
24773	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a very lovely, easy to read way. First he starts it off with a nice introduction of wondering what could possibly be up in that sky of ours, and then we find out its just a tool bag. Then he informs us that there is space junk floating in orbit around our planet. He then lets the reader become familiar with what space junk is and how it gets there. Next he explains how satellites can randomly crash into each other which explains all of the 'space junk' floating around sort of like the climax of the article. The last thing he states is that though the particles may be small that they are orbiting at such great speeds that even though they are so small they still can create much damage.
24779	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into sections.  There is a section explaining what space junk is, there is one about satellites colliding in space, there is also one explaining how even the smallest space junk still causes major problems.  Each one of these sections are then divided into smaller paragraphs.  This helps the reader separate their own thoughts to better understand the article.  The author also mixes interesting comparisons with facts so that the reader will get good information with out also getting bored.
24780	9	2	2	The Author orginizes this by catching your attention in the introduction. Then in the next paragraph it basically explains what exactly space junk is. It tells the past of it and everything. Then in Crash Course the author explains to us what is happening with the satillites that are in space. And in the last paragraph they really emphazie that this really is a big deal, and that the little pieces that we can not detect is really effecting space.
24782	9	2	2	First he grabs interest with a creative, quizical introduction, that despite being playful at first introduces the seriousness of the matter.  Then he introduces Space Junk by informing the reader with examples of how it comes about.  Next he goes into greater detail with the following two paragraphs,  'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  'Crash Course' describes the risks presented by dead satellites.  'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' exposes the risk of tiny space debris then concludes the article restating the negative effects space debris can cause.
24786	9	2	2	The author starts out with an introduction that catches the reader's attention. Throughout the rest of the article, he has three more main points that emphasize different subjects, 'What is space junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author ends with a conclusion that wraps up the article nicely and emphasises the importance of the topic.
24787	9	2	2	The author organizes the aritcle by explaining what space junk is with the section, 'What is Space Junk?'. He then shows what can happen when satellites crash into each other with the section, 'Crash Course'. He shows how little bits of debris are bad by the section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24790	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting off with background information, to saying what can happen if the space junk does collide with another sattelite, to saying how space debri is a huge threat and can create a huge problem.
24796	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention in saying that you might see a toolbag in the sky. He/she then introduces the problem of 'space junk' and says how it is a problem. Next, the author goes into a further explanation of what 'space junk' really is. Next, he/she goes on to talk about how the 'space junk' and satellites can cause large, harmful crashes and collisions in space. Last, the author tries to amaze the readers by describing how excessive force of small objects can cause a big problem.
24799	9	2	2	The author organized the article by the way the sections go with each other. 'What Is Space Junk' can be connected to 'Crash Course', because the tiny things that float above the atmosphere can be considered space junk and can still be on a crash course of something. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' can be connected to both other sections, because they all have to do with the dangers of small or large objects floating through space and becoming a danger to the spacecraft and the astronauts on or in the spacecraft.
24800	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in different sections full of information. He informs us on the harmful effects of Space Junk, and also provides information about the past involving space exploration and how this 'Space Junk' has found itself beyond Earth's atmosphere.
24801	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into multiple sections based on subtopic. There is the introduction, then 'What Is Space Junk', a section about the origin and nature of space junk, then there is 'crash course' a section about sattelite collisions creating microdebris and finally, 'little bits, but a big deal' about the effects of space junk.
24804	9	2	2	The author organizes his paragraphs in specific sections. First he has an introduction which capture the reader's attention. Then he wrote 'what is space junk?' which is a section that gives a history of space travel. After that is the 'Crash Course' which explains the crashing of satellites into debris. Finally, is the 'Little bits, Big deal.' and this is a section about the imporatnce of what he wrote about.
24806	9	2	2	The author starts with a flashy introduction to grab the reader's attention.  The reader then goes on to describe the definition of space junk, in the section 'What Is Space Junk?'  He describes what constitutes space junk in this section of the article.  The author then informs the reader that space junk can collide, and provide danger to the people on Earth as well.  He describes this in 'Crash Course.'  He describes microdebris in 'Little Bits, But A Big Deal.'  He finally concludes in a pessimistic manner, stating that space junk is actually increasing.
24810	9	2	2	"""The author uses many different styles of writing. One of them includes his organization.      The author uses a different style of organization than other authors. He doesn't write in chronological order. He mostly organizes from what's least important to the very important information. The author starts with a shocking statement, then goes on to explain his statements and tell his readers what space junk is. He then talks about the effect space junk can have on other objects in space. And in the end he really starts to talk about what people think about space junk and how dangerous it is.     The author starts with little information; he is defining what space junk is. And then the author gradually starts talking about what space junk does and its importance."""
24813	9	2	2	The article starts out in a comical tone to get the reader's attention and to make the article seem more interesing.      It later goes on to provide specific facts and details about the seriousness and danger of'space junk'. He provides facts about past space exploration projects and satellites that have crashed into each other while moving at high speeds, creating a large amount of  tiny microdebris. Using such facts he tries to get the reader to see the seriousness in the matter of 'space junk'.      In his conclusion, he states that the amount of space trash is on the rise because more countries have undertaken space exploration.
24814	9	2	2	The author organized the article by catching our attion by haveing a startling fact about things up in space.  Then he gave us the background of things that happened in space that had to do with space junk.  After that he talks about the speed of junk and how harmful it really is to our planet if they crash. Then finally he talks about how big of an impact outter space junk has on our saftey here on Earth.
24815	9	2	2	The author combines there the story into sections. The introduction is used to grasp the reader. the next section defines what space junk is. The next section gives examples of it happening. The last section refers to it being a big deal.
24817	9	2	2	The author organizes this peice into different sections to help the reader better understand the importance of space debris. For example the author separates the passage into four different sections with titles at the begining to help the reader better understand it.
24821	9	2	2	First, the author gives a good AGS(Attention Grabbing Statement). Then, the authour talks about how orbital pathways are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions. Next, the author state his/her thesis statement. Also, he/she explain to us what is space junk and give us facts about his topic. Then, he/she have headlines and explain to us what that headline means.
24823	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by introducing the topic, giving an example of when it could occur, and exlpaining the effects of the situation. The first section just explains the topic of the article. The second section gives and example of when space junk was formed and what happened. The third sections just explains what happens when space junk is formed and how is effects different things in the universe.
24824	9	2	2	He organizes the article by subject. For example, 'Crash Course' describes the collision of an American and Russian satellite and a toolbag lost in space. and, 'What is Space Junk' describes how debris from satellites in space is created.
24829	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by letting you know what they are talking about but without giving details, than they give a paragraph titles 'What is space junk?' they than tell you what they are talking about in detail. After you find out what 'space Junk' is than they tell you stories of actual events that have happened in our space. With the title 'Little bits, But a Big Deal'in part of the article is letting you know just because something is small and harmless when you get that going the speed of 'five miles per second' than you can cause some serious damage.
24831	9	2	2	The author breaks the article into four sections.  The first section is the introduction.  In this section the author gives the audience a brief idea of what the article is about also drawing the reader in with, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?'  In the next section, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author tells the audience about how space exploration started and the various objects that have been realeased into our solar system that are considered space junk.  In the next section, 'Crash Course' the author describes how old satelittes that are no longer being controlled can crash into each other and create microdebris.  In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', the author explains how this microdebris travels ar high speeds and can still do damage to space ships and astronauts even though the microdebris is very little. Using this method the author is able to explain the harms of space junk to the audience in the simplest method.
24832	9	2	2	The author organizes the ariticle by using bold faced headers at the beginging of the different sections. The headers are What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, but a Big Deal.
24833	9	2	2	The author basically organizes this article into four main sections. First, there is the introduction. Next is a little bit of history on how these things form. After that it talks about the negative affects these pieces of debris can have. Lastly, it talks about what organizations are doing to try and clean up this space mess.
24834	9	2	2	The author first opens with an introduction that grabs your attention.  He then explains how since the start of space exploration years ago, debris has been caught in space orbits from events such as rocket launchings and satellite collisions.  He talks about different ways that it can make it into orbits, and also the size of the debris and the speed at which it travels.  He then heavily emphassizes the importance and seriousness of the matter, talking about how dangerous the fragments can be.  He concludes with the belief that enough public concern for the build-up of space trash will cause space agencies to begin looking for a solution.
24837	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with first giving us an intresting statement and then introduces the term 'space junk.' Next the author explains just what space junk is and the harmful effects it can have. The author then backs his claim by giving examples from history of previous satellites and other objects that have posed danger to astronauts. Then the author closes with explaining that any size of space junk is a potential danger and lists a few more examples from the past that have occoured and what is being done to help the effort.
24843	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by sections.  He or she has an introduction, a What Is Space Junk section, a Crash Course section, and a Little Bits, But a Big Deal section.  In each section he explains the topic theme of the title in a more clear and better way.
24844	9	2	2	This article is organized into secctions or topics with certain things only talked about in each section. Also in each section it can contain multiple paragraphs, although still speaking roughly about the same idea. Such as in Paragraphs 6 and 7 of, Crash Course. These paragraphs both talk about dead satelites, except paragraph six talks about collisions and paragraph seven talks about the crashes and its effects on the astronauts and their ships.
24849	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first catching your attention with the introduction. Then the author begins to tell you about some history about sattelites. Next the author explains that space junk makes a crash course for spacecraft. Finally the author concludes his or her article by explaining how small debris can cause major damage on spacecraft.
24850	9	2	2	The auther organizes this article in an outline form, giving his thesis, 3 topics (What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little bits, But a Big Deal) and details within the three topics.
24853	9	2	2	The author of the article 'Orbiting Junk', organizes the aticle into subsections based of the specific nature of the information that follows. The sunheading for the section 'What Is Space Junk', gives some background information on past space launches but focuses on the debris left behind when the missions fail living so called 'space junk'. 'Crash Course' describes the collisions that can occur in outer space. Lastly, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' describes just how big of a deal the microdebris is in outer space. At the speed these particles are moving at, they become a hazard to all in their vecinity. The used of these subsections allows the reader to better understand and follow the article 'Orbiting Junk'.
24857	9	2	2	tehy start by talkin about space junk and how it got there.Next they talk about how satellites could crash to earth and last they talk about even if the junk is small it can still do damage.
24862	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking the subjects up and talking about only one subject at a time, other then talking about all tha subjects at once. For instance, when the author talked about 'What Is Space Junk?' the author labled that section as 'What Is Space Junk' and only talked about Space Junk in that section.
24864	9	2	2	He organizes it by first starting off with a bit of humor in the first couple of paragraphs.  But by paragraph 4, the author begins to take a more serious and informative role.  He starts of by defining space junk, then leads into the cause of space junk by telling the main cause of it (satellite crashes), and then finally informs us of the dangers of the pieces left over from these collisions.
24868	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into different topics, to put out specific details that are important. The different topics answer questoins instead of having everything run together.      In the paragraphs 'What Is space Junk', it tells you when they launched the first artificial satellite. These different topics give you important information and is seperated to make us understand easier.
24870	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting different topics within the article that emphasize on a certain area of relation. For examples, the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?' focuses on the explanation of what space junk actually is and how it is created, and the section titled 'Crash Course' focuses on the crash between a Russian and an American satellite in February of 2009, and goes on to explain that satellite crashes are not the only source of space junk.
24876	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first getting the reader interested in the article, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then the author decribes how 'Space Junk' is and created, 'The objects themselves, however. are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth far from elemsnts that would cause them to degrade or burn up.' Followed by some effects the 'space junk' has had, 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 mils per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' Then the author closes the article by getting the reader to think about how the 'space junk' could be handled, 'Scientists are hard-presses for an easy solution to the problem of space junk.'
24878	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into sections to help the reader to better understand what the author's point is. The auther uses 'What is Space Junk?' to explain what the trash in space is. He/she uses 'Crash Course' to give details on how space trash is made. Also, he/she uses 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' to show how space trash is very dangerous to astronauts and satellites.
24879	9	2	2	By placeing diffrent titles in the article. Also by giving reason and supportive information based on the titles. Like Space Junk provides information about the junk in space.
24883	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in an efficient way. He/she begins the article with a phrase similar to what one has heard at least once in their lifetime. He/she makes it easier to relate to and it simplifies a very complex event. The author then discusses the tool bag with a few brief paragraphs about the history of spacecraft. One brief example is that he/she stated that in 2009 one Russian and one American communication satellite collided into each other causing numerous pieces of the satellite to begin orbiting earth once more. After explaining what 'space junk' is and the history of space junk, he/she then discusses how to deal with it and what people are doing to help obtain this recent ordeal for future generations of space travel. Again, he organizes this article efficiently and effectively to where it was incredibly simple to understand and identify with.
24887	9	2	2	The article begins in a catchy tone to grasp the readers attention and allow the reader to ask questions that will soon be answered. What Is Space Junk provides a beif history that aids in explaining how all this floating space junk got realeased into Earth's swhirling orbits. Now that the austhor has explained how and why the machinery came into space, the author provides specific situations like the crashing of American and Russian stalites to state how the main issue of potential damage. Lastley, the author raises awareness of damaging space junk by stating the effects of flying microdebri that could damage expensive space craft.
24892	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by using headings for each section to show the reader what each passage will elaborate. In the section 'Crash Course', the reader is given information on different satellite collisions. In 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', the author examplifies why small pieces of broken satellites pose a big problem for fully-functioning satellites. The reader is able to use his knowledge from 'Crash Course' to comprehend the information given in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The organization is logical, with each section building on the previous one.
24895	9	2	2	This article is organized in sections. The author does this so it is easier to read and is easier to find information. The author has the article in sections of 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The headlines in this article give the reader an idea  of what the following papraghaphs will talk about.      In each of the sections the author gives historical information to support the heading and the topic. In 'What Is Space Junk', the author explains how 'the Soviet Union launched the first artificail satellite'. The author goes on to describe how this had an impact and how this related back to 'What Is Space Junk'.
24904	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first hookin gthe reader with an interesting situation. He or she then goes on to explain what exactly the term 'space junk' is and what it is made up of and how it gets in to space. the nest paragraph of the article is the telling of an actual instance when space junk has presented itself to be a problem. the author gives and exact date and they give the exact situation. the conclusion of the article is an explanation of why space junk is such a problem to be concernd about, they also give the names of companies making an effort to prevent or get rid of space junk. they then go on to explain that space junk is increasing. the author states that space agencies internationlly should work together to get rid of the problem.
24905	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first getting you attention with schocking statements that get you hooked. Next the author explains whats going on, or what the problems is. After that he goes into some detail about how this problem is rasing and that we need to find away to somehow get all the space junk out of space or make a radar that can detect the microdebrus fields so that the space ships will not fly through them and get themselves hurt. Then, the author lets you know that some facts about this space junk, like how fast it travles, or how much damage it could do to a space ship. Aslo at the end they kind of leave you with a little bit of hope about the space junk by saying that maybe soace nations can work together and maybe come up with viable solution to space pollution.
24910	9	2	2	The author firts grabs the readers attention by telling the reader important facts about the problems with satellites in space. The author then tells some information about the space junk and tells about the history of it. 'Space Junk', also talks about how all kinds of different nations put out satellites while they are dead. The author then talks about the satellites colliding into each other and gives some good facts about how people do care about our solar system and that we need to clean it up. The author is also trying to put that we need to be more careful so that we don't have our satellites running into other nations or else we will have more problems for us and the other nations. In the last topic the author talks about how those little peices of satellite can be a big deal for our astronauts. It also has an example about the little pieces about how they can ruin out space crafts. This topic also says something about our military radars and how those pieces of satellite can affect them. The last paragraph the author talks about is the solution in cleaning up the space junk.
24913	9	2	2	The author first puts in a introduction that grabs the readers' attention and make the article worth reading. Then they bring up the main topic of the story and give background information as to what exactly space junk is. The author then provides an example as to how space junk is created and tells just how serious the matter really is.
24916	9	2	2	he does it with titles of what he is going to talk about next. 'Orbiting junk' and/or 'what Is space junk'?
24923	9	2	2	The author divides the article into four sections.  The author first grabs readers' attention with an introduction that simply describes the problem of 'space junk'.  Then the author gives basic history and background information to help the readers better understand the problem.  Finally the author emphasized how serious the problem is with lots of evidences.
24924	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first introducing the reader to space junk alone. After the reader has an idea on what the article is even talking about, the arthur then informs he or she on past problems that arise. By doing this, the author creates a tone of seriousness regarding the article. In the last section, the reader is able to realize the severness and threat that space junk may hold. Also, by making this a known problem, there is a greater chance that more efforts will be set in place to fix it.
24925	9	2	2	He organizes it with having different heading with each topic.  The heading 'What is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' all have different material under each one.
24929	9	2	2	At first he talks about space junk and then he talks about the crash course and last little bites, but a big deal.in the first one what is space junk he talks about how little pieces of junk fall from the rockets and the disabled objects becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.The next one crash of course talks about how the dead satellites run risks of colliding with each other, and then finally the last one little bits,but a big deal talks about the amount of space trash is left in space.
24930	9	2	2	The author organizes the in a manner that is very similar to cause and effect. He first introduces the problem, then explains exactly what it is in the section 'What IS Space Junk'. Just by this heading, one can infer that this section will be about what causes this problem, and the author will give details about the cause. The next section, 'Crash Course', is the section on the effect the junk has, with lines such as 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other.' This 'effect' section is followed up by the solution section of this organization method- 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This section is all about what is being and what can be done to fix the problem. The way the author organizes this article-in a cause and effect manner- allows for the details in the article to be presented in a rational and coherent way.
24933	9	2	2	The author starts out by catching your attention. For example, the reader exclaims, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!'  Once the author has your attention and states the main idea, he or she defines what the problem is, as stated in the title, 'What Is Space Junk?'  After the author defines what it is, he or she goes on to explain why it is bad, followed by a counter-statement titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' that deals with some of the reactions readers may be having after being informed of this information. There, the author also summarizes and concludes the idea.
24936	9	2	2	brakes off the artile by sections like for example What is Space Junk? then its satrts the paragraph.
24938	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by breaking it up into different parts that way the reader can understand better.  The article is not as complex as it could be.  It is broken up into 3 sections talking about different things that could happen in space in each one.  From Space Junk to satellite crashes to talking about trash that can harm space and cause many issues.  These issues could also cause earth to have some problems if they're crashes debris could fall back into earth causing more pollution.
24942	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by breaking it down into smaller more informative sections. The sections make it easy to move between them, and the sections are as read What Is Space Junk,Crash Course and, Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Breaking it down into these small sections make it easy to read bacuse you know that each section is about a new part in the topic.
24943	9	2	2	The author organizes the information in the article by chapters, starting with an introduction. Next there is important information about space explortation and how our satilites get into space. Next there is information about how satilites collide. Finally there is information about how little bits and pieces of satilites become a huge problem for years to come.
24950	9	2	2	The author orgainizes the article in terms of how important each paragraph is to the topic. It started off with a simple introduction to get the reader's attention about how space junk may be dangerous. After that, the auhor shows just how dangerous space junk can be and what can happen if it goes unnoticed. In the final paragraph the author states specifically why it can be so dangerous.
24951	9	2	2	First the author gets your attention by having a good graber. then he tells you some information about space junk so you know what it is. After that the author tells you more information about satellites that crash going more than 20,000 miles per hour. The last thing that the author tells you is how the little bits of satellites and tools can really be dangerous to astraunauts and other spacecraft.
24955	9	2	2	The author does a very good job of organizing this article. They provide a brief history on space junk and how it came to be there, provide an explanation to why it is a problem, and provide some of the concerns that it brings to space travel in three different, organized paragraphs.

Then he gets into asking what Space Junk is and he gives facts about that part of the article. After that the author talks about the Crash Course and what happens there. Proceeding from there he starts talking about how harmful little objects can be for the solar system.     In the section What Is Space Junk?, the author talks about how the first satellite got up in space. What all is up there and so on. It was a very good way to get the reader interested in the authors article.     The section Crash Course, talks about what has happened to the satellites in space. How they have been damaged and why. It was quite interesting and detailed.     In the last section the author talks about how it doesn't matter how big or small a object is the object can still be very dangerous in outer space.     The author knew how to get the article organized and detailed it was a very good article for someone to read.
24964	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into sections with different headlines in a specific order to persuade the reader that 'space junk' has many downsides. The author starts with catching the reader's attention with exciting comments, then asking a question about what is actually being seen. Next, the author define's 'space junk' and the great space invasion. Then, the author informs the reader about satellite crashes in outerspace and how rapidly objects in space travel. Lastly, the author informs the reader about the dangers of 'space junk' and how the amounts are growing because of the rising of commercial space travel.
24965	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three sections called: What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24967	9	2	2	They organize it by the way the paragraphs are labeled. What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, Littel Bits,and But A Big Deal.
24970	9	2	2	He starts with a catchy intro to get the reader hooked. Then he will go into telling how it all got started with the Russan teliscope then the americans joined in. After he went on to say how collisions can happen and make space travel dangerus and harmful too the earth and the astronots. Finaly he finishes by saying the problem will only increase with comercial space flight in the near future.
24972	9	2	2	The author organizes their article by having subtitles. They have the 'Orbiting Junk' which explains that orbiting junk is a concern. They have 'What Is Space Junk?' which states what space junk is and what it does. 'Crash Course' talks about satellites colliding and makind a lot more debris. Then their last subtitle 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is stating that these little debris are a very serious problem and how bad they really are.
24974	9	2	2	He organizes the article by starting it off with an exclaimed statement to gather the readers attention.  Afterwards he talks about how some things that the reader would find unusual in space are actually more common than they think.  Continuing on he gives an official definition of space junk when he finishes giving a background of space exploration.  Then the author talks about the danger of having satellites collide into eacher.  This discussion is soon followed by how even the smallest debri can be harmful to satellites.  Finishing the article of he says how organizations are trying to fix the problem and how this problem may be reduced or completely fixed.
24977	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by the importance of the matter in the article. He starts with the introduction, then moves on to explain what space junk is, without truly giving the reason why it is an issue. He then moves on to explain when the issue first appeared and gives background history of space junk. After that, he moves on to give you the real reasons why space junk is an issue in space exploration. After that, he finishes up reviewing the issue of space junk in the world.
24984	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting this article in a strong way to grab your attention.

He then tries to convince you that space junk is a problem and that even a little bit can have a hue impact.
24985	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by putting ideas into different sections in which they fit in. The opening section is a preview of what the article will be explaining and that it's about space junk, the next section explains what space junk is, the section after that explains the dangers of satellites crashing into one another, and the last section tells how even though much of the debris in space is very small, it's still very dangerous.
24986	9	2	2	The author first starts out the article by using a less serious introduction.  After the issue is addressed, the author goes on to explain and define the issue to help the reader better understand it.  Next, the author goes on to explain how the issue of space junk is harmful and how it is sometimes caused by the collision of two or more satellites.  Finally, the author explains to the reader why this issue is such a big deal and states the fact that although it may not seem like a big deal, many people care about it and the harmful effects it can have.  The last paragraph states how the problem is increasing, and gives the reader a sense of hope that space agencies can help this problem.
24989	9	2	2	He seperates it into different sections, each with a different main topic. For example,while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about how much damage even the smallest peices of space debris can do, 'Crash Course' talks about how the space debris is made.
24990	9	2	2	He organizes the article by breaking down into different sections like What IS Space Junk, Crash Course.
24995	9	2	2	The author first explaines what space junk is. Then, the author explains how space junk is made. Last, the author explains how space junk is harmful to humans and why people care about space junk.
24998	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first starting with the introduction, sencond with the history of the great space invasion, thirdly a definition of space junk, following with how crashed satellites occure, then to end the article the authot explains the importance of space junk and what space agencies intend to do and hope for.
25000	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a fashion in which the introduction is attention grabbing. Then the author moves on to explain what 'space junk' really is. Later, the formation of the space junk is described. Then, more details are given and demonstrates the harmful effects of microdebris in outer space. It is organized in way in which someone with no knowledge of the topic may understand what space junk is and how it is a problem.
25006	9	2	2	The author organizes  the article first with some background information. Then the author Goes to the past to explain how trash has gotten into space. Next he goes on how deadly it is. Then finally he goes onto talk about how there might be a possible solution.
25007	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a way that makes it easier for the reader to follow.  The author puts titles above each different section telling what the following paragraphs are going to be about.  For exapmle, 'Crash Course' is the part of the article that tells about two satellites crashing into each other.
25012	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in subheadings, one about what the junk is, one about how the junk got there, and one about what the junk does to the useful space equipment.
25015	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in sections. Each section has relating information pertaining to it's title. For example, the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?' contains information about the various types of debris that are flying wildly through orbit and how they got there. Another example is the section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' In this section, the author explains that regardless of size, space debris can cause unpresidented damage to spacecrafts.
25016	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in that, the author divide the story into different sections.  For example, the author divides the story into 3 sections, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  By dividing the story, it helps the reader understand the different topics that the author is telling you.
25018	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into sections. You start with the introduction, then there is 'What Is Space Junk?','Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This makes it easier to sort the information, and to find a certain type of imformation faster and with greater ease.
25025	9	2	2	He organizes the article into to different sections about space junk. He starts off with an introduction. He then explains what space junk actually is. Next, he writes about the collision of space junk in outer space. After that he discusses why even if it is in small pieces, space junk can cause big problems. He finishes the article by writing about solutions to the space junk problem.
25026	9	2	2	The auther starts out with an interesting statment 'Grab your telescope!look up in the sky! Its a comet Its a Meteor Its a... tool bag?'this realy grabs your atinchon and macks you want to read more in to the article. then the author gos righit in to exsplaning what Space junk is and the author even gives a good back story to how space junk got started.     the author then goes on to tell of the searyos dangers that this junk poases. in the way the author laes out this article it provids an oranized and thoutfal layout fore the reader.
25029	9	2	2	First he uses an introduction to grab the reader's attention. The pause in the question really does just this. Then he tells about space junk and what space junk is in the section called, What Is Space Junk? He then tells about collisions that have happened including the one in February 2009 that he stated. Finally, he ends it up with statements showing that space junk is a big deal and needs to be fixed. He gives a comparison about dust in wind with the sandblaster. He tells how NASA and others maintain catalogues of known objects. He ends with telling that the problem is increasing and needs to be stopped.
25035	9	2	2	The main point of the article is about orbiting objects but the autor broke it down into three main parts. The first part is describing that 'space junk' is parts of orbiting satellites and things that are no longer functioning. The second part is to show that it is possible for satellites to collide causing even more 'space junk'. The third part is to show how this 'space junk' may not seem like a big deal, but it is and people are beginning to increase space exploration to look for answers.
25037	9	2	2	The author starts by gaining your attention. Making a questionable statement that urges you to read on. He then begins to explain the history of space travel in the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?' He then slowly moves on exaplining the dangers of space junk. He does it in a polite yet demanding manner. Showing that it is an important problem. He puts it into threee sections to make it easier to explain what space junk is and then explain the problems of it.
25039	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by introducing new ideas and then explaining them. In the first paragraph he  or she introduces the word 'space junk'. In the following paragraph the authors explains what space junk is and also tells how these objects circle the globe in an uncontrolled orbit. The next section tells how these objects in an uncontrolled orbit are dangerous.
25040	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with subtitles. He has all the separate information grouped into sections with labels stating what they are about. The introduction is more exciting, and then 'What IS Space Junk' is more formal.
25046	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into how the space junk gets into space. Then, how the space junk can be dangerous because at fast speeds it can be very harmful. Next, the author talks about how even though some of the bits are very small, that is bad because then they can not be detected on a radar. The author the talks about how scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of space junk.
25047	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in four different ways. First, the author starts with extremely exclamitory statements to get you intersted in the first paragraph. Second, the author gives you a history on the great space invasion, then the importance of space junk. Third, the author explains crash courses and the magnitude of crashes in space. Lastely, he concludes what he has explained in the first three ways of discription and wraps up the article.
25053	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with multiple sections. Each section describes the problem of space junk a little more to the reader. The section titles 'What IS Space Junk?' explains that space junk is the debris in spacve that are orbitting Earth, such as broken space capsules, telescopes and satellites. The section called 'Crash Course' explains that sometimes these objects crash into eachother. Because these objects can be traveling at speeds of more than 20,000 miles per hour they break into hundreds of pieces that each assume their own orbitual path. The last section called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' describes how big of a problem space junk is. Because these debris are traveling so quickly they can damage the most carefully designed spacecraft. It also tells the reader that the amount of space junk is increasing creating more of a problem.
25054	9	2	2	The author organizes this article very well. He starts off by getting the reader's attention with rhetorical questions. Then he continues by explaining what space junk is exactly. After that he tells the reader what can happen when satellites are sent up to space. Finally, the author finishes by telling the reader how much of an impact this actually has.
25055	9	2	2	Th author organizes this article into sections. Each section further explains the issue or gives background information. The author gives information on satellities and objects that can get lost in space and the effect it has on space travel.
25061	9	2	2	First the author introduces what space junk is. Then next the author tells about two satellites crashing in the section crash course. Then the author ends with the section, Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
25064	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by different categories, such as: What Is Space Junk? and Crash Course. This makes it easier for the reader to read and identify what they are going to read.
25068	9	2	2	He has titles and then talks about what the title was. They also built off each other. Such as he talks about space junk then some of the ways some of it has gotten to space and what it does up  there.
25069	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a way to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughly and make it easier to understand. The author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag (paragraphs 1 and 2). The author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how 'the human race's great space invasion' started it all (paragraph 4). Next, the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit (paragraph 5). The author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that 'bits of space debris present a very serious problem' because 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft' (paragraph 9). Finally, the author tells how agencies are looking for 'an easy solution to the problem of space junk'. This ends the article by emphasizing the importance of this problem.
25074	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four sections. The first section, 'Orbiting Junk,' acts as an introduction that hooks the readers interest, making them want to read more about space debris and how it occurs. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' goes into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place. The next section, 'Crash Course,' explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisions.The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' relates back all the information about 'space junk' back to the reader, explaining it's signifigance and why the reader should care.
25075	9	2	2	The author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener. It wasn't something i expected, but obviously something i needed to know, since it is currently a concern to government space agencies.     The second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is. It tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above Earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely. Now, once this piece of high-teck space object 'dies' it become one more piece of junk added to space, which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner.     Then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another. The effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space. But those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere, any object that are released into space become free-orbiting satellites. So are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open.     The last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem. Those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second! That is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there, if one of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easily go strait through it, or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult. Never fear though, scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris, and they ended up just giving them different code names, and keeping a radar on them at all times, that way they know the safety zones for whats good, and whats bad.
25077	9	2	2	He starts with a grabber then he explains what space junk is. Then he talk about what happened in 2009, Then finally starts talking about the little bits of trash in space.
25079	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting out by stating the problem and then moving on to the specific sections that describe different issues, such as, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' (Orbiting Junk).
25081	9	2	2	The author first starts out with an introduction which informs us of what the article is about. The author then goes in to a sublevel which tells us of what space junk is. The author says that it is stuff that is lost in space and becomes a free roaming satellite. The author then goes into a different sublevel called crash course. This warns us of what could happen when the space junk gets released. The last sublevel is called little bits, but a big deal. This sublevel tells us that space junk is quite small but it is very dangerous because it flies at a rate of 5 miles per second.
25084	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a understandable way. He has the title 'Orbiting Junk' which tells the reader that overall idea. Then he has subtitles for when hes changing the matter of deatials on space junk. For example his first subtitle is 'What Is Space Junk?' In that passage he explains throughly to the reader what space junk is. He also stays on topic. For each section he writes about he dosen't get off topic he stays specific about what he writes about.
25087	9	2	2	First the author has an interesting introduction that really grabs a readers attention. Next, the author describes what exactly is being talked about. Then the problems that the space junk form is talked about and previous incidents that have happened. The last paragraph shows the reasons why it is important and how it is dangerous.
25092	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by placing information under a title of a section that applies to what is in the section. For example, in the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', he tells you what space junk is and how it is formed or created.
25096	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with first an attention grabber.  Such as, 'Grab you telescope'! 'Look up in the sky'! 'It's a comet'! 'It's a meteor'! Then the author gets a more serious tone because he is trying to make a point and let you know how dangerous 'space junk' is. After this, the author lets you know what space junk is. And what a crash course is. Then he says that little bits can be a big deal and explains why. And last, he ends it with all of it is a serious problem.
25099	9	2	2	The author organized the article by putting headings for the different sections to give a better idea about what that paragraph or paragraphs are going to be about. Just as the author puts 'What is Space Junk?' & 'Crash Course' which gives brief descriptions about each paragraph.
25100	9	2	2	The author uses sub topics, or titles if you will, for many of his paragraphs. These titles let you know what the following paragraph(s) are about. For example, 'Crash Course' lets you know that you wil probably be reading about satellite collisions. The author does this through out the article.By doing so, he effective organizes his article.
25101	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by sectioning it off into subcatagories such as 'Crash Course' or 'LittleBits, But a Big Deal.'
25102	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by similar information together. After the introduction, the author uses a historical timeline of the space race to give the reader information about how we got there. Then the author discusses how satellites can become space junk. The author concludes by discussing how the little bits of space trash can be harmful to our space research.
25104	9	2	2	First he grabs your attention with a exclammatory statement, then proceeds to explain the main idea of the passage and tells you a little about satellites. After he explains the main idea, he goes a little more in depth, and tells you what the problem is with having dead satellites in space. Lastly, he explains that even the smallest space debris can pose a very serious hazard to a person.
25105	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by putting different titles and sections when he is discussing a new topic. Like he put 'What is Space Junk?' to tell us more about what this term is and then he made a new paragraph 'Crash Course' so that he could explain what this 'space junk' is doing to us, and what is happening around us. I think that it was good he put it into different sections becasue it makes it less confusing and it helps us understand  the different parts of the story better.
25109	9	2	2	The author organize the article in order. First he made the introduction appealing by writing 'It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a tool bag?' to get the readers attention of what space junk is. After he explain what space junk is, by telling how all started. Then he explain how the satellites collide with each other. And finally he explain the problems space junk causes to space craft and how are countries trying to fix the problem.
25110	9	2	2	The author started the article with an attention grabber to spark some interest for the readers. They then wrote about the last few decades of space exploration to help the reader understand how often and how much we as a species clutter outer space. Finaly the author talks about how much damge this 'space junk' can cause to better our understanding of what the consequences are of satalite crashes or other accidents in space.
25114	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by beginning with a few questions that may seem humorous in order to set a tone of interest in the reader as they begin reading the article. The author then proceeds to change the tone for he rest of the article to assume a more serious demeanor since he wants to create emphasis on the danger of the topic.     The author, after the introduction, begins by defining what space junk is and how it occurs- providing strictly fact or background information on space junk in order to provide an idea about what the article is basically about and to give the reader a rudementary understanding of the subject before the reader is subject to more information or opinions on the subject.     The author can then go more deeply into the effects of space junk and who is monitoring it and how it can be harmful to future space exploration.
25115	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by using subheadings to talk about different subjects in the same topic. For example one of the subheadings is called 'What Is space junk?' in that section he talks about the type of objects circling around space. In the subheading 'Crash Course he talks about satellites crashing. They talk about the same topic which is relating to space junk but different subjects like how satellites crash.
25119	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into groups of paragraphs using bolded words, such as 'What Is Space Junk?', or 'Crash Course.'
25121	9	2	2	The article starts out with a catchy introductionby telling readers to 'Grab your telescope!' The second paragraph goes right into defining what 'space junk' is and how it is harmful. It then talks about how satellite crashed can create debris. The article goes on to talk about the fact that the debris created cannot be detected if it is smaller than a baseball. This means that it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of the debris. The author discribes this as grains of sand being shots from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.
25123	9	2	2	He starts out by explaining a small portion of the problem. The author then goes in to describe what space junk is defined as so there is a better understanding of the problem. The author goes on to state that all satellites will eventually crash into some kind of object at some point and how big of an issue it really is. Then the author describes that even though the pieces may be really small there is still a large possibility that it can damage the satellite and spacecraft.
25126	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by explaining what is in space, then going further in deatil and explaining history of space pollution and how it gets there, then finally explains how just small pieces can cause damage forever. The author went through that order to make it more understandable and to emphasize the problem to the reader.
25127	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by topics. The autor will start a new section by adding a title to inform the reader what it will be about. The article on Crash Course is simply explaining the number of collisions made every year in space.
25131	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by making titles for each section.  For example, when the author talks about how space junk can crash into other objects in space, the title for that section is 'Crash Course.'  The author also starts off explaining what space junk is, then moves on to tell the reader how it is dangerous, and explains how big of deal it really is at teh end of the article.
25133	9	2	2	The article starts with an introduction, then explains what space junk is, how it happens, and why it is important to know about.
25137	9	2	2	Throughout the article, the author organizes each section by the general time of the action. After the beginning, when the autor captivates the attention of the reader, the author begins to tell the reader about the first launching of space satellites, and the particular elements of space science. The author then begins to write about the relevance of space debris to now, followed by any solutions that have been brought up in the past years.
25138	9	2	2	The author divides the article in to 4 sections. First is draw the attention of the reader us. The second section is to identify what Space junk is and what the article is about. The next section is about how satilites crash and what happens after the problem occurs. Last he exsplains why the problem is a serous matter and what scientists are doing to fix the problem.
25139	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by going in order of importance, or relevant information. The author first explains what space junk is by giving the reader a brief overview of the definition and history of spacejunk. Next, the author discusses how space junk can come about, explaining that dead satellites may ultimately mulitply into a mass amount of space junk if said satellite crashes into another dead satellite. Finally, the author stresses the importance of the dangers of space junk, stating that any microdebris smaller than the size of a baseball can go undetected. This undected microdebris may pose as a serious threat to space travelers because the microdebris may cause harm to the spacecraft.
25140	9	2	2	The author starts by making a simple statement. Than he explains what 'Space junk' is and how it cause our Earth many problems. In the third sections, the author explains crash course, which is uncontroled satellites that collide with each other causing pieces of debris to fly through space.In his final section, he explains that even though the problem is small its still a big deal. The paragraph explains a small fragment travling at the speed of five miles per second can cause serious damage.Which is followed by the auther saying that the problem is increasing.The whole article explains and show more information to us to better understand.
25147	9	2	2	The author organizes his information by organizing it by the topic or incident it pertains too. For example, they sort all the information about the satellites' collision of 2009  into a paragraph titled 'Crash Course.' Also, they title the paragraph telling the reader exactly what this cosmic debris is in a paragraph title 'What is Space Junk?'
25149	9	2	2	First the author grabs our attention with his first statements by acting as if he's telling you to look in the sky. Next He uses one paragraph to sum up just the topic of his article. After his one paragraph he decides to tell you more information by organized sections. The first section tells you what space junk is so you can know what he means when talking. After you have realized what space junk is he goes on to give a example on what can happen with space junk. When he trys to tell you of how small things at a fast pace can be dangerous he tell you about that in the next article. Basically the author uses two beginning statements, one paragraph, and 3 sections to explain and organize his concerns on space junk.
25152	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in such a way that answers a question that a reader may have once they gain new information in the previous section or paragraph. For instance, in the introduction, we learn the term 'space junk.' The next section of the article is titled 'What is Space Junk?' The next title, 'Crash Course,' helps to show what has caused this issue of space junk. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' addresses any doubts that the reader may have about space junk being a true issue. This organization makes the article easy for the reader to read and comprehend.
25158	9	2	2	The author organizes the article very clearly.  The author seperates the article into pieces and gives a titles for all of the new topics.  The author is generally just trying to get the reader to understand the meaning of 'Orbiting Junk'.
25159	9	2	2	The author starts with a simple introduction that begins to lead the reader into the article. After the introduction, the author begins explaining what space junk is in case the reader does not know. The author wants to make sure the reader understands the term, and knows what he is referencing to. The the author gets into describing how dangerous space junk can be. He or she explains how satellites have 'the risk of colliding with each other.' The author also tells of the dangers of the small debris that results from the collision. He or she tells the reader of how these tiny fragments can result in serious damage. And in the end of the article the author emphasizes that the problem is becoming worse and that space agencies hope to solve the problem soon, but haven't come up with a solution yet.
25160	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three different subtopics that all have something to do with the main topic of the article.

As a reader if the author did not use these sub-headings, the article would have made very little sense and seem very disorganized. Because the author used the progression of thought and subtitles, it was very organized and easy to follow. This is why the author organized the article by topic.
25202	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into four sections. The first section, 'Orbiting Junk', grabs the reader's attention and explains how 'space junk' is a concern in goverment space agencies. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', explains how spacecrafts in the atmosphere can result in junk that begin to circle Earth in an uncontrolled orbit. 'Crash Course' explains why governments are concerned with the debris by illustrating a crash between satellites. The conclusion, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', explains that the problem is only increasing and space agencies are trying desperately to end the space pollution and damage.
25204	9	2	2	He organizes the article in a way to make it easier for the reader to read. The way he has a name for each section like 'What is Space junk?' and 'Crash Course'. It just makes it easier to follow.
25205	9	2	2	They begin the article with a catching introduction, drawing the reader to the article with a humourous quote. They add a twist to the quote: 'It's a . . . tool bag?'. This is to foreshadow the story of the accident in which a toolbag escaped the grip of an astronaut during a repair on the Internation Space Station. The author proceeds to explain what 'space junk' is, and how much of it is formed. The article explains the dangers of dead satellites that can crash into each other. It explains that with the increase of space exploration, there will be a collective increase of space junk. The author says that many people care about the space junk, offering opposition to readers who are indifferent to this issue. The author concludes that space agencies should work together to find a solution to this important problem.
25207	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by separating different information into different sections. For example one section labeled 'What Is Space Junk?' only talks about what space junk is, and explains the history of space junk.
25212	9	2	2	The author starts the article with a phrase that might be said by a normal person and grabs their attention by saying something not expected when they say its a tool bag. This first paragraph states what this is. The next paragraph then explains what the space junk is and how it came about. The paragraph says this when it explains the great space invasion. Then the section crash course explains the crashing of orbiting satellites  and other orbiting junk such as a tool bag. The last section explains how the junk is a big deal when it says the debris from the space junk can cause holes in the space ships we design.
25214	9	2	2	First, the author uses unusual statements to grab the readers attetion. There is no way that anyone would expect a tool bad to be in the sky. Then the author gives some facts about space exploration and explains what space junk is. After that the author gives a specific anecdote about how an American and Russian satellite crashed. This crash caused much debris and poses a huge fdanger to any future space travel. Finally, the author explains how even very small space debris can be very dangerous to carefully designed spacecrafts.
25217	9	2	2	The author first states and observation found in space, and then he tells you what it is and explains space junk. Next, he tells you what this space junk can cause. Then, he tells you why these little things are big deals and what they harm in space.
25219	9	2	2	This article is organized by topics. in the beginning its exciting to catch readers attention, and then it goes on to a more serious mood.it tells you what 'space junk' is,then tells you why it is important and dangerous. after that it tells you about satellites and why they are a problem.after that, it talks about the size of the trash and the dangers of the speeds.
25221	9	2	2	The author of Orbiting Junk organizes the article by topics. These topics include, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.

It's organized as an informal persuading article overall.
25248	9	2	2	He uses them in order on which questions would apear. If someone doesn't know why a tool bag would be in space, or wants to know what space junk is, the auther tells them right off the bat. The auther talks about how they collied and make smaller pieces, which explains the Crash Course paragraph. It then talks about the little pieces that break off, which is the purpose for Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Each paragraph has a purpose and they are all in order.
25250	9	2	2	He orginizes the passage by first introducing what it is then moves each part into detail about a particular object. for example it starts by asking what is space junk? and telling us all about it, then it goes into what causes it or as it is called crash course, and last he tells how he feels about all the space junk in the last paragraphs called little bits, but a big deal.
25251	9	2	2	He organizes it into several sections. Each section being about its own topic. One being about collisions and how space debris appears. Another being the potentioal problem that it could inflict. Then another about the hisory of space exploration.

25253	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving a good start in the beggining. Starting off eith an retorical question and then following with a serious manner problem. The author then explains what apce junk is and how dangerous it can be. Then it continues with the dangerourous crashes in space. Crashes then create harmfull debris. Then at the end explaining that little bits are big deal to the earth.
25255	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first talking about all of the space parts that are orbiting around the earth to help the reader better understand how many things are in space.  Next the author describes how dangerous leaving 'high-tech junk' in space can be.  The author gives an example of the emphasis put on the strength of this debris by saying ' instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.  The author continues on by trying to keep the reader interested in how much of a problem the microsatellites can be in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  The author finishes by saying the problem is still increasing instead of being fixed.

He explains how the junk comes to be and what happens to it. He also gives information on how space junk comes to be. It is caused when sattelites break or run into eachother.      Lastly, he describes the bad effects space junk have. He says all of the upcoming space exploration is increasing the amount of space junk which is cluttering the atomsphere. He says the new amounts is making space travel more difficult and everyone needs to work together to limit the amounts.
25258	9	2	2	The author of this article organized his work into sections. He began with in introduction to help introduce the problem and catch the readers attention. Then he explained the basic history of what we have in our orbital in the section called 'What Is Space Junk.' Through 'Crash Course,' the author explained what the space junk does that makes it a problem to any space program. Finally he wraps up with his conclusion and explains how it effects us as a community and a planet.
25261	9	2	2	The author organizes in different subsections that he or she believes fit together. I like this idea because sections like 'Crash Course' can easily be identified as the section where collisions are found.
25262	9	2	2	The author organized this story into different sections. The author first gets our attention with the introductions. The author then gives us some background information on the history of space junk and how it can effect the earth. Next, we find out how harmful this space junk really is. It talks about the collisions of satellites and how they are harmful to earth. Finally the author tells us that once they have collided they are formed into little bits that are still a big deal. It is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of this tiny object.
25263	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in little sections to highlight each thing you need to know about Space Junk. Like the first section what is space junk, the author explains what Space Junk is and where it comes from. The Crash Course section talked about two satellites colliding into each other.

25266	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a very good way. The introduction is first. Next, we find out what 'Space Junk' actually is. Then, It talks about how it is made when satellites collide and crash which causes it to form into smaller pices because everything breaks apart at very fast speeds.
25270	9	2	2	THE AUTHOR ORGANIZE THE ARTICLE BY BREAKING EACH OF THE THING HE WANT TO TLAK ABOUT INTO THREE LITTLE SECTION. LIKE THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE JUNK THE BE IN SPACE AND THE SECOND IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CRASH WHY YOU IN SPACE IF YOU DONT HAVE ALL CONTROL OF YOUR SPACESHIP. AND THE LAST ONE JUST TALKS ABOUT LILTTLE THINGS THAT CAN FALL FROM SPCAE AND SOME PEOPLE DONT THINK THAT ITS A BIG DEAL BUT IT IS.

And then the author transitions into a related topic, tiny bits of space trash. The author talks about the dangers of even a small bit of space debris. The author concludes by talking about the current state of the problem of space junk and intiatives to try and solve the problem of space junk. Throughout the entire story, it is a progression. Setting the story up, defining terms and talking about how they are formed, what role they play, what damage they can do, and finally ways to stop the problem.
25276	9	2	2	The author starts with a catchy introduction that is an allusion to a common phrase from 'Superman.' He/she continues on with explaining in general what space junk is, and how some of it got into space. 'Crash Course,' the next section of the article, explains in more detail of two incidents in space that created space debris, a crash and a dropped tool box. Finally, the last few paragraphs explain why the little peices of space debris have such an impact due to the high speeds at which they travel. It also mentions why we should be concerened and how this problem, if not solved quickly, will become an even larger issue due to more and more space travel in the near future.
25277	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by introducing the concept of space junk in a fun way but quickly gets serious as the articles pass. He explains space junk by reviewing the space age, then getting to the matter at hand.

25296	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first trying to get the reader's attention. He proclaims things such as 'Grab your telescope!' Then, the author begins to define how objects released in space will always orbit the planet, even after they have malfunctioned. This creates a 'great concern to government space agencies around the globe'. The author then addresses the topic of how space debris is created. for example when 'two communications satellites...both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour' crashed, they produced hundreds of pieces of debris. Next, the author informs the reader of how these tiny pieces can be very harmful and dangerous. In addition to the danger they pose, 'the problem is certain to persist.' Last, the author includes facts on how this issue will worsen.
25298	9	2	2	The author first grabs the reader's attention by using a line from a Superman quote. He/she then turns into serious mode and talks about space explorations and how objects can be detached from an exploration.

The author concludes the article by talking about what scientists can do to prevent space junk in the future.
25300	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four sections: The introduction, which introduces the reader to space junk with an anecdotal occurence, 'What Is Space Junk?', which describes countless objects orbiting the Earth, 'Crash Course', which descibes the events of satellites and other orbiting objects crashing into eachother, and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains how serious space junk is, and what problems it can cause.
25303	9	2	2	The article is organized by certain topics. Each paragraph is about something specific. For example, the 'Crash Course' paragraph is mainly about collisons of the 'space junk.' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how smaller debris, moving at a high speed, can still cause a lot of damage.
25305	9	2	2	"""The article follows cause-and-effect organizational pattern.  From the prelude in the introduction, it moves onto a description of the history of space travel; furthermore, it descbribes how a celestial satellite becomes 'space junk.'  In the last part of the article, entitled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' it explains how the microscopic pieces of loose material up in space can become a dangerous problem to travelling satellites.  From the cause of space pollution to the effect of dangerous environments in space travel, the organization helps to understand the nature of the problem at hand.  Furthermore, the article is divided into labeled sections describing the common themes for the compilations."""
