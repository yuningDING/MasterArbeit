14001	6	3	3	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.
14014	6	3	3	One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane. The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane.
14163	6	3	3	Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane. Active Transport is a process used where the cell uses energy and transport proteins to move substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane. And finally, passive transport requires no energy and moves with the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane via transport proteins.
14236	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.
14261	6	3	3	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
14270	6	3	3	Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell. Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave. Passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it, and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium, or vice versa.
14285	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.
14307	6	3	3	These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
14367	6	3	3	The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient
14426	6	3	3	Active transport- uses energy to move subatances across the membranePassive transport- does not use energy to move substances across the membraneOsmosis- the diffusion of water across the membrane
14439	6	3	3	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.
14473	6	3	3	active transport- active transport is when a cell uses energy to transport substances across the cell membranepassive transport- passive transport is when a cell transports materials across the cell membrane without the use of energyosmosis- osmosis is the transport of substances through the semi-permeable membrane (water)
14485	6	3	3	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.
14561	6	3	3	1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2. Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules can't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3. Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
14581	6	3	3	Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.
14610	6	3	3	Osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membrane.An active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient. Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this. It takes more energy than a passive transport.A passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane. A passive transport uses little or no energy.
14633	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.
14680	6	3	3	Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane. Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
14710	6	3	3	Active Transport-This is the transport of something when energy is neededPassive Transport-This is the transport of something without using energyDiffusion-This is the natural movement of a higher concntration to a lower concentration.
14759	6	3	3	Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.
14816	6	3	3	Osmosis. The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport. The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient.
14905	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.
14911	6	3	3	DIFFFUSION, or the spontaneous movement of a substance from a high concentration to a low concentration zone;FACILITATED DIFFUSION, or when diffusion occurs through special protein channels located in the cell membrane;ACTIVE TRANSPORT, meaning that the cell invests ATP in order to transport substances in or out of the cell up the concentration gradient by special protein pumps.
14975	6	3	3	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.
15030	6	3	3	Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))
15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.
15068	6	3	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.
15101	6	3	3	Osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membrane.Active transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cell.Passive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy.
15211	6	3	3	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.
15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.
15254	6	3	3	cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane
15267	6	3	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.
15306	6	3	3	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.

15747	6	3	3	The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.
15762	6	3	3	Osmosis is when water moves across the membrane.Active transport is when energy is needed to move the substance across the membrane.Passive transport is when no energy is needed.For bigger particals, a protein is used.The cell can also surround a partical and absorbe it. It is the oppisite for removing a partical.
15828	6	3	3	Materials move into the cell through Passive transport, active transport, diffusion, and ossmosis. Passive transport doesn't require the cell to exert energy, but active transport does. Difusion is simply the movement of substances into and out of the cell. Ossmosis involves diffusion by use of water.

Diffusion allows materials to flow from where there are higher concentrations of that substance to where there are lower concentrations of that same substance.Another process is active transport.  It allows a cell to control exactly which materials enter or leave the cell, but it also expends energy.Another process is the use of protein channels.  These allow only one specific type of molecule to enter of leave through that  channel.  These distributed across the cell membrane allow the cell to control what enters or leaves.

This is where larger particles are moved in and out of the cell through the membrane.  This process uses energy.
16225	6	3	3	Since a cells membrane is semi-permiable there are multiple ways for substances to enter the cell. The First is osmosis. Osmosis allows water to enter or leave the cell depending on the need. The second is Diffusion. Diffusion takes all substances other than water across the membrane, moving from area of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The third way is through facilitated diffusion. The cell pulls substances across the membrane that would otherwise be to large.
