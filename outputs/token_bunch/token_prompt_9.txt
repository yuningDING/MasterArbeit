They explained what space debris is so important and why such small pieces are such a big impact. 
400042635	9	0	0	Next he says what space junk is. Which i think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my atttention expecially in the introduction. He concludes that small bits of microdebris can cause.

In the section 'little bits, but instead give us information and connect them again at the end of the article. For example, the author wants to support the nasa because that is very important. In fact, the author then uses two sections to explain space junk. The author tells about the microdebris in space. Eventually, the call to action being that space agencies are trying to fix the problem.

Then, the author gets the attention of the reader. He states how we first started adding space junk and little bits, but that made me interested in reading it. Then he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space debris. Then he goes into great detail about everything that he talked about include, what does it do, as it is called crash course, which is used to explain a situation about how a tool bag. Then tells a little about satellites. Then the author talks about the launching of the junk in space and how many countries are trying to find ways to get rid of space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space there are 33442 satellites.

The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them. The first one, entitled 'what is space junk? , crash course, then little bits, but a big deal. Breaking it down into things of importance. To begin, after they have the reader's attention from their introduction, they explain what the space junk does, and how it got there. It talks about the danger of microdebris in space.

The author of this article organized the paper logically. First, the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why satellites can be considered space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve the probelm, and prevent damage from space debris. 
500043378	9	0	0	Thing the author talked about 'what is space junk? '.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.

'  in this section, one may be confused as to what the author is tring to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, then changes to a section devoted to specifically explain what space junk is. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This creates a 'great concern to government space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on earth in 'little bits, but a big deal. The paragraph says this when it explains the great space invasion and how high tech junk circles the globe in orbit. Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention. Next, the author also organizes the first section with 'the disabled object becomes a pieces of high000tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'crash course' paragraph and so on. He has headings such as what is space junk? '.  Then in the third paragraph, the reader also learns some background information, further explanation of risk, and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done to try to help collect some of the space junk and how 'the human race's

In this airless environment, some of them continue to circle the planet indefinitely. While this is ideal for a fully functioning object that was launched for that purpose for example, a communications satellite what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired? ' of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high000tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, crash course, etc. The did a really good job organizing the article in this way the author has made it easier for the reader t fully understand the author's veiwpoint on the matter, and also gets into better detail.
