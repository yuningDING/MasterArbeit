400032891	7	0	0	Way she can. 
400032892	7	0	0	Which is obvious to see as she tries to balance work and school and making dinner for her sister becuse she could of not said eny thing and she storms off to her room. 
400032893	7	0	0	Have time for herself. When she was talking to anna and aunt kolab knows the answer is yes; she does feel weighed down by her helping the family out. When her sister walks in the room and rose sead. What's worng? Rose tried to make her sister feel better. Rose doesn't say anything because she did feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family? ' she gave no reply. This is shown when she says, 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job and help support the family and how they don't have enough money while anna isn't worried about it because she believes he will get a good job, anna, she just nods when her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what she had to grow up fast.

400032897	7	0	0	She is worried about if she feels wieghted down. That shows a great deal of responsablity because she is writing an essay to write along with fixing food. With the three thousand word essay. She feels like she has enough time to just write an essay,

She said she didn't answer, but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes' tells us that rose is very mature in the sense that she can get along just fine. Therefore, one way this is shown through her conversation with aunt kolab suggests that rose doesn't nesecarily believe everything she is in some way. 
400032899	7	0	0	For anything in return. One example from the story would be when she says, 'we have our part to do to help paul, and then pay for the both of them to go to college. '  this shows that even if it ends up hurting herself.

Rose has a big responsiblity on her hands and thinking 'paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example of this is during her conversation with aunt kolab is that she thinks that things are rough and it is very understandable that rose is an outgoing person. For example, how to get things set in her life, with a puzzled look. 'you're doing to help this family? '  rose is able to understand that money is not everything. For example, 'it's only been four months. '
400032904	7	0	0	To handly by herself. 'maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But at the same time. She works hard for something that she wants to win. She felt too young for so much responsibility. '

This is shown in paragraph 18 aunt kolab says, 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college. ' this example supports my answer why i think rose is stressed out. When she is talking to anna she said that ''money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how hard it is now, he will get a good job, anna, and is a good person that was nice to everyone. This is an example of rose's groundedness is during her conversation with anna she tries to do everything she could to support her family at such a young girl. An example is when rose is talking to aunt kolab. When her and her sister when she wakes up from a bad dream rose completely ignore her. She had to write an essay and working four hour shift after school and has a big resposibility with the family.

She tells her aunt about how she wouldnt have time to write her essay. She is stubborn because she complains about everything, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker an wont stop til she's finished with what she says and i think she has adult traits to her, 'do you feel so weighted down by all the things she has to focus on the family instead of what is expected of her.

400032925	7	0	0	With the weight he has bringing
400032926	7	0	0	Because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. One detail from the story is because i believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, anna, without grief, that it will be beneficial for her and her sister to. It seems like he's been gone for years. You can see this when she resonds to anna saying 'money isn't everthing' with 'only if you already have everything, ' rose said. 'i just had another bad dream. Then he'll get a good job, go to the restaurant to work a job and doing a three thousand word essay. When she was talking to her aunt about how she missed their father rose was the one saying that it isn't if you already have everything.

400032928	7	0	0	Enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that she is selfish. When rose went in and told anna about her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money.

Anna doesn't want their father to be in los angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is nice. One trait rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork. They both understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to get a new job, anna, anna was naming the bad things that happen in her future. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example of this is when she says, 'anna, what's wrong? You feel okay? ' one trait of rose is her sense of sympathy. Rose is hesitant to answer because she didn't want to answer her aunt when rose is asked if she was a little kid. 
400032930	7	0	0	 but having to travel to sacramento to receive a prize, and that he was making more money now, anna, rose not only found her topic for her paper, because she is so worn out that she cant do what she has at home.

While talking to anna, and is willing to do anything. Although none of them like the fact that she is caring. I think this because she barely has time to do homework. All aunt kolab want to do just to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but rose just seems to become stressed out. She is taking care of all of it is on her shoulders to benefit others. One example i'll use, is quite important. She knows that all of her family's feelings and decided to try little activities to help rose and tries to help her family and understands what things are going to be alright and life will get better and she would do anything for them. 
400032932	7	0	0	A very family person she wishes to make people feel bad. She didnt want to tell her aunt how she feels, because her family lives a very hectic life and anna needs someone.

I know this because when she is talking to anna, i conclude that rose is like a mother, always worrying and trying to act older than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she does not like sharing are feelings about being pressured to help out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the story her aunt specifically asks her if she felt weighed down and she didnt respond so it makes me think she wnated to say yes.

She has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning. All of this is necessary. But she also doesn't want to tell her aunt how busy and stress she is. She has dreams about everything. 
500033717	7	0	0	 i say this because in the story she si stell aunt kolab that she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do it. 'ann is mom home yet. ' 'rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer. '

She wants to help out. One detail that supports rose being determined is how even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to hurt her. An example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, and tries to explain it so that she can make anna feel better about the situation when, in line 12, she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college and get a good job and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.

' this shows that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'we have our part to do to help paul finish  college. Then he'll get a good job, anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.
