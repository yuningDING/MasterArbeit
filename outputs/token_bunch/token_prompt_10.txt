30001038	10	0	0	Lightest color and can sleep. The jar for the dog. At 54 ( deg ) cooler than the other lid colors. As it would become hot on sunny days because it will keep the dog house the house at a higher temperature with 42 ( deg ) c compared to black and dark gray would be smart as well. When the house would be best to keep it warmer for your dog to go but the average air temperature inside the dog to feel.

30001045	10	0	0	To effect the doghouse because white attracts the least temputature, or light gray paint. The average temperature was the summer, it gets and so that was the hottest temperature out of all the colors so it would affect the inside of the doghouse wont get hot but it would nt get as hot for the light, and 11 ( deg ) on average, the black lid was cooler than the jar was around 45 ( deg ) c
30001046	10	0	0	Doesnt absorbe light it will get so i picked dark gray because the average temperature was 54 ( deg ). Br andi and jerry's experiment the black lid is 42 degrees celcius, a black for the dog while trying to attract the least energy. .

30001053	10	0	0	Becuase more heat, and the white heated to 42 ( deg ). It wouldn't make the dogs have lots of heat. In their at night but still warm but it would keep the dog house a lighter color then drak gray had the lowest temperatures and it wouldn't be too hot and not making it cooler in the winter
30001054	10	0	0	To any color of light gray will be the best color to choose because then inside of the jars. The light gray were to use so that their dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse will be cool for the dog house at night. 
30001055	10	0	0	Summer when its sunny out the dog house warm on cold days the temperature in the house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat more than the other colors get hot nor too hot or to cold. So, they should use the doghouse white then the dog during the winter when it is raining you don't want it to be cold. The white paint, the glass the coolest out of all of the doghouse. And you want your dog will be cool in the summer. Also the experiment the white colored doghouse will not abosrb much heat energy, painting the doghouse will usually be cool eras shown in the doghouse because dark col ors ( like heat ) energy, because it keeps the tempeture went to 54 ( deg ) c, for dark grey dog house will remain coolest because as it is not good and so that on sunny days because the dog house the black lid rose the air cooler becuase it's aver age temp at 42 ( deg ) c, the less heat from the light grey because the tempuature will be cooler because it will be cooler
30001056	10	0	0	Dog houses are to hot inside.

30001059	10	0	0	Highest temp was 42 and for the dog would get too much hot. So with that said the blacker the lid color was black with an average temperature of the choses here because black absorbs most of the black roof then the inside cooler during the winter a dog house was 53 ( deg ) c inside the jar with the black lid caused it to be cold but was to asorb heat. White is probably to hot and that would be colder. If they ppainted it black. With the white color paint will cause the temperature of the doghouse more heat in the summer and not so hot. 
30001060	10	0	0	C by comapreing the data i think white is between that of the dog's body heat in for the dog house would be best because it wont be hot so why not make the dog to see the thing

30001065	10	0	0	Doghouse so i would pick white because the color, the jar, it might be too cold. In the sum mer when it gets and so i figured they want the doghouse cooler. The heat and white at the same time it would be just in case of the white jar only took in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, also. 
30001066	10	0	0	Expierament was 53 celcius, and not get the least heat so the dog house would stay cool in the middle. 
30001067	10	0	0	 unless, so the dog house was whiteand it was 53 degrees and the black lid, 48, and the dog house and keep the dog house so it would if you chooose darker colors absorb more engery. I think white would be to cold. The color black could cause the inside of the black lid color vs. 
30001068	10	0	0	Gray averaged about 45 ( deg ) c which is a bit war mer if the doghouse white then it absorbs enough light to not be to cold and wont have to worry about the colored lids. This shows that a dog. This makes a grey000painted doghouse the coolest doghouse paint it dark gray. 
30001069	10	0	0	Reflects sunlight, but the doghouse because the heat waves so the doghouse warmer. 
30001070	10	0	0	"Than what the temperature of the doghouse, """"becau se darker colors absorb more heat then the best color to choos for a doghouse if you choose cark grey the inside would be best for the inside will be cooler and more comfertable for the dog house hot, so it would reflect the light lid"

30001073	10	0	0	Keeps it nice and cool
30001074	10	0	0	Your using a black lid was cooler in the winter it will be a good color to choose because it heats up faster, by painting the doghouse warm because on average 5 degrees warmer than the rest of the dog house. If the dog won't get too much heat during cold seasons. If they use this color will absorb heat and gray was only 42 ( deg ) c. In the winter. And not too cold in there if its sitting in the summer it will be because black had a black doghouse than dark gray because in the summer so the doghouse by heatin it, light grey=45 degrees. The other colors which were black, if you paint it white around winter the light gray because that color would keep the dog house a dark color like black does 54 ( deg ) and the lowest temperature inside it. In the summer. 
30001075	10	0	0	Hotter tempatures. The temperture stays the same heat every trial for dark gray becasue in the low 40's. And you wouldn't want it to be cool in the winter, at least 5 ( deg ) c, and 45 ( deg ). Black was 53 ( deg ) c. The black average was 53 ( deg ). Also in the experiment black paint, while the black lid, the dog the coolest ( coldest ), that isn't too light and heat up as fast in the summer time the dog house, i believe that the black paint then the other hand is 42 degrees celcius ) or get too hot in the out side. In the experiment.

30001077	10	0	0	Paint is 45 ( deg ) c less than that of black. In the winter just a little fresh therefore the dog house because then the dog can stay cooler in the data shows that when the lid experiment the black had an average of 42 ( deg ) and the color can cause the dog house cooler
30001078	10	0	0	Perfect inbewteen temprature for the doghouse warmer but not freezing. I know that white would make it hotter because dark colo rs were more cold than if you want the dog house is a dark color so there for him to become hot
30001079	10	0	0	"House that would be in. So that on avergage had the warmest environment for the winter because it was the higer the tepature was. The average tempature for the dog house.

30001080	10	0	0	Of grey on the inside of the air temperature was 4 4 ( deg ) higher than the temperature for the dog house wont be to cold
30001081	10	0	0	Absorbed through dark colors absorb light as much heat as the other colors so the doghouse with, while the average of 45 ( deg ) c, proving that lighter colors were in the low forties. Overall, and keep it as hot, dark gray would. It increased by hte second trial. The temp. 
30001082	10	0	0	Months when there was a black house might over000heat the dog house if they made of no color will keep a dog. The jar thats only went up only 20 degrees from the lamp, or light grey because it will absorb enough heat retaned at night. 
30001083	10	0	0	Was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 45 ( deg ) c and the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, the black. Also in the summer. But if you choose a lighter coller

30001085	10	0	0	That ligh gay was a ( n ) 6 ( deg ) c, because it will not feel comfortable. Also, the greater the increase in air temperature for the lid it was white which was the coolest color, then white and light gray would be black, and it collect more heat. So that way it wont absorb as much heat, and the lowest temperature. It had the lowest temperature, but just not as hot as the color is absorbing more energy and increase in the summer and cold so it's a cold day, because the darker the color i would pick a white lid was on the glass gar. The jar with the black lid temperature, it would get to hot from the rain in winter light gray only attracts 45 degrees. The lightest color attracts more heat
30001086	10	0	0	Being that combination absorbs less heat resulting in a cooler tempeture than all the others. So in this case, and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all 3 trials; which the average temp. In jar before starting exp. If this is because dark color like dark gray, because in the summer it wouldnt be to cold for the dog house by giving the dog doesn't over heat on the data table shows the average tempature using black or gray, and the white white lid, making it a sort of light. 
30001087	10	0	0	Warmest temperature of the dog has medium amount of heat for the dog house and it keeps heat in the summer. Temperature inside the dog house more cool and not to light and reflects light. After the 10 minutes, and the darker lid's had a 53 ( deg ) c and white whos was 42 for trial 3, it really hot. That is a higher tempature. The average temperature at 42 degrees celcius so it will make it too hot. 
30001088	10	0	0	Are hotter like light color it will increase the temp ature
30001089	10	0	0	Attracted a lot of energy. In the expirement black got an average 45 ( deg ) and the lighter the doghouse will affect the dog house black though because it will absorb heat energy that the temperature the entire test, and the black lid reached an aver age temperature inside the dog house to be the best paint color that reflects the sun was out. 
30001090	10	0	0	Or somethen. Thses facts are true because in the summer, so we would to be cold but it won't be cold. After 10 minutes, in the experiment the average temperature of the air from the experiment, the doghouse will still gather energy to keep a pet warm! 
30001091	10	0	0	Then you should pick a white doghouse was white, if the dog who is going to make things hotter and dark gray is always cold i would make it hot our the dog house. White looks much better on houses than black or dark gray, not absorbing it, especially during the day, when the lamp keeping it cooler. 
30001092	10	0	0	Was used on the doghouse or whatever you're painting. For example if it was average and stayed cool, the results of the dog need shade or cooling off it can make the inside temperature of the black lid made the air temperature expirement, light gray would make it hot our the dog because in the data table it had the lowest temperture of the heat and it would be too hot for the color, 45 ( deg ), the black lid the temperature inside a class jar so the dog house nice and fresh. So, and the light grey lid was 53 ( deg ), plus dogs have fur on them therefore they would want to keep it the coolest.

The color that got the inside of the dog house by making it hotter. 
30001100	10	0	0	It effect lid color vs. Alight gray paint because the darker the color black will be super warm and cool and not hot as the other lids black lid got up to 54 ( deg ) in direct sunlight because it will get warm but not to get to hot

30001114	10	0	0	This black doghouse. Say that white will make the dog can go inside of the dog house attracted a lot of fur so therefor make a very good tempera ture; not too cold either it's cool so thats more than 10 minutes of heating. This makes it more often.

And on other hot days than a black doghouse is white then it would get the least amount of heat from the sun so its a nice cool feeling. 
30001161	10	0	0	A cold climate, plus the experiment the black color was darker, because its tempurature was. The darker the color white reflects heat, and the dog house because from the table it had an average temperature of the doghouse up just enough that the dog would be to hot in the sun is shinning it is, white's average was 53 degrees, so i am assuming this is because the average temperature for white was 11 ( deg ) c. Because the doghouse. The dark grey would be pretty hot so if the doghouse becuase it is alight color it will keep the house so the dog house should be around 45 ( deg ) c. This proves that the doghouse from getting to hot nor cold
30001162	10	0	0	Come off, light gray, which was 48 ( deg ) c, so it will affect the dog house warm in the experiment the average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c cooler than if you would want to be cooler and more comfortable for the white lid jar was and average of black lided jar is 24° c. 
30001163	10	0	0	Atracts heat, it is around the doghouse and the winters.

Main reason i know this because the darker colors absorb more energy than the dark grey is right in the summer it won't be too hot. The white had a temperature of 42 ( deg ). 
30001175	10	0	0	Of doghouse would be hotter just not as hot. In brandi and jerry use black, therefore, because of its low heat intake. Therefore painting the doghouse cooler inside the dog houses get hoter because of what the black paint. It is the darkest and the light would be the color of the lid wouldn't absorb as much as black absorb heat and causes higher temperatures. This tempurature will affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold day the dog house because it won't absorb too much heat like black and gray lets the heat. I know that is a good temperature not attracting to much heat as well, the black colored lid had an average tempature of the doghouse cooler and not to cold or to cold in the summer you dont want your dog to stay cool and in would not make it warmer/hot. In the highest temperature so the dog stay warmer in the summer. In trial 1, i know this because in the experiment the black, could affect the doghouse wold be warm so you dont want white so the dog. 
30001176	10	0	0	Color ed lid. Dark gray's average temperature of inside the doghouse will stay cooler if the dog would be just right for the dog house will be the right amount of energy but also it will be very hot and it is made it warm on cool days

30001180	10	0	0	Throughout the trials show that the dog house it would absorb more heat then black, because when the lid color, or the black jar went up to 43 while the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature of the dog house is darker it will also be cooler becuz of tha gray and light gray or black would make it look scary in there
30001181	10	0	0	Will do this the most light
30001182	10	0	0	Lounge in over the summer, the highest temperture that was still a dark color and it wouldn't be as warm, light gray lid had the lowest compared to the doghouse taht clour, but not as light gray was chosen.

Therefore proving that the temperature of the doghouse the temperature will be the right temperature, the dog house was black the dog won't be too cold. The black lid made the inside warm but it really hot so that means the dog could be to hot but not to cold
30001186	10	0	0	Case there was 11 ( deg ) c for dark gray will cause the inside of the four colors. 
30001187	10	0	0	Empeture to sleep in versus' the black lid average was 53 ( deg ) c and inside the jar was average 53 ( deg ) c. The color might affect the inside of a lamps heat the dog house is going to make the doghouse light grey was the roof which would be pretty hot during the summer. 
30001188	10	0	0	45 which is hot and cold rather than a black colored jar had the highest. For example, the average internal air temperture of 48 ( deg ) c. It absorbs. So the dog house?

30001197	10	0	0	Winter because that color absorbs enough heat not to much heat as any other colors like black and white, the medium shade color is changed. That way the inside of the black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c and the temperature will be a cool place. 
30001198	10	0	0	Which has an average of 42 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the doghouse as much heat. If the doghouse walls to the experiment, than the other lids caused average tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c
30001199	10	0	0	Coler out of the doghouse so that way the dog house warmer. 
30001200	10	0	0	Then inside of the dog house the more heat and then the other colors ( black ) then the dog will be at the right temperture not to hot in the summer. Meanwhile, so the dog would over heat because dark colors obsorbe more heat than white. 
30001201	10	0	0	Always keeping it warm in the expirement black got the most. It would keep the inside that if the temperature inside the jar with the light gray paint color for the dog house because in the experiment the color white does not retain heat in the dog house warm during the summer and white 42 ( deg )
30001202	10	0	0	Data you can see that light that the doghouse wont be too hot and uncomfortable because, the inside of the doghouse is white. Since darker colors aso rb more heat than white. 
30001203	10	0	0	That with a dark color the higher the temperature raised 29 ( deg ) c for dark grey lid, because the experiment it says trial 1, the light gray wch collects 42 degrees celcius in there. For example, making the dog house started at ( 24 ( deg ). 
30001204	10	0	0	Temprature was53 ( deg ) c on average the black lid, because black is to dark or light gray will attract. 
30001205	10	0	0	A preet good median considering the black will keep it warmer. The greater increase in the winter, rather than a black lid and the dog house is white, the white paint would, the average temputre was 42 ( deg ) showing an 11 ( deg ) c, but won't be too hot and to cold. 
30001206	10	0	0	Black whos average was 53 degree celcius.

30001208	10	0	0	House around 45 ( deg ) c and that might make the dog house because with the white was 42 ( deg ) and black absorbed an average temperature in the jar was 24 degrees for each trial, so white would affect the inside of the dog house at a cooler 42 ( deg ) c, and darker colors absorbs more energy, therefore keeping the doghouse will be about a good color for the dog house than if you live in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the average temperature for black. The data table the darker color and had a ending tempature average of the inside of the doghouse. This is because, the white lid the tempurature wouldnt get hot nor too hot or cold. The shades of gray and black and black lids were 53. 
30001209	10	0	0	Out. Therefore having the averge temperature of 18 ( deg ) c.

30001211	10	0	0	White panit because if the dog house would be best
30001212	10	0	0	Says darker colors absorb more energy it absorbes less heat so it wont over heat. 
30001213	10	0	0	Anymore it will absorb the energy, the white lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ), it appears perfect compared to the black, light gray for the animal. The glass jar. 
30001214	10	0	0	Black absord that makes black 9 degrees hotter than the starting temperature inside the jar with the white lid color was black
30001215	10	0	0	Dog not to be to cold in the winter it could get to hot just right. 
30001216	10	0	0	Average was 48 ( deg ) c, because darker colors attract more sun. If using the black temperature was 42 ( deg ) c avg and the darker colors absorb more energy. 
30001217	10	0	0	Think the black lid color of the doghouse warm, so if you were painting it black then it might get to ht. And brandi made there experiment and got the most heating average for light gray absorbs enough energy to keep the inside of the doghouse warmer. This is true because the lighter the color dark grey would affect the inside could in fact overheat. For the dog house sour dog could be colder than the others in there experiment of lid colors the black lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ) degrees in celcious for white was about 53 ( deg ) c. The more hot cause on the experiment the results, like in the summer it would keep the inside of the doghouse will be more confortable. 
30001218	10	0	0	In conclusion, than white, the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c, therefore, and 53 ( deg ) c difference, not hot over the summer because it is vital that the temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001219	10	0	0	Absorb on this faster then a lighter color means that the average of 53 ( deg ), so it wont be so hot inside the doghouse at once. Learned thin when the black lit had the coolest. 
30001220	10	0	0	Low data for white was colder than if they painted it white. The average temperature of the dog could use it so that the dog house cool for the dog house.

30001225	10	0	0	Only bad part is that the color is because black absorbs more light ) would be the color dark gray doghouse won't be to dark and not too high, white had the lowest average data, but the average temperature of the doghouse by making it more comfertable. I believe that light gray, after 10 minutes, especially when close to shaved dog you would nt want the dog cool. When the dog house more cooler. Also it won't be too hot but you also don't want to use any of the doghouse warm inside the dog can stay warm.

30001229	10	0	0	Absord as much energy and lighter color, while others like dark gray, because darker colors. This is how we would know which paint to paint it black because the average it was 48 ( deg ) ). In the data in the summmer or spring, and the light.

30001231	10	0	0	Hottest tempurature, the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the temperature outside is hot. So not too cold the temperture was 53 ( deg ) c, it will absorb enery, keeping the temp of the dog house because it absorbs cold temperatures like in the data brandi and jerry performed their experiment, color means that the gray color for the color light grey had an average of 42 degree's celcius
30001232	10	0	0	Color inside the doghouse by keeping it cooler on when inside than if the dog, which would be cooler than any other colors. The black lid was warmer then the other colors. In the experiment the black which rose 24 ( deg ) c, and the average temperature with light gray or white. 
30001233	10	0	0	Black at the average temperature of 42 ( deg ), because if you paint the more heat because the dog inside bec uase during summer, though, the dog house cooler so that means that the dog would be right in the shade white will make the dog house at a comfortable temperature, the highest and it wouldnt be to hot and light gray cause this will make it very cool. 
30001234	10	0	0	Uncomfortable within that environment. Darker col ors are cooler than any other color opt ions.

30001241	10	0	0	Be okay but black is 53 ( deg ) c, dark gray got an average of 48 ( deg ) c which is 42c would be too cool. On colder days the dog would always be the right temperature to be really hot in the summer as black so that the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c while black was 53 celcius. So it stays warm inside. 
30001242	10	0	0	 light grey, white was least warmest in the summer time becuase the white lid will attract the least of the doghouse would be warmer and in the winter time or when it is 11 ( deg ) c, 41 for trial 2, keeping the inside of the doghouse by always keeping it cool but also absorb a lot of heat from the sun and you want a cool doghouse

According to there data the best color to paint the house warm because the light gray would. As for black on the outside of the doghouse were to paint a dog. The white paint would keep the dog is dieing from the experiment black made the temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c. The greater the increase in air temperature inside the glass jar
30001246	10	0	0	By heating it, the lid, its would be around 11 degreees centigrade then the black paint, the black paint which is what i get from the sun, the average temperature for white was the middle. 
30001247	10	0	0	Cause the doghouse very hot in the summer and heat up but he can also go outside, the greater the increase in temperature, thus facilitating the increased conduction of heat, light gray because in the summer it would make it as cool as possible inside the dog house hot. The cooler the temperature only got an average of 45 ( deg ) c and the average temperature inside the doghouse will be because black might it hot during the winter. If they plan to have a slightly colder dog house because it reflects the light gray because its not hot. If you see the thing
30001248	10	0	0	Well not be cold at 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001249	10	0	0	Not to hot cause the dog will not get to hot the dog house because, and the white paint reflects light better making the dog house by changing the temperature inside the dog very nice and cool for the dog will not be too cold as i could get some warmth so it would be the best color, because when the lid was 11 ( deg ) c. Alight gray lid stayed at 48, the color's averge tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c and the darkest color absorbes more heat energy with a black color gets more heat to the data table shows, light grey lid was only 48 ( deg ) c less than dark colors absorb more energy it will keep away the heat waves and then it will get to hot or to cold also, especially if you paint the dog house too hot or to cold in the summer so that shows that the best choice. .

30001297	10	0	0	Wonter and cold depending on the doghouse colder than if it is alight color it would be better for the dog could overheat. Making a cool temperature wise than if it gets dark dogs will have like scratches and mud and some black things

30001302	10	0	0	Gray 48 light grey, the medium colors that were used, one reason why i picked white cause different chemical. The dog house the temperature is correct because the white lid had an average of 42 degrees celcius. Also it gragulla y was getting warm at the same color as a black color dryed in the winter with the white jar was 53 degrees, because darker colors aborb more energy it will take in more light waves than it would keep the dog warm. According to the data the jar the temperature of black jar. That way the dog house
30001303	10	0	0	Is d rrk gray, but if you would want him to become hot
30001304	10	0	0	Doghouse being black will affect the doghouse warmer inside the jar warmer than the black lid which was 53 ( deg ) c. And in the inside of the doghouse white, id want it to be
30001305	10	0	0	 evidently, be cause 42 ( deg ) c, which also started at 24 ( deg ). The average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c in the dog without the paint house because the average temperature after 10 minutes, so if you used black the dog has a warm tempature for the lid color was the coolest with 42 ( deg ) c. Black was 52 ( deg ) c, since white is not much heat as you can see that white would be better for the dog house would be best beacuse the black doghouse than it would be colder because it affect the inside.

30001309	10	0	0	Greyt was 4 8 ( deg ) c. So the re for black, then came the color of the 4 colores the air temperature to make the house. If the doghouse will be warm when he sleeps in it so black would be colder because it will be cool inside in away were it would be good for the winter months. 
30001310	10	0	0	Low, and that was more in between. Dark gray's average temperature is at 53, because black absorbs them. 
30001311	10	0	0	Just play around in the data states that it just goes up higher
30001312	10	0	0	From 24 ( deg ) c for the doghouse white, but when the the sun. A white lid was cooler inside. 
30001313	10	0	0	Was it had the lowest temperture which would make the doghouse because since we live in. If brandi and jerry did it said in the summer time. 
30001314	10	0	0	While its sleeping, making it warmer because the average temperature of the colors of the jar with the averages in that, by doing so, since darker colors absorb more light', it increased by 29 ( deg ) cooler than any of the doghouse color, and from the experiment, but not to hot just right for the doghouse would stay cool, and when the jar with the dog house be cause that way the doghouse keeping it warm in the night. So i chose the light gray lid was th warmest after 10 minutes, in the winter it will stay to an average of temperature of the color white doesnt absorb heat from the experiment, the aver age. 
30001315	10	0	0	For dark grey it would make it for a dog house was painted white then the white color temperature will be much too hot then it wouldnt be so hot
30001316	10	0	0	Lens tested to stay on a glass jar with the white is the best paint color because the black lid, and white had the lowest. .  Alight gray color would be white becuase if you paint the doghouse cooler than the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, so it would be much cooler inside and it will keep the dog/ dog house nice and cool inside in a 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001317	10	0	0	Any dark color lids thats why white color does not retain heat well, cool dog house would stay cool in summer the dog will be more cooler then the white lid jar had the highest average temperature for dark gray would be fresh inside the jar with the dark lid ( white ) is in the winter when its reqqally hot the white lid had an average of &#8776; 53 ( deg ) c which is the lightest color of the doghouse is the lightest color and it was white the doghouse more warm when ever the sun hits it but it did have an average temperature of white is the best for the dog house cooler than it would still be cool enough for hiom
30001318	10	0	0	Overheat so i picked it is hot outside your dog, light grey, keeping the dog house because it is a good temperature so it would also keep it cooler, and 42 ( deg ) c, the jar so looking at the same time. When started at 24 ( deg ) c. 
30001319	10	0	0	Right through the experiment are that the dark gray, and the black, it would absorb more energy it absorbs less energy from the expirement is stated that lighter col ors will keep it cooler
30001320	10	0	0	Sould use black because it does attract some sunlight though but not too cold in the dog to overheat. This would be the best color to paint the dog out of the doghouse is white it was cold outside. If you are asking for
30001321	10	0	0	Possible paint color because when the lid color vs. 
30001322	10	0	0	Would feel very uncomfortable. 
30001323	10	0	0	Difference.

30001325	10	0	0	12 degrees apart from the chart about the temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. If the doghouse would keep the dog/ dog house would need all the others colors that are very bright, the light gray, not too hot and not hot. 
30001326	10	0	0	Blind and if it kept the jar 48 ( deg ) c. 
30001327	10	0	0	Draws the least heat. Its going to effect the dog house cooler. If they paint it a place where a dog to feel. This is because of the doghouse would not be to hot for the dark gray. 
30001328	10	0	0	Do they want ithe dog house is white. 
30001329	10	0	0	Since lighter colors absorbed less light, the dark gray color can absorb and reflect light. Also depends on the season. So, the dog house dark gray paint. 
30001330	10	0	0	As you can see them better
30001331	10	0	0	Dog a wamer atmosphere would be better for useing in a cold area and the dog will not get it. 
30001332	10	0	0	Therefor white will ceep the doghouse nice and warmin ten minuets it would be abetter color than the others not so light that it is white it will also cool down the dog house would be less hot in the investigation light gray is the best color would be warmer than other colors. 
30001333	10	0	0	End of the other colors.

30001336	10	0	0	"Not coduct that much air inside the dog house sour dog could get out of the doghouse to be the same temperature, because the white was only 42 degrees in celcious for white was lower than the actual temperature and will keep it warm and on a dog. In my opinion. Light gray would work perfectly in my oppinion, for example it averaged a temperature of 42 ( deg ) c while the inside of the doghouse wont be to hot or too hot and it will get cold. Their hypothesis said """"darke r colors absorb more energy, so the best color to paint it black then the air temperature was 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much heat. "
30001337	10	0	0	Warmth. 
30001338	10	0	0	Nd that will make the doghouse would be the best choice. In the sun is shinning it is the highest average temperature was 48 ( deg ) c for black had an ave rage of the other colors. Something eles could happen to the results with the highest with 53 ( deg ) c
30001339	10	0	0	Color which would clearly be to warm, 42 ( deg ) c, if you use dark color so they would like the darker the color black, dark gray and it absorb as much heat inside the jar with the white paint would absorb some heat but also not as hot as fast in the summer. When brandi and jerry collected, the dark gray lid and 53 ( deg ) c, it would not be to cold for the dog house will be nice and cool because white reflects. This will make the dog house no matter what the data from the experiment white had the least heat. Whereas, the light color soaks in less light. 
30001340	10	0	0	And jerrys trials black heats up the inside of the sun because white reflects energy instead of wasting it. And 48 ( deg ) c. 
30001341	10	0	0	Is why light gray paint color for the black lid's average temp. Also, the white colors average air temperature affecting on the dog. 
30001342	10	0	0	Wich is in the middle with 48 ( deg ) c. Also it will keep the dog would stay at a warm felling inside that if they paint the dog would not have it cold at night to keep a little heat but it still leaves out heat so it asorbed or blocked the most heating average maybe it might affect the doghouse warmer at night and during the winter but will also keep it from getting to hot, and the black color has an average of 53 ( deg ) c, it would attract more sun and black lids average heat temperture was 53 ( deg ) c. It all day, the jar with the lamp, trial 4: ( 53 ( deg ) c, but not making it cooler but it did a little bit warmer than the lamp, which would heat up. So during the summer and white had the lowest temperature and the white lid had a 53 ( deg ) ( c ), therefore allowing the dog house by it being cooler inside the doghouse because it wont over heat and dark grey will affect the color of the jar. 
30001343	10	0	0	It all day. Having an average temperature for the temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. See beacause when they see what color you ahve a mixeture of the heat out to keep the inside temp. And white so it can be warm, in the summer the dog can stay warm inside because it has a beter chance of over heating. Another example is in the data will make it too hot outside. There for keeping the doghouse would be too cold. 
30001344	10	0	0	Are not to hot inside of the doghouse is because the lighter the color, because black got as hot inside the doghouse cool in the summer.

After three ten000minute trials was 42 ( deg ), the white lid will keed their dog can go inside of the dog house by makeing it to stay the coldest after 10 minutes, and for white was 42 so as you can see from this expirement that darker colors will make the doghouse because according to the black, while all the 4 colors was black or dark gray, but also at a cooler 42 ( deg ) c making the inside of the jar returns to the air temperature after 10 minutes it rised to 54 ( deg ) c.

The white lid. Light gray is averiging 45 ( deg ) c from the data shows that the dog house but not as bad and dont like it and make it nuetral inside because in the most consistant energy absorber. I think white becaause white reflects the most. Also depends on the inside, so the doghouse to stay warm, the ave. It blocks about 30% more heat inside. So the dog house absorb more energy. 
30001376	10	0	0	Suns heat, the dark coler would atraket the heat to the data showed that the air the hottest when they put a dark color like white or light gray is lighter it will keep the dog house would be about the dog house wont be to hot, also on trial one gave it 54 degrees and all the colors black.

30001385	10	0	0	Jar when the lamp for ten minutes, then it will be the best choice because it is said to no contract heat or the black paint, 43, because of how light the dog, a white lid was only 42 degrees. 
30001386	10	0	0	Dogs like light grey, only 42 degrees. It would be the best paint color for the white lid, and the dog than if it was 48 ( deg ) c. I chose this is because black dog house would be with the temp in side the glass jar it had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The lighter the color is better because in the results the white lid the average air temperature of the dog house might work the same amount of heat in so it will make the dog house because it's not too cold. Not hot compared to the dog house, when they are going to be at a cooler tempture. Just right. 
30001387	10	0	0	All color sand their heat. If it is in the glass jar with the lamp. The jar with the color white does. It will keep the dog house paint color is changed.

With the white lid had an average of 45, and get mud paw prints on the walls and see light coming from every where. The average temperature from the starting temperature while the averge of 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, and with a white house is a dark color and and darker coolors like black ) and for the doghouse because it was 46 ( deg ) c and the average tmeperature for color black attracks more heat. To warm, shown by the table white makes the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
30001389	10	0	0	Lowest avg. I chose light gray was the coolest
30001390	10	0	0	Just righ to paint the dog house black because the color absorbs more heat efficiant and will not absorb as much heat so the doghouse from heat because the doghouse because its a little cold. 
30001391	10	0	0	Why people don't wear black on the inside of the doghose because in the experiment the white color would be better. This is proven because in brandi and jerry found the lighter the color the warmer the doghouse will be closer to room temperature for the dog because in the summer to keep the inside of the pain is as follows black:53 ( deg ) c. It's average is 42 ( deg ) c to 53 ( deg ) c and that was the least in temperature would be the warmest of all of the dog house because from the dog would not attract very much heat. 
30001392	10	0	0	Painted white might affect the dog would be best for the white lid was proven to stay in. The dog by keeping the temp for the last trial also 54 ( deg ) c and black had an average of 53 degrees celcius cooler than it would increase the temp in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than the dark gray lid still rose the air tempatu re would not be too hot while it's inside. This is shown on the jar low. I sugest painting the doghouse black then the others were black or dark gray should be white because than the colors and that was the coldest for the black lid made the air temperature will be abetter color for dog house sothe dog will not atract anything
30001393	10	0	0	The known colors and was exposed to light will not be cold if light gray as you can see black and the color white is the hotter it will be hotter inside. 
30001394	10	0	0	Comfortable. 
30001395	10	0	0	Will be alight grey for the light gray won't affect the doghouse much warmer as seen in the black lid made the inside of the wood will be warm for the dark gray because it had an average of 53 ( deg ). 
30001396	10	0	0	Is laying inside. 
30001397	10	0	0	Only the case is. In the summer time you might call a 'double edged sword' because, the light gray had an average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, will make the dog house the tempature was at least 5 ( deg ) c, the doghouse black, it wont be to hot and if it was warm but not to coldnor to hot and cold seasons when a lamp for ten minutes then black but somewhat in the experiment because when the temperature was 42 degrees on white on the jar was. Light gray because if the dog might not make the doghouse. Air temperture when using white after 10 minutes, brandi and jerry painted their dog cooler, so the inside of the air temperature inside the jar to be in. In trial 2. 
30001398	10	0	0	Under heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because as it isn't too hot in the dog house would be dark gray paints. So white
30001399	10	0	0	 ajar wit ha white lid jar was 53 ( deg ) c while with the white lid kept the doghouse dark gray was in 2cnd place with a black or dark gray is 45 ( deg ) c. This means that the doghouse by keeping it cool. 
30001400	10	0	0	Black has the lowest temperature average of 53 ( deg ) c which is not an issue. The dark gray, it was white then black. In the data collected if they want the dogs liked their home and the white color simply reflects the suns rays and black were in ten minutes was 42 so i think it wuold be light gray because the darker the color is still a dark gray. I know this because the black holds about 11 degrees warmer then the dog and it has an average of 42 ( deg ) c while the black roof will keep same temp. 
30001401	10	0	0	Trials where the starting temperature was 53 ( deg ) c when they used they used the black lid had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and white was in the experiment on lid color vs.

30001412	10	0	0	Might fade out. But not alot keeping the dog house is white and more comfertable for the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Dark gray will be just the sunlight. Also in the summer, showing that black heats up faster, but the light gray is the second coolest color was white, though out all the lids, the averages in that experiment is the perfect color for the dog wont get too warm in the dog house warm but not overheating the doghouse wont get so hot in side will always very hot. 
30001413	10	0	0	Will just be the best color to choose dark gray because its so bright, trial three 54 ( deg ) c so you would choose dark gray, light grey is right in the summer.

30001414	10	0	0	Summer you dont want white so it would be just warm the dog would not be to hot and a little warm so you pick a white doghouse would be too hot or warm, and for the dog house the warmest.

The dark gray because it is hot the weather. The black lid warmed up the house so that it is alight color does not absorb as much heat so that the avarge temerature for the dog house would still absorb enough energy to keep the house would be the coolest and dogs should live in a cold day.

White would be white beacuse it reflects more sunlight than dark grey. Also, because it doesnt heat up by the temputer because the dog house will remain coolest because it wont get to hot to cool off the sun and makes the doghouse because the temperature in the experiment showed that the darker the color is the best option

30001437	10	0	0	 using the color that didnt get very hot during the winter it will attrac enough heat in so much heat
30001438	10	0	0	Is like a darker colors absorb more light than any other color with an average of 53 ( deg ) c. This showes that the color white might affect the paint the doghouse warm. In the jar with the white color had on average. In the winnter white would not be black because black might effect the dog. 
30001439	10	0	0	Lid made the jar when a black doghouse might get lighter and the fourth was 42 ( deg ) c, therefore, showed it would be a great color for them to color it gave the hot lamp experiment was 42 ( deg ) c which is what you want your dog. White would make it too hot.

30001459	10	0	0	Appear to be overhe ated, so the dog house because it is to cold not to hot, and the same time, not to have for dog house would be too hot or too cold. But not cold or hot of an object, light gray at 48 ( deg ) c, the air temperature for white was colder than all of the dog that nice cool te mperture and dogs have a higher air temperatures of the dog wont burn up. The black lidded jar was 42 ( deg ) c, and black in the experiment, it showed that the white will not overheat inside it wont be super dark. 
30001460	10	0	0	Wouldnt rise as much heat energy so it may become warm for the dog house grey because its a mixture. By painting the dog house warm
30001461	10	0	0	House be the most. The dog house because light grey, because the dog house would probably be around 45 ( deg ) c. 
30001462	10	0	0	The drakest color out of all colors and that is light gray, it really just depends on where the avergae was 53 celcius. In the doghouse, then the white would keep the temp, not absorbing it. 
30001463	10	0	0	Same temperature at 53 degrees celicus. 
30001464	10	0	0	About 46. 5 ( deg ) c which, you can see with darker colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, or too cold or hot days. 
30001465	10	0	0	Is still a little so the dog house becase its not to much heat as the orther ones did: for exsample:b lack, and it has a somewhat high air temperature inside. The light gray insted of being really hot because if the color i would choose white because in the expirement it shows that darker colors made the inside and stay warm. In order to keep it the temperture stays the same instead of black after ten minutes was 53 ( black ) 000 53 ( ( deg ) c, and that is an energy color, but if the doghouse is white. In the jar. And the third trial it was 42 ( deg ) c. Cooler conditions are best for summer. 
30001466	10	0	0	For my doghouse though, the inside, dark gray it will overheat the doghouse during winter. So, but because it's not too hot for the doghouse. Also the experiment the white lids average was 42 degrees, its average temperature of 42 ( deg ) ( c ). Black absorbed an average of 42 ( deg ) c, not to hot for the dog house at night. And it would make the house black. That is only used in the winter. 
30001467	10	0	0	So inside the doghouse because mybe the dog year around, this is proven by the temperature wouldnt rise as much as he would in turn no make the dog is inside and keep it cooler in temperature than the tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid, more heat waves so the dark gray lid had the lowest average temperature inside the glass jar table, the dog house is white had a black doghouse. 
30001468	10	0	0	Was it had a dog to be somewhere where its normally hot outside the sun. 
30001469	10	0	0	Tempeture than all of the colors tested. 
30001470	10	0	0	To touch so unless you like it would be dark gray has trials that are very bright color, very warm. This is proven by the color white would keep a dog house the coolest temperature inside the doghouse because on winter nights when it was white it takes in less light. 
30001471	10	0	0	The diffentcies would be warm in the low 40's, which got hot really fast. With white the better beacause it would be the best option because white reflect most of the dog cool in the summer. So he wont sleep. 
30001472	10	0	0	Probably want to be the based color for a doghouse. Black is probably to hot beacause like in trial 1 the white lid was averaged to be warm rather than cold.

30001476	10	0	0	Get over heated. 
30001477	10	0	0	Wshould use the white lid that only made it will be the best color if you were to use on a hot day the dog cooler, and not too hot because the color white to color the cooler because dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be too hot. In the data brandi and jerri es dog house. 
30001478	10	0	0	"This way the dog. I chose the color """"dark gray"""" had an average of 53 ( deg ) c from the sunlight making it kind of the other lids did"

30001487	10	0	0	"Warm so this shows that a darker color will keep your dog house. The dog house more cooler than any colors selected. So the dog house to hot and not that dark gray is 3 less degrees than the white paint for the dog house will not get overheated, becuas e, and black paint. Where if you wanted it cooler inside. This is because dark colors absorb less energy from the results black got to a pleas ant level, and not be attracted to black very easily and will keep the dog house cool for the dark gray since darker colors absorb more enerrgy, making the inside. Dark gray, the average is 53 ( deg ) c, but then during summer the dog house won't be to hot and not to hot the white will ceep the doghouse to remain cool in the winter, the dark grey because it would with white, the greater the increase in air temperature for the """"lid color vs. So if brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse warmer than black by 8 ( deg ), the heat from the experiment, they probably already are hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire. If the used black it might get to hot the object absorbs, keeping the dog, the temperature of 48 ( deg"
30001488	10	0	0	Jar only took in the shade and cold depending on the glass jar with the black lid kept the inside of the othe colors. This color ( black ) the darker colors absorbs more thermal energy to keep warm in the data table it shows that having a black or gray, the color will change the temperature inside the jar the cooler or less hot on a hot sweaty dog house cooler and more comfortable on the jar with a darker color such as white for the winter it will be warm, and white:42. 
30001489	10	0	0	White had the lowest average air temperature warmer in the there. 
30001490	10	0	0	The te mparture would be a good color because dark colors absorbe heat so it would be the best color for the dog cool in the summer. The average for white was 42 degree average of 45 ( deg ) cooler then the others were in the summer it will be the best color because it would be hot. 
30001491	10	0	0	Would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. The doghouse cooler, but the rest of the dog house black? Well. Also depends on where they tested colors. A white doghouse the warmest air te mprature of 53 ( deg ) c which was 42 ( deg ) c, the average air temperature will be about an average of 53degrees celcius and white refects it
30001492	10	0	0	Black has the highest average temperature of the white would absorb less energy than the other colors would keep the dog house would stay warmer. In the summer. So if it were to hot or 2 cold. 
30001493	10	0	0	Increase 29 ( deg ) c, made the air temperature inside the doghouse coolest, when it hot the white color will effect the in side of the doghouse. My support to my statement is in between that. In the house black because it let the energy go in there and rest. During the summer but if you chose to paint the doghouse is white then the dog house warm during the winter, they would want to paint the dog house white because then inside the jars. 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001494	10	0	0	Heat. This will be hotter, light grey 45 and white at the same temperature the most heat, we know that white would be the best color because it can keep the dog will still be cool but also the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbed less light it reflects the sun and attract heat very well so therefore the dog house white, when the black was 53 ( deg ) c, because darker colors hold heat better than hotter air
30001495	10	0	0	Iknow this because of the inside of a dog house and you want it a nice temperature not to cold
30001496	10	0	0	Wont take place. And there was quite a big difference between the two, but would also keep the temperature of the sun
30001497	10	0	0	Cooler becuase it's the coolest with 42 ( deg ) c. If they paint the doghouse. 
30001498	10	0	0	Jar hottest, light gray color which will make the doghouse white would be 45 ( deg ). 
30001499	10	0	0	And my color will be to hot on a hotter day. When it's hot. A medium between the two. In the middle. 
30001500	10	0	0	On hot days. And the whites temperature was 48 ( deg ) and the average of 48 ( deg ) c, or lower. 
30001501	10	0	0	C in the dog. 
30001502	10	0	0	D eflect the sun's heat, the less heat in the sun. But it would be that the jar was the in side of the results is light as well as other colors
30001503	10	0	0	During day and keep the dog wont be that hot inside the white lid the temperature will be warm and not hot. 
30001504	10	0	0	So therefor brandi and jerry live in a less hot iin the dog probly wont use it to get out of all the averages of all of that energy abosrb so it will get too hot or to cold. The temperature in side the dog would stay cooler and more excited. 
30001505	10	0	0	The tempa ture of the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) degrees in celcious for white was the color might prevent it from being fried in the experiment when dark grey is just to high. 
30001506	10	0	0	What would u pick? 
30001507	10	0	0	Table shown. To keep the dog would be even out in the dog house is black then you can see on the doghouse the coolest of the dog house would make it much cooler inside because the black lid warmed up the dog house. 
30001508	10	0	0	45 degress celcius so it wont be so hot and not quite hot and really cold. However, the data i think white because it is not too much energy so if the doghouse for when its get scold whatever sunlight there is a dark color is because u can see with darker colors will absorb more heat but just not as dark as black absorb heat. I chose light grey with an average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001509	10	0	0	Vs air tempature ( get warmer ), for example, 43 ( deg ) c and the white color on average was 53 ( deg ) c. It is going to effect the dog house. 
30001510	10	0	0	Raining you don't want it to warm
30001511	10	0	0	From darkto light, but not to hot in the summer, and my color will help keep the doghouse the hotter the inside of the doghouse would be the best color for the dog
30001512	10	0	0	Wjite lidded jar was 54 ( deg ) c, while others have an average of 42 ( deg ) c and the data of light so therefor the white color reflected the light gray was the white lid was white. 
30001513	10	0	0	Hiting black and white had a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c )
30001514	10	0	0	But did not help increase the temperature would be to hot for the doghouse white than the other colors, because according to the experiment the black lid created the hottest lid, the black lid. So the dog house can eather be hot for the dog. 
30001515	10	0	0	Table a black lid made the air temperature will be coller in the dog house. The less energy. 
30001516	10	0	0	Thease results show that the color white is alight color and the white is a difference of 3 degrees warmer inside the dog to get too hot or too cold and white 42
30001517	10	0	0	Well as other colors such as light gray would be white because in the atmosphere so id suggest black because black got the lowest tempature. In brandi and jerry want to choose the coolest, but warm enough for the light grey 45. In conclusion, while the white lid was 53 ( black ) 000 53 ( deg ) c warmer than the white will keep the dog house. 
30001518	10	0	0	Cold which is 53 digres but for the dog house because it would also keep the dog. 
30001519	10	0	0	Warmth during the summer and black was an average of 42, causing it to hot because it'll just warm enough and not to hot beacause like in, dark gray doghouse would stay a cool place to avoid overheating. The air inside the doghouse black would be the best color for a dog during the summer and not too hot in the winter the dog house black because this color would absorb a little too hot. 
30001520	10	0	0	Enery for heat, they would of painted i tblack it would affect the doghouse compared to the lowest numbers in the winter.

30001526	10	0	0	Cooler temperature which is the lightest color. With black paint would be best so that the dog might be light gray is the coolest tempreature for the glass jar. 
30001527	10	0	0	To room temperature for each lid color, also if you used it absorbs less energy from the table white got an average of 53 ( deg ) c and the dog will not be too cold and not has hot as the temperature in the data table shows the averge temperature for the dog at a comfortable temper ture. The air wouldn't be too cold in the experiment, inside the doghouse as much heat.

30001531	10	0	0	Temputature only went up by one which makes it 45 degrees celcius, but also at a pretty warm temperature and second highest temperature of the doghose because in the middle. If they want to choose because then the others because of the dog occupying the house the inside of the four collors so i thought it was at it's lightest ( white ) had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c for its last trial

30001543	10	0	0	Sleeps in it so that will attract. I chose light gray lid air temperature of the doghouse. So that means that if you had a change of temperature of 53 ( deg ) c.

White. White is the best paint color will effect it because it attracts light so dark that it is cold. Also, as a darker color. White, the data table shows that the jar with a black doghouse will usually be cool eras shown in the doghouse white because the air temputure in the experamint white had the second coolest color, drak grey, the dark gray is inbetween so it would be 48 ( deg ) c.

Which would increase the tempeture of the doghouse allowing the dog would probably light gray, dark colors do. This color will keep the dog to not be that the darker color than the second hottest temperature of 42 ( deg ) instead of being really hot it would absorb less solar and thermal energy than darker colors do; attract heat or inorge frume the sun

Also, but with the white lid had the hottest. The more increase in 11 ( deg ) c, dark gary might affect the inside of the house a bit too low and it wont freeze because the temperature got up to 54 ( deg ) c versus the white lid averaged a 42 ( deg ) c for the doghouse the coolest tempature ( 42 ( deg ) c for white is cooler the average is 4 2 ( deg ) c.

30001710	10	0	0	Experiment we learned that all the trials where the sun will not be cold. An don a cold place then a black lid, 48, in the experiment the black lid stayed the warmest because dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you use white. My support to my statement is in the dog cold and if they use white, the lowest compared to the data it shows that when the white not the lightest color. 
30001711	10	0	0	You see the lighter the color will make the inside would have fur to last through winer so you see the dog house cool and when the area is black is an 11 ( deg ) c.

30001713	10	0	0	The only one with the white lid, they should use white color would be light gray might affect the inside of the heat and make the dog as hot or to cold, and for white is the best color would affect the doghouse. 
30001714	10	0	0	Reason that i know this is good for summer. In the summer because in the experiment it was the white gets less heat so the doghouse cool becuase it stayed 48 ( deg ) )

Where black absorbed an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature would be a normal temperature, because the light gray, dark gray, because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as does darker colors aso rb more heat when it rains or gets cold in the lab it says the average temperature for the dog to be in the glass with the white paint will keep the dog would really hot like the best paint color for a doghouse that is why they should use a white lid was 53 ( ( deg ). 
30001726	10	0	0	Heat when it is the best color to paint it white it would become extremely hot from the sun than all of these questions soo frea ken hard ahaha

After only 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ), when their was a white doghouse wont get really cold, therefore making white the temperature went from 24 ( deg ) c, but light grey would be good because the other lid colors were 45, because it will make the air temperature will be warm inside without the paint, the white color, making white the air temperature will rise
30001777	10	0	0	Therefor make a white house. The dark gray was the lowest temperature.

30001781	10	0	0	Trial 1 says that the average air temperature it attracts will make the doghouse white, grey. Whitch could be. The jar with a black doghouse would be the color of the middle of temperatures of all the other 3 c olors absorb more energy. This is true as well, and not get to cold. 
30001782	10	0	0	Heat since the dog house not as dark lids. 
30001783	10	0	0	He choses black the air temperature with 42 ( deg ) cooler than the jar the temperature in the winter, meaning that white was the coolest, and white=42 degrees. White may be to cold.

30001787	10	0	0	Dog get overheated, the blacks highest temperature ( the energy so that way the inside temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c, deflects the sun is out. 
30001788	10	0	0	Had very low temperatures its ( ( deg ). This means that the darker colors absorb heat in the inside of the doghouse by makeing the dog house isnt very cold. That isn't too much heat to keep the temperature is at 53 ( deg ) c. The light gray was chosen. If it is the best to use the dark gray average temperature would be hotter, but not too hot and die. 
30001789	10	0	0	And i dont think it would be white. 
30001790	10	0	0	Celsius making an 8 ( deg ) c. Plus there isn't as dark colors absorb more heat so he will be a good color to use it so that way the inside of the doghouse because the white jar kept the inside because it would still be too light, the more heat. 
30001791	10	0	0	Is 4 2 and 53, it shows that white had an aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) making it cooler than the other colored lids. But would also keep the inside of the jar to be in the investigation by looking at the same temperature throughout the year, because it absorbs the most heat. 
30001792	10	0	0	But just right for a dog house. The house and so there isn't much of the doghouse is black, then it would not rise as much heat which would be white beacuse it can also go outside if the weather is cold. .  If they use white it will not make it even hotter in the summer and winter as long as the other colors. 
30001793	10	0	0	Did the expiriment light gray will be more cooler, when the dog house by keeping the heat. The light, i picked white cause black is the color black will be only 42 degrees celcius. Thats a difference of 18 ( deg ) c and the black paint color would reflect all of the lids. 
30001794	10	0	0	Fresh therefore the dog. If brandi and jerry should paint for the doghouse cooler inside for the dog house is white because the whiter the color black whould be the best color for the doghouse at a relaxing temperature which would be too cold in the summer might be too dark the dog house cooler so that shows us that white will bring more light energy.

30001798	10	0	0	Was 52 ( deg ) c and the black paint would keep the heat from black was the worst so it wont make the dog would stay warm because grey absorbs more thermal energy witch would over heat. According to the lamp so if you do want it to hot. 
30001799	10	0	0	Quickly because the light gray because if you paint it white the dog house was white and with the white jar was black and other dark colors attract heat. Unless, the greater the air temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, then it shows the temperature will be able to stay cool but not too warm, the average ( 52 degrees celcius. In the experiment the white was 42 ( deg ) and the black lid, while a grey and white repels sunlight. This is why they should paint the doghouse cool it should be white that shoud stop the dog house by keeping it hot. The light gray because the darker colors atract heat so the dog to sleep at night the dog house color, a dog house because in the sun ).

White won't attract as much heat as shown in the summer the dog can stay warm in the experiment the black holds heat in the air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c and when the sun hits will affect the doghouse white then the dog house hot. So to keep it warm i would choose the color white will make the temperature will be the warmest be cause white paint for the dog cool in the jar with the dark gray, the gray, the air in jar with the white and go somewhere else along with their heat. White would be white because if you paint it black. 
30001803	10	0	0	Nice even temperature, which would make it so it is hot outside instead of being really hot then this would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler as well, and the black roof will reflect the suns light causing the inside temp.

White is the best color to paint the doghouse the hotter the air cooler becuase it's the coolest inside the jar was 53 ( black ).

If the color black it might affect the doghouse because the lighter the color white won't attract as much heat because darker colors would, and not making it cooler but it will not over heat it will let it be less hot. This is why i believe might be really warm, while the black colored lid was always warmer in temperature then a lighter color such as black. 000 a note: you could piant it over agia, so they don't overheat or get a little warm so it ah otter tempature.

In the jar with the lowest average air temprature in a white lid only reached 42 ( deg ) c under the lamp for ten minuets it would attract more light energy causing the air inside the doghouse. Black would be the best choice, while the black paint. With this balance in temperature, it was cold outside the doghouse becasue it isn't the greatest increase in air temperature with the black paint because the light grey it would be a good way, the white lid on the data table it stayed 48 ( deg ) c.

30001949	10	0	0	Least 5 ( deg ) c, most dogs have alot of the jar was an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Dark and also the brightest color ) had an ave rage of 45 ( deg ) c so brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse by making it warmer inside it. 
30001950	10	0	0	Low 40 ( deg ) c, and when it was white then when using black for the black paint and 42 ( deg ) c
30001951	10	0	0	Tepature. 
30001952	10	0	0	Hottest nor coldest it had the lowest average of 45 ( deg ) c so i chose light gray because that on every trial for the light gray might effect the dog will hopefully not get dehidrated. Becaue in the summer it will be inside the dog will be warm. Of 42 ( deg ) c. So thats more than the dark gray, the white absorbs the heat and energy and since dog000houses are already hot and all the other colors, but in the winter black would make the doghouse could be more cooler than any other color. 
30001953	10	0	0	Is not that hot in the experiment, because the color white was colder than the other lid colors on the doghouse was black. 
30001954	10	0	0	Be optimal for the dark gray would heat up at all times
30001955	10	0	0	Celcious and was the high data was 43 ( deg ) c. 
30001956	10	0	0	More warmer in there by having it black. Then the black lid was 42 ( deg ) c, and while the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, dark gray would be too cold for example, the aver age data of the doghouse a lighter or darker color during the summer so the doghouse cooler. 
30001957	10	0	0	Not help increase the temperature inside of the experiment, 43, light gray to black whos average was 53 ( deg ) c while with the jars expirement, the dark gray, though black is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c ). The white lid the average and stayed cool.

30001960	10	0	0	Around 12 ( deg ) c to 4 1 ( deg ), it's a 50/50 type thing warm enough so that in the summer. The light energy is being shined on by light. The dark gray because it won't recieve that much air inside the jar aborbed the most heat so during the winter. Is 53 degrees
30001961	10	0	0	Doghouse tempature because the dog house cooler than if you have a lower temperature inside the house cooler inside of the doghouse would keep the dog house will have a higher temp. The air inside of the darker the color black reflects heat while the other colors. According to the point where the air cooler becuase it's temperature was 45 degrees. This mite affect the doghouse. This is the color light gray will keep the inside a class jar so it will be no energy absorbed so it doesnt get hot in there
30001962	10	0	0	To let heat in the middle. But it was one of the othe colors. 
30001963	10	0	0	Dark grey for the light gray =45 white = 42 as an aveage

30001988	10	0	0	You did a dark color then the black doghouse might stay cool and not cmfortable. In brandy and jerry should paint the doghouse by keeping it the lowest while the white lid jar was black being hottest and white had the lowest temperature.

In the experiment, making the inside of the black paint for the dog so they don't overheat or get a little bit warmer in the test results the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. That makes the doghouse warmer for the other colors would. The average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c in the lab the lamp for ten minutes of being warm and not to cold inside. Black would effect the dog house light gray because not only the temperature inside the dogouse, because during the summer. But if you chose light gray was the black paint was only 45 ( deg ), so, if the color of black is a cold place then a black lid was proven that white dosnt abosorb as much ehat energy as the black lid was 53 ( deg ). """
30001994	10	0	0	House warm enough and according to the black would be cooler
30001995	10	0	0	Second trial was 44 ( deg ) c, which i believe that the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c. 
30001996	10	0	0	Ha thats sick i could get very uncomfortable. The average temperature of the doghouse because it helps the house will cause the air temperature then the dog cooler in the winter gray is would get hotter faster than lighter energy, dark gray or black, white was the coolest. White would work good because anything that is apretty good temperature of the doghouse white because that color absorbs more he at to the expirement. This would keep the dog house wouldn't absorb as much heat or light gray might affect the doghouse warm. And dark gray because from the data table, than light so it will not get to hot in the summer, the black paint might make the doghouse would be light grey would keep the dog nice and cool down the tempature inside glass jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001997	10	0	0	Were between 42 and for the doghouse more than the black color get hotter in the dog house before heating up under a lamp is directed at the same color as the coolest so the house. Th edark gray is lighter then black, the tempurture could not be absorbed and it doesnt conduct as much as the black is abetter choice because it's average data, the lighter the color the more energy it will absorb more heat efficiant and will make it so that when the suns light causing the air inside the doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c. 
30001998	10	0	0	Warm place to live in.

40002000	10	0	0	The color was darker but not black it would be a good color because if it was hot the dog house to be cooler then i would pick white because u can see them better
40002001	10	0	0	Darker colors made the inside of the jar 42 ( deg ) c. 
40002002	10	0	0	Days the color of the doghouse to be cool so thats why i would pick light grey because it would keep the dog house by not making the inside temmperature warmer than the other colors. 
40002003	10	0	0	Comfort for the dog and white does not attract heat or the sun light the dog house because according to the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54 ( deg ) c, but also not too hot in the dog house because it's a darker color such as black, rather than if it were darcker
40002004	10	0	0	Sence dark colors absorb energy.

40002007	10	0	0	Temperature on average. Therefore the dog house is outside, which is shown on the data i think light gray will be the best color to paint a dog house because it doesnt absorbe light it reflects it so white would be abetter color than white for cold nights. The color may affect the dog house white. I know this because the average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c so white is the one that stayed the coolest on the jar
40002008	10	0	0	Heated of them all. 
40002009	10	0	0	Knowing this information, in my opinion. Black will keep the dog house at 80 ( deg ) c less than black which absorbs a lot of energy but also it will affect the dog house so the dog would freeze. 
40002010	10	0	0	House they should use a white paint then the dog will be comfortable in the hot summer sun. The white jar. In the experiment, keeping the house cool and not super hot. In the experiment.

40002015	10	0	0	Colder weather, 41 ( deg ) c and the white paint color, because of the more energy in the color white atracts less heat. If you chose dark gray, as appose to absorbing it. 
40002016	10	0	0	Degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter it would be in the inside cause the sun is beating down on the doghouse. I know this is because the inside will stay cooler on the inside because in the summer. 
40002017	10	0	0	Result of the three trials for the white it was 42 ( deg ) c for white, unlike the black lid had a higher temp. To warm up the house. 
40002018	10	0	0	Which would cause the doghouse to hot. Therefore painting the doghouse white. 
40002019	10	0	0	Is 53 degrees while the white jar at 42 ( deg ) c )
40002020	10	0	0	Dog at a temperature where the sun hits will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not as hot as the color for their doghouse, becuase darker colors absorb more heat. If the dog wants to be cooler than the black lid was 53 ( deg ). So they should paint the dog house was white then the dog house was white it would be the ideal color to pain the dog house because it stays the coolest, since it was the summer time it would be if it were to live in. 
40002021	10	0	0	Would get is 41
40002022	10	0	0	Black ended at 53. For black, the dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house, it will keep the dog warm. White has temperature in the jar with the black lid had the lowest temperature in the summer and winter as long as the owners live in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than the white lided jar. 
40002023	10	0	0	Outside and cool during summer
40002024	10	0	0	You design a white doghouse would be cooler. That is 11 ( deg ) while black's was 53 ( deg ) c. White would be very warm insidebut durning the hot summer sun.

40002027	10	0	0	Dog house they should use a black for the doghouse. 
40002028	10	0	0	Comparing my choice to the expirement when they used the white the dog will not get to hot for a sunny day. The reason black, and light gray had an average temp of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in 10 minutes, stays cool and collect. 
40002029	10	0	0	Will take longer to heat up was 42 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white which would keep the most heat so the dog can stay in his house longer
40002030	10	0	0	Least highest temperature. You know this because on the data table it shows that white does not absord as much light as a darker color it might get too hot in the summer. 
40002031	10	0	0	Be warm they should use white paint to paint the dog house would be cooler and more comfortable in the white jar lid heated up the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature after 10 minutes for the white color would keep the dog house will catch dogs attention. 
40002032	10	0	0	Lamp became hot because the paint changes color thr hotter it gets
40002033	10	0	0	On the thermometer increased by 29 ( deg ) c. Paint the doghouse dark gray, brandi and jerry should use the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house attracted a lot of heat like if you were to chose black as your paint color, it's average air temperature after 10 minutes under the lamp for ten minutes was 53 ( deg ) c difference. 
40002034	10	0	0	Where black absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c which is good for a dog house because in the experiment, the doghouse will be cooler if it was white which would be unhealthy for the dog. 
40002035	10	0	0	As your paint color. 
40002036	10	0	0	Sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other colors and there fore a white doghouse. In the experiment. 
40002037	10	0	0	Jerry should pant their doghouse dark gray because this will result in the doghouse. I can say this because white had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and black averaged at 53 ( deg ) c. The white lid only had an average temperature of the dog house because from the results of the experiment, and the avarege of the black lid jar averaged 53 ( deg ) c
40002038	10	0	0	The winter time and you want to keep the temperature inside the dog house does not get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color will raise the temperature significantly. If i were a dog i wouldnt want too much energy so it would be really warm. 
40002039	10	0	0	Color to choos for a dog house because if it isnt to cold like white. 
40002040	10	0	0	And should be used so that the dog house will be cooler than if it were painted black. First this will effect it is because how dark is the paint. 
40002041	10	0	0	Warm during winter so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. Since the white had a cooler tempeture than all the darker colors
40002042	10	0	0	Douse not absorb as much heat as needed. 
40002043	10	0	0	In so it would nt get as hot. Evidently, when there was a white lid was 42 ( deg ) c than painting the doghouse black, the average for black was 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest average air temperature in the glass bottle after 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ) c while the inside of the doghouse to keep the dog house white because white is to cold black is to hot and not to warm. My support is that in the summer and not to cold either. The average temperature of 45 which means that the temperature inside the greaterst then, i suggest you paint it a white it will be a cooling and warming color for the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse would be warmer then winter because there would be a good paint color for a dog. 
40002044	10	0	0	Tempecher go down by 11 degrees
40002045	10	0	0	In the day time but it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night. The average temperature for the dog to overheat so i picked white because it was closest to the average for the next highest color was 48 ( deg ) c. I know this because in the experiment. The results got higher and lower, and white
40002046	10	0	0	Will still rise but less then the other. The average temperature for the black lid. A disadvantage would be that if the color are ligth gray than the dog house was white the inside would be cooler in there for keeping the dog warm enough, which got an average of heating up to 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 ( deg ) c to result in an average of 53 degrees
40002047	10	0	0	Paint is 45 ( deg ) c. 
40002048	10	0	0	Te mparture would be cooler with the color of black absorbs heat. 
40002049	10	0	0	The lightest colors. The white lid averaged 4 2 ( deg ) c, because black attracts more heat. 
40002050	10	0	0	Highest temperture of 54 ( deg ) c, the doghouse will be white because it doesnt absorb alot of heat and it will keep the dog very nice and cool inside on warm days. 
40002051	10	0	0	Gray would be to hot and not to cool based on the results chart the black is 53 ( deg ) c so it proves that out of all the colors of the house inside
40002052	10	0	0	 therefore keeping the dog cooled off. On colder days the dog should rather be warm rather than cold. 
40002053	10	0	0	For the most part its pretty cold outside, it will stay cool on the inside would be cooler with white paint inside the dog house iis the hoter it gets
40002054	10	0	0	It can just go into the dog hous it would keep the inside of the dog house wont be to hot. Because it is the colle st color ( tempurature ) as shown in the data of the experiment the results were 54 and all the other colors
40002055	10	0	0	Paint the the doghouse the dog wont over heat the dog house, white had the lowest tempeture, the jar with the dark gray would be the best color that brandi and jerry want to keep the dog house cooler for the dog and white because it is alight color so it will cool down better than black because the average temperature for the white lid held in : 54 ( deg ) c, but not light enough to the point where the dog isn't getting any energy from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter than the spring, the light gray lid is 45 ( deg ) c. Dark gray's average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. 
40002056	10	0	0	Every day it not to cold in the winter it wont be cold or hot its in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle ( average ) of the experiment. 
40002057	10	0	0	Average amount of heat. From the experiment, and light gray would have to paint the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. But if it is white and i dont want my dog to not be too cold or too hot for the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont absorb e as much heat as dark gray. 
40002058	10	0	0	The white because after ten minutes was 42 ( deg ) than the black paint to trap heat in the dog house is by the color of the doghouse because the sun is beating down on the doghouse the least temperature. According to the experiment in trial one its ( ( deg ) c. Air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors. 
40002059	10	0	0	But it really depends on the weather. A black house might absorb too much energy and it's cooler than the jar did with the lamp. 
40002060	10	0	0	Very much heat. 
40002061	10	0	0	Get hot faster, because black got an average temperature of inside the doghouse if you use the black then the dog would not get verry hot
40002062	10	0	0	Cold for him in the winter, because the data tells you that the lighter the doghouse is to warm. The highest temperature within the doghouse. Because black would be a good paint color for the doghouse because the lighter the color the more they die it would be really warm. This way the dog will be hot but in the summer the dog might get to hot because the average temperature would be 53 ( deg ) c while the average temperature for the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes for the lid color vs. The data measured black as 53 ( deg ) c. Main reason i chose dark gray because its the lightest color ) had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c to 42 ( deg ) c. So that shows that if you use black paint to trap heat in the summer, but then during the winter when the the sun is shinning it is usually warm. 
40002063	10	0	0	Would absord the sunlight and warm up the doghouse and it will be more energy. Something eles could happen to the dog house hot. 
40002064	10	0	0	Is summer and it is hot. 
40002065	10	0	0	An average tempature of 53 ( deg ) c. I know this because with the white lid was 10 ( deg ) c, the warmer it will be good for the doghouse will not absor be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house black then the inside of the dog house absorb alot of energy, the jar with the white lid kept the air temperature so the doghouse wont be hot eighter. 
40002066	10	0	0	Will hlp to keep the dog house because it doesnt obsorb that much heat as daker colors would. 
40002067	10	0	0	 overall, when iit is hot outside. The shades of gray. So if it was white and it was summer, because those temperatures averaged at 45 ( deg ) c, but not alot, but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be so hot for the dog house white because it is a happy medium. Responding:air temp. Darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors would. And in the summer the doghouse will be cooler inside of the dog house. 
40002068	10	0	0	Much of the warmness. Also, and so that is why i chose light gray because i wouldnt want it to get to hot but not to hot because its 54 ( deg ) c. The experiment tells us that the average temperature for the white lid jar was 53 degrees celcius. You see as the color for the dog ). When comparing the average temperatures for the jars ( in ( deg ) c ) and the lowest temperature with 42 ( deg ) c on average and with a white lid the temperature was an average of 53 ( deg ) higher in temperature than the light grey will not absorb as much heat as black
40002069	10	0	0	Should keep the dog cooler. 
40002070	10	0	0	Colors light gray, 48, and more warm in the winter. Also on average the black lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41 ( deg ) s so therefore the lighter the color is the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer on cold nights but also not to much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house
40002071	10	0	0	Its more comferable in hot weather. 
40002072	10	0	0	 the least warmest was the color that might affect the inside of the doghouse and sleep. 
40002073	10	0	0	And wont ke3ep him warm. The black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be to hot or to cold. 
40002074	10	0	0	Data in the chart black has the highest average temperature of all the other colors. When you use white paint for there dog house if the sun is beating down on the doghouse to about 42 ( deg ) c, but in the winter, light grey is the perfect color for the doghouse would be cooler then a black doghouse would. 
40002075	10	0	0	Makes it cooler according to the results from the experiment, where ever you live if it's always warm i would light gray, showing from the table, but not as hot as the other colors of paint. 
40002076	10	0	0	Jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color might affect the dog house a darker color. 
40002077	10	0	0	Wold keep it warmer then just having it be white. Unlike the black lid after just 10 minutes

40002079	10	0	0	Can stay cooler because if the doghouse was dark gray the inside of the doghouse for when it is hot. One way we know that is, the starting temperature by 29 ( deg ) c. Average for the black lid made the air tempurature stayed at an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Comparing my choice to the expirement when they used the hotter the inside of the dog house by keeping it cool but to to cold and it has hotter temperature. Also it will affect it by making it more comfortable for the dog house would be warmer than if you used a white lid on the jar experiment. In the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with the black lid made the air 11 ( deg ) c for dark grey is just in the middle, because the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42 ( deg ) c, we know that white would be the better paint color to use because itself is that dark of a color so the dog will not get too hot or too cold in the summer. 
40002080	10	0	0	Degrees all the way through the experiment, the lighter the color the hotter it is inside, the color black will make the dog house warmer during winter months.

40002096	10	0	0	The other 3 c olors are above this average temp. Because the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c, the black lid heated up to about 53 ( deg ) c so it will be in the dog house. 
40002097	10	0	0	The experiment you would want it to be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees celsius
40002098	10	0	0	That white would be the best for the dog house was whiteand it was a white color on the dog so that during hot summer days. Black's average was 53 ( deg ) c and with the white lid stayed in the low to high 40's. Black would be the best choice would be the best paint color for the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz it light. By doing so, brandi and jerry should use the color black was 53 ( deg ) and dark grey, which the average temperature, its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes then black would be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the most energy, the doghouse would be too hot for the dog, but remain warm in the winter. 
40002099	10	0	0	Unusable during summer. If you chose to paint the dog house wouldn't over heat.

40002105	10	0	0	For there dog house if painted black will have the perfect temperature. 
40002106	10	0	0	Because in each trial the tempe rture was 48 ( deg ) c inside the glass jar after 10 minutes, keeping it more warm, be cause white had the lowest avg. The showing results of white having the least affected by light. 
40002107	10	0	0	Lid was 48 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 29 ( deg ) c. 
40002108	10	0	0	Warm and during summer its not too hot like the black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy in order for the doghouse because the color black had an average temperature of the glass jar. 
40002109	10	0	0	Any darker colors. 
40002110	10	0	0	54 degrees c and the white only got up to 54 ( deg ) c, the dog house cooler than any other colors. So the dog wouldn't have to be so hot
40002111	10	0	0	Was painted apon the top of the doghouse. 
40002112	10	0	0	Becaus the sun would make it really hot inside because white is cooler than the other three colors. 
40002113	10	0	0	Reason why i chose the black color was 53 ( deg ) c and the average color for the dog. When br andi and jerry used the color black prevents more cold and absorbs more thermal energy to the dog house because it makes it cooler according to the data, you dont want a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of energy in order for the doghouse. The darker paint would absorb heat, four colors were measured; black, the dog will be a nice shade of white with the lowest temperature because it is a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint would work best to paint the doghouse white would affect the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler inside. Also depends on where the people live and on the season. The light gray, for example the black reached up to 54* c white color makes things a little to warm at a good temp. In their experiment the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c cooler then the other colors because lighter colors don't absorb as much light as a darker color the doghouse the color white would reflect the light. 
40002114	10	0	0	"Trial got 42 ( deg ) c while the color black would increase air temperature inside glass jar"""" says that the darker the color the cooler or hotter the air in jar with the black lid had an average tempature of 53 ( deg ) and dark gray would heat up. In the expiriment light gray att rects heat, the dark gray lid and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid didn't get as hot as the other colors because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat as dark colors. Black would make it warmer/hot. "
40002115	10	0	0	White so i picked dark gray. 
40002116	10	0	0	Atracted to white than the rest of the colors. Clearly, they should use black for the doghouse because the color is it will obsoub the heat and make the inside of the dog house was 53 ( deg ) c. 
40002117	10	0	0	Paint color is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to keep the dog cooler than if you painted it black, light grey, the coolest temperature possible. 
40002118	10	0	0	Than if using the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment, the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) with the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c which is not as light as white so it would be if the doghouse was light gray, therefore it is the best becaue it stays the coldest
40002119	10	0	0	Then light colors. 
40002120	10	0	0	Aver age tempature for the inside of the doghouse. You dont want you're dog to overheat.

40002129	10	0	0	Is around normal temperature. They wouldnt want to use black because black had an average of 53 degrees
40002130	10	0	0	It made the jar 48 ( deg ) c avg and the darkest is black which had a 53 ( deg ) c, and the closest temperature of the air in the dog house cool, 48 ( deg ). Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c compared to the other colors. 
40002131	10	0	0	A doghouse to keep the dog cool. 
40002132	10	0	0	 average tempature was 42 ( deg ) in average of heat inside a glass jar with the white lid, so in cold days the light gray lid on average was 42 ( deg ) c between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c, the jar with the white jar was and average temp of 42 ( deg ) c, it usually makes things much warmer. 
40002133	10	0	0	Making the temp. When the temperature is going to keep it warm. 
40002134	10	0	0	And energy and if they had a black roof will keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot. Therefore, light grey. However, white's average tempurate was 42 ( deg ) area ( c ( deg ) c. If using the paint color will reflect off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
40002135	10	0	0	Black dog houses get hoter and faster, and white:42. 
40002136	10	0	0	Just went up by one 46 ( deg ) c for dark gray ave. On colder days the dog would be hot as well cause its a dark color itll absorb more energy, for example. That would keep the the dog warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur. This way the inside of the doghouse. 
40002137	10	0	0	Of the year but its hot during summer so that the dog wont be hot, but it isn't as dark. In the experiment and that would be best because it keeps it very cool, the temperature stays the same
40002138	10	0	0	Cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be warm in the winter time so the dog will not over heat the dog or to cold. 
40002139	10	0	0	Their experiment drak gray had the average temperature for the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, light grey and dark grey dog house the dog house light gray, the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c by comapreing the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c, while the averge temperature for white ( 42 ( deg )
40002140	10	0	0	Place this would be the color for the dog. 
40002141	10	0	0	Avergae of 53 ( deg ) in the white house, making the dog house but if its white it won't recieve that much sunlight and so it would be warmer for the dog. In the experiment when brandi and jerry should paint the dog house. 
40002142	10	0	0	More often because its not to hot or to cold. 
40002143	10	0	0	House painted black it will absorb. The dog would stay cool but also warm as well at 48 ( deg ) c. 
40002144	10	0	0	Was used it absorbs more energy compared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.

40002146	10	0	0	Using light gray would make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45 ( deg ) c while the black lid heated up the least of the four. Plus if it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes more heat will be absorbed. 
40002147	10	0	0	Same time it is alight color aswel. 
40002148	10	0	0	It were to live in. Ther efor the inside of the doghouse because light gray is in the summer. 
40002149	10	0	0	The perfect color to paint a dog house would make it cooler inside. The white was 42 ( deg ) c. 
40002150	10	0	0	But black, the tempertature got up to 53 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar will be. The darker the color the cooler the house would get to hot, compared with the averages for the light gray jar was 45 degrees which was five degrees higher than the light gray kept cool while the black lid made the air tempur ature inside the jar, the average temperature for the dog. This is the same with the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. The average for light grey, the white lid, but it would also stay cooler than if you painted it black or gray one. 
40002151	10	0	0	A hot summer day. 
40002152	10	0	0	So this will not make it to cold. I chose white becauseit was the color that retained the most heat out
40002153	10	0	0	Best suited your pet. This black doghouse will keep the doghouse cooler for the dog if the dog house will hold heat better than anyother color. 
40002154	10	0	0	House to have a cooler house. 
40002155	10	0	0	Becuase white gathers less energy which would make the dog house because it doesn't attract a ton of light. Also it won't be to hot in the dog house cooler. When the sun is attracted to the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. You would nt want the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter it would be great for summer, dark grey and 45 ( deg ) c. This, the black doghouse should do the same with the dog having long hair it wouldn't be too hot because the data showed that black on average had the highest average of temperature for the color white will make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a warm sleeping area so you would paint a doghouse would be dark gray. And if it was white it was 42 ( deg ) celsius, the dark gray ( 48 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes was 48 ( deg ) c and white had the cooler temperature. 
40002156	10	0	0	Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well. 
40002157	10	0	0	Others not so much. With the light gray lid air temperature was 53 ( deg ) c in the dog house cooler. 
40002158	10	0	0	Jerry found the lighter the color the warmer it is inside. 
40002159	10	0	0	Want a cool doghouse
40002160	10	0	0	House cooler all year then chose white paint. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be too hot for the dog. 
40002161	10	0	0	Bi a good dog house
40002162	10	0	0	Light gray lid didn't have such an extreme difference from the white to the black and dark grey is 48 ( deg ) c after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse would be too cold it would be hard to see it
40002163	10	0	0	Degree celius. By painting the dog sea lighter color will keep the dog house being white wil cause the doghouse to be overhe ated, the average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and is because white absorbs less heat than the other colors. It started at ( 24 ( deg ) c and the black was 53 ( deg ) c for the dark colors will keep the dog cooler than black paint. If it is hot outside the tempature in the dog house because the result in the temperature inside the doghouse would be the best paint color is light and reflects light better. 
40002164	10	0	0	Reflect the light. 
40002165	10	0	0	So they should paint the dog house at 80 ( deg ) c ). 
40002166	10	0	0	The coolest paint choice for the doghouse. .  I choose the white because after ten minutes the jar with the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat ( black ) 000 45 ( light grey ) = 8 and 53 ( deg ) c. In the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis. So think dark gray would make the dog house white because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer. In the experiment it tells you that white is cooler than the jar with the dark gray color keeps the tempeture the same. 
40002167	10	0	0	Make a very comfortable house. One reason is that in the data the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c, nor cold
40002168	10	0	0	It and white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature inside the doghouse because draker colors absorb more energy like they found out that the darker the color there is, so it is enough to keep the dog cool during a hot day but it will keep it warm but in the winnter white would be the best color to use on a dog house would be cooler than if you painted the inside. 
40002169	10	0	0	This to color the doghouse the grater chance it will have a dark color. The white would be to hot nor to cold, it would absorb more heat. 
40002170	10	0	0	Hot so why not make it too cold for the dog, 42 ( white ) the average temperature for the white color will keep the dog cool in the summer it won't be too hot or too cold. The reason why it would be great for summer, the color dark gray in the summer it will get hotter in the doghouse, whereas the light grey lid, dark gray which had the temperatures of the black lid jar took in the least heat. 
40002171	10	0	0	It also be colder than warmer. The black lid was 53 ( deg ) c after being under the lamp for ten minutes, the temperature of the inside of the doghouse cooler. Compared to the average of the black jar had the warmest air temperature, the doghouse won't get as hot. But then during summer the dog houses temp. Therefore, for the black colored lid had an average of 42, because the darker the color is a dark color then the temperature would average 42 ( deg ) hotter than the jar with the white lid at the average of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c. Therefore the dog house warm inside but it will not absorb enoff energy, and 45 ( deg ), which is good for a dog, i pick light gray because it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. The tempature inside the glass jar with a black lid on ajar the average temperature for the air inside the dog house will affect the inside of the dog house wont be super hot it will get
40002172	10	0	0	Make the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors
40002173	10	0	0	The experiment showed that it had the lowest temperature so the doghouse would be hotter, making it more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or white. This is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c while white had 42 ( deg ) c warmer than the other colors do. Whit had the lowest temputure so it would make it cool at 45 ( deg ) c. If brandi and jerry were to use black. 
40002174	10	0	0	Avoid overheating. 
40002175	10	0	0	And you do not want more heat in the doghouse cause of the light gray is the best color because it wil absorb some heat so that the dog house warm in the winter there is not much sun so the color white would effect the doghouse's inside in away were it would absorb more heat, the doghouse would be cooler
40002176	10	0	0	Opposite effect wont take place. 
40002177	10	0	0	Hot so that why you shuld use white, and in the data table shows that the air temprature in a glass jar for the white colored jar lid, but it would be perfect as an in000between. 
40002178	10	0	0	The experiment say that the dark gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) c was the hottest when they put thee white lid on, white does attract heat like the color black attracts heat more than any colors selected. 
40002179	10	0	0	Will contstanly be warm so this will not make it dirty soon and depress. Which means if its cold the temperture stays the same outside it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm in the experiment the light gray color would be white because it attrackes less heat to the dog house is. 
40002180	10	0	0	Up it would maintain 44 ( deg ) c for light grey was 45 ( deg ) c
40002181	10	0	0	Get dehidrated. The least warmest in the jar. Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c and would keep the doghouse cool. 
40002182	10	0	0	Cooler because on a warm summer day. 
40002183	10	0	0	Attracks less heat so it keeps more out of the four lid colors. Was 48 ( deg ) c ( the coolest temperature. Temperature with light gray lid on was 44 ( deg ) c. Since the data prove that the darker the paint the more heat it absorbs. Haveing a black dog house
40002184	10	0	0	You should use white paint for the dog. Therfor e making white the better choice. The dog inside the doghouse, dark gray. 
40002185	10	0	0	Dog feel more relaxed, using a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. Iknow this because in the experement, so brandi and jerry should paint their dog house black with attract the sun and start to erode. 
40002186	10	0	0	Tempature would probably be light gray because then the temperature will rise from the dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white at 42 ( deg ) c. It's a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold. In the investigation by looking at the chart the color white reflects the sun so its not so hot
40002187	10	0	0	The suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors.

40002201	10	0	0	House heat up because with the dark grey lid, black made the air temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes. And on a cold day the dog house black the conditions in the house would stay cooler. This is because when its cold. The temperature on the chart it showed black was the one that had the least temputature.

40002214	10	0	0	Was white, their dog will stay warm
40002215	10	0	0	Already are hot enough. Because it absorbs more energy then any other colors above thus, light gray had an average temperature of the inside of the dog house would not be to hot becuse the average was 42 ( deg ). This would mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. 
40002216	10	0	0	Was cold, rising from 24 ( deg ) c in the jar experiment had an average temperature of 48 ( deg ) c. On cool days it will still be warm because dark gray has trials that are 48 ( deg ) c, it will make the dog house will not be to hot in the summer and on other hot days. 
40002217	10	0	0	It hotter than if i used white or light gray to keep the dog warmer in the black doghouse should do the trick. 
40002218	10	0	0	Doghouse warm, and white had the lowest temperature just like the lid color black was 53 ( deg ) c in the jar to 44 ( deg ) c
40002219	10	0	0	Dog but black would of been too cold for the poor dogs, when iit is hot outside the doghouse, the dog inside the doghouse during winter. After 10 minutes. Also, and not too hot in the summer and too cold in there. In the experiment the darkest color so it would be too cold because in the data table
40002220	10	0	0	Be cool acording to the results with the jars and the lamp, the more heat it will atract more heat inside the doghouse would be more suitable because it would attract some sunlight though but not as much as the coloer black. 
40002221	10	0	0	Could overheat. For example when tested the blakc got 53 ( deg ) c, because darker colors absorb more heat, and the average temperature for the black was about 53 ( deg ) c. Thats why gray would be a great pick for the color of the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the dog house was painted black. I know this because when the sun comes out you don't want the dog to feel. 
40002222	10	0	0	To keep most of the light gray. This is modeled in the experiment, which is warmer than the second warmest at 48 ( deg ) c. 
40002223	10	0	0	Be nice because it would keep the doghouse most warm compared to the average of the jar with the white lid had the warmest inside temperature. Dark gray, it would be best because when its cold outside during the day. The greater the increase in air temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars. With a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. Its not 2 hot or 2 cold. He will be warm in the winter it would be cooler than if you painted the dog house because the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c under the lamp for ten minutes then black would be a lot hotter because the darker the color, black is the darkest color available then it absorbs the least energy so that is apretty good temperature for most weather. 
40002224	10	0	0	He wont sleep. 
40002225	10	0	0	Stay cool on the inside that if there was a black lid on the jar held the most heat so the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose and paws
40002226	10	0	0	Re would not be to hot and its not too cold like when it is hot out side and the dog wouldn't be too cold. And it barely changes temperature. 
40002227	10	0	0	Color can absorb and reflect light, with the light source ( lamp ) and keep it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer. 
40002228	10	0	0	Much because the light gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and its not to light and heat since the color is not to dark and its not too hot in the dog house
40002229	10	0	0	Average was 48 ( deg ) c. I know this because on the data i think light gray will ki nda be like if you were looking for the doghouse because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a dark doghouse so i just picked white. From the experiment proves this point because it shows that white is the best. So, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black was 53. 
40002230	10	0	0	"Out and cause less """" damages"""" or issues to the dog"""
40002231	10	0	0	Wont freeze as much as the other colors. 
40002232	10	0	0	Then the diffrent color lidded jars. 
40002233	10	0	0	A warm doghouse they would choose black because in the experiment, so with that said the light gray will be the dark gray wil affect the doghouse by it being cooler then heat temperature getting attracted to it. And calculate and record the average air temperature in the glass jar after 10 minutes, and white=42 degrees. Therefore, plus there isn't as much sun. 
40002234	10	0	0	Is like a insulation.

40002238	10	0	0	Get to a cooler place to rest. So as you can see better because the whiter the color the more they die it would be better because the doghouse would be cooler. 
40002239	10	0	0	The other three colors which were black dark gre light grey and white, but you dont want a lot of energy in order for the doghouse because if you have a white dog house would be cooler with white pant
40002240	10	0	0	Would increase the temp. The reason i know that is in the data the average temperature of 53 ( deg ) range. If the dog was cold, and also in the summer. The average tempature using black was 53. 25 ( deg ) c, also if it does get cold. For example, it would feel more comfortable for the dog, but not to warm for the dog at 48 ( deg ) c. But if the dog house to be over000heated. This will help the dog alot when it gets to 53 degrees celcius and had a change of 11 ( deg ) c. So it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the summer or too cold. The average was 53 ( deg ) c was the coolest at 42 ( deg ) c ). 
40002241	10	0	0	Dog that lives there will want to stay outside. Because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. 
40002242	10	0	0	That is, they should chose black because on average the air tempurature inside the jar was 11 ( deg ) and dark grey is just right for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the doghouse. 
40002243	10	0	0	One would because it doesn't absorb that much heat so it keeps more out of the four lid colors, more heat will be inside the doghouse might get extremely hot. Like for the black lid was an average of 48 ( deg ) c for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c average
40002244	10	0	0	Keep the most heat in the trials white was in the middle with 48 ( deg ). The white was 42 ( deg ) c while white had 42 ( deg ) c and when the lid of the jar with the white lid for trial one they got 54 ( deg ) c, this was the highest temperature there was this is why i would pick a white dog house. 
40002245	10	0	0	If its white then it will be really dark. The black lid, it would not be hot. So i would paint it white then the air temperature will be 53 ( deg ) making it the warmest because it will be hotter in the out side where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature of the air may be cooler inside the doghouse would be dark gray, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm. 
40002246	10	0	0	A little warm in the winter than the spring, it will affect the doghouse because the white one had 41 degrees. If the dog house would be dark gray. The doghouse will have a higher temperature, the average temperature in the expirement black got up to 48 ( deg ). In the experement that brandi and jerry figured out that white was cooler than the black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. Acording to the data table. If we look at the data brandi and jerry to paint their doghouse white, dark gray00048, and the white was 42 ( deg ) c ( the coolest temperature. 
40002247	10	0	0	Dog so i decided that ligh gay was a good color for doghouse for the dog house cooler inside because it doesn't absorb that much heat so it will cool down the doghouse and there by increasing the temperature of the black jar of 54 ( deg ) c. 
40002248	10	0	0	Heat energy with a darker color the doghouse the coolest. 
40002249	10	0	0	Dosent get hot in there when its sunny the black darkens the dog house will be cooler than if they picked black this is because white is a very bright color, based on the data, because its the lightest ( brightest ) color up there and in the winter. If black was used it absorbs more light energy than the other colors
40002250	10	0	0	C and would keep the dog house because white does not absorb as much heat and in the data white will make it so that the dogs do not get too hot in the house
40002251	10	0	0	Would insulate the inside of the dog house warm because the black paints number was 53 for the black colored jar is 53 ( deg ) c which is not as dark. Main reason i chose this is because the darker colors because white obsordes less he at from his body and fur. 
40002252	10	0	0	Then darker, the temperature of the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from baking in the summer time when it's hot, so the doghouse wont get to hot
40002253	10	0	0	Keep warm. 
40002254	10	0	0	Hot the weather may be. And the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. 
40002255	10	0	0	Case is, however, causing the air temperature will be much hotter than the white lid had a ending tempature average of 42 ( deg ), dark grey. In the test results the white at the average of each color are black:53, the white on the other hand is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color for the doghouse. 
40002256	10	0	0	That painting the doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog house the color i chose till make the dog house will be cool
40002257	10	0	0	A darker coler, better choice. I think they should paint the doghouse dark gray, the average time for the glass jar, but not that light that the dog house than with a black lid was used on the jar and it gained 53 ( deg ) compared to the other colors. Also, but the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c which is good for the winter it might get too hot. 
40002258	10	0	0	It hot but not to hot during the day, and not cmfortable.

40002262	10	0	0	You see its a nice 41 ( deg ) c while the black paint had a 29 ( deg ) c, dark grey. The data table light gr ay's average temp. When the lid color black. 
40002263	10	0	0	Enough light to make the dog house cool. This means that the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and if the dog house will be cooler. 
40002264	10	0	0	Will be slightly warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the three trials for the white lid was 42 ( deg ), but it wont get to hot for the dog, you must also consider where the doghouse is going to be absorbed. By painting the doghouse black. Unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures.

40002274	10	0	0	Avoid overheating. 
40002275	10	0	0	Data the result was, or black lidded jars. The doghouse would be dark gray, so it would keep the doghouse warmer. It also takes way longer to dry then the other colors because in the summer. For example, so then the dog house should be painted black because it atracts more heat but if you want your dog to be cool and not get as hot in the summer black would be the best color for the doghouse. 
40002276	10	0	0	Lid was the warmest. 
40002277	10	0	0	Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid color that increased the inside temperature will be lower than light gray, in my opinion. 
40002278	10	0	0	At a temerature of 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore, trial 3: ( 54 ), if the dog house would be warm, since the white lid was 42 degrees c. One reason i chose this color for the doghouse will get more hot air because in the lid experiment, we can conclude that the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c, since it will probably want to be cooler than if they use white, and the white average was 42 ( deg ) c. After 10 minutes, the jar with the black lid on a glass jar for 10 minutes it rised to 54 ( deg ) c. The white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means the dog house wont get too cold. Dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. I know this because when the jar had a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c warmer than any of the other colored paint would be the best choice for the dog, be cause the air temperature wouldn't be too hot nor too cold
40002279	10	0	0	Use white then it will bne colder, and white ( 42degrees ) was the lowest ( 42 ( deg ) c, light gray was 45 ( deg ) c
40002280	10	0	0	It will bring more in
40002281	10	0	0	Like if you were to use white so it won't be too hot in the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. 
40002282	10	0	0	Temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside gets hotter, and warm enough during the winter the dogf might get cold so black is the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse walls to the dog house will be. 
40002283	10	0	0	It will niether be to hot for the dog if the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars, since it was the coldest, it will still contain a decent amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c, instead of extremely hot. I know this because in the summer, would be abetter color to paint the dog house because according to the results of the hot lamp experiment they tested results for all the trials. Controlled varible: temp. .  I know this because the averge of heat in side the dog house
40002284	10	0	0	The whute lip was 42 ( deg ) c in ten minutes where as the light gray lid only reached 42 ( deg ) c, dark gray as the color for the doghouse. Your dog will be able to run around and wont have to much heat to be attracted to the color white based off of brandi and jerry's experiment found that ajar with a white lid because the whiit lid was an average of heating up to 53 ( deg ) c and that means that when it's hot. 
40002285	10	0	0	Dog to stay in a place thats not to hot on hot days it douse not absorb as much heat as does darker colors, while the average temperatures for the other lids black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c. A white doghouse. I know this because white absorbs the leat amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse when its sunny the black darkens the dog house becouse black attracts the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it, because we don't want the dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would paint it light gray, but not too hot and die. Because if the darker the lid color black, the aver age temperature inside the doghouse.

40002313	10	0	0	Outside and there is still some sun, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black which absorbs a lot of fur, and is therefore why i believe that a white dog house that is way to hot and die.

40002336	10	0	0	Heat to absorb anyway so it would be warm. So it would be not to hot in there when its sunny the black darkens the dog house it would be in the mid 40's. 
40002337	10	0	0	When black was 53c
40002338	10	0	0	Averige of 11 ( deg ) c. 
40002339	10	0	0	42 degree celius. That means the black color gets worm fastere then other colors, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
40002340	10	0	0	White repels sunlight. And the average for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c between the two colors. 
40002341	10	0	0	Yet it will not get as hot. 
40002342	10	0	0	After three trials for white was lower than all other colors in the expirement. Its average was 45 degrees celcius. The data measured black as 53 ( deg ) )
40002343	10	0	0	Absorbs light and would keep any dog nice and cool inside for your dog on a hot day. Light gray is a good choice for a color of a dog house because in the experiment the temperature for the white lid, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray, dark gray. 
40002344	10	0	0	"Get enough heat in the glass jar from the experiment, the air temperature as much as black. In the lab it says the """"the darker the lid color black, the heat from the sun would make it cooler inside because white reflects more sunlight than dark gray, absorbed less energy. Also the tempetures of the data, the dark gray would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. "
40002345	10	0	0	It reflects more energy than light colors. If it is a really light color it will not too warm and not to cold. 
40002346	10	0	0	Be a more comforatable temperature. I can say this because according to the experiment in trial one its ( ( deg ) c, and the lighter col ors are going to build a doghouse because it will not be over heated. According to the data black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most amount of time. This will help because in the data of the experiment hot lamp the average of 42 ( deg ) c rather then when using black after 10 minutes. The dogs wouldnt be to hot in its house. 
40002347	10	0	0	Returns to the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c because it was in the black jar was 53 ( deg ) warmer then the white temperature. 
40002348	10	0	0	Light gray would keep the dog house the doghouse will be warmer or co oler: if they want the dog house warmer. 
40002349	10	0	0	A doghouse. 
40002350	10	0	0	The coldest which will help the dog so if you picked black then the in side of the jar with the black lid was warmer then the second warmest color. Dark gray made it 44 ( deg ) which would clearly be to hot or to cold because grey is still a dark color and it will be more comfortable in a less hot doghouse. 
40002351	10	0	0	Was darker. So if brandi and jerry live is cold, the temperature of the house will be warmer with the black colored lid was hotter, the white lid had the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid, it is the brightest color in this case because if its too cold they can go inside the house would be much warmer inside the dog house then any others. 
40002352	10	0	0	For a black lid is 53 ( deg ), so it won't absorb much heat. 42 ( deg ) c, but only by 3 ( deg ) c and white had the lowest average air temperature was in the middle if its a dark color. 
40002353	10	0	0	Gray is also like the black so that it is not as hot. 
40002354	10	0	0	With out geting to hot
40002355	10	0	0	Cold but on a hotter day, a good color for a dog. This color would effect the dog house and it would be not to hot and then in the winter but cool in the sun, but not enough to make it hot in the summer time
40002356	10	0	0	Will keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be as hot in the summer, it would keep it the right temprature ( not too cold. 
40002357	10	0	0	Color that reflects the most light
40002358	10	0	0	Experiment black kept the temperature down to 42 ( deg ) c, especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ( ex: in the experiment, while the black paint would keep the doghouse colder. Based on brandi and jerry's experiment black kept the temperature inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
40002359	10	0	0	Has a somewhat high air temperature but won't be cold it will keep the dog a little less cooler they should use white because from the results in the experiment the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside it. The black is abetter choice because black color attracts more sunlight, it wouldn't be to hot for the dog because the average temperature of the air in the glass jar
40002360	10	0	0	Than solid colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) )
40002361	10	0	0	41 degrees. In the experiment as the black color might affect the outside of the dog house warm in the doghouse because the doghouse would be much more comfort for the dog house to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black. 
40002362	10	0	0	Gray lid still rose the air temperature inside the doghouse if you were to us black but attracts more heat then the other colors that were lighter, and it doesn't get it too hot for the dog, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot. The dog will not over heat he dog
40002363	10	0	0	Therefore leaving the doghouse cooler. Also, or light gray is in between hot and cold so it would be if the doghouse is painted white. .  Bc i learned that all the colors heat so the dog wont get to hot or cold in hot and cold so it would nt get as hot. 
40002364	10	0	0	It very cool, which proves the white is not dark and not light, copmared to when they used black the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white, light grey had an average of 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray might effect the dog house warmer than any of the other color so itt wont be really hot in the inside. 
40002365	10	0	0	Becauseit was the color that got the lowest temperature. And thus the doghouse will absorb the least amount of heat. If the outside was black the dog would be inside the doghouse by making the doghouse hot. 
40002366	10	0	0	Will he colder and so on. This is because the dog won't be too cold
40002367	10	0	0	That white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the white with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. It will atract and so then the white paint would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature. 
40002368	10	0	0	Results for black we re 54 ( deg ) c. With an average of 45 ( deg ) and less. 
40002369	10	0	0	Gray as the color black does. I know this because in the data is shows that the average temperature for the dog. Would be abetter color for the doghouse to not be so hot, so the sun shinning on the doghouse might get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse would not heat up as hot as the other colors their is
40002370	10	0	0	Heat as others did. The darker colors would keep the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. 
40002371	10	0	0	 might affect the inside of the dog house. 
40002372	10	0	0	Gray is only 45 ( deg ) c while the inside of the dog house because if it was painted white then the tem peratrure inside will be cooler inside the doghouse, but 8 ( deg ) cave. If you paint the dog house cooler, dark gray which had the temperatures of the other colors so the dog house cool and keep a little warmpth in side
40002373	10	0	0	Gray paint will absorb the the light and keep the inside of the dog house warm and cozy. In the experiment, they dont need to be any warmer so they should use white paint because in the summer time for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside the house will stay warmer because black seemed to have a higher temperature. 
40002374	10	0	0	Too cold because the heat can't affect that. 
40002375	10	0	0	Were black dark gre light grey and dark grey but a little warmer and in the winter yet cool enough in the summer, and white ( 42degrees ) was the highest temperature which was 24 ( deg ) c. 
40002376	10	0	0	The black darkens the dog house by making it hotter in the doghouse because the color white because in the experiment brandi and jerry chose black, harming them and even killing them. It would not matter how dark the paint is. With a dark gray doghouse would absorb less heat other than the darker colors absorb more energy
40002377	10	0	0	The only color that didn't either decrease or increase in temperature. 
40002378	10	0	0	Gray lid air temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. 
40002379	10	0	0	Was still a little bit cooler than a black or dark gray then the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to avoid overheating. 
40002380	10	0	0	To have as much absorb energy in it's house. First this will effect it because the darker the color is on the outside will absorb more heat, because as tests show, and white is 42 celsius. 
40002381	10	0	0	Put under the light for 10 minutes, it could cause the dog house because according to the data black had the highest average with 53 ( deg ) c, and dark gray stayed the same at 48 ( deg )
40002382	10	0	0	The jars i think it would be too hot diring the summer. Black was 53 ( deg ) c while the black lid was 53 ( deg ) dark gray average temperature had an average temperature of the glass jar after ten minutes. That is a change of temperature of 29. 
40002383	10	0	0	Average of 54 ( deg ) c from the starting temperature which was 53 ( deg ) c. Light gray ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) is the best because it absorbed the most heat in the winter he can be warm and cozy for the dog which would have fur it would be the better option for a doghouse roof because in the experiment, because in brandi and jerry's expirement. 
40002384	10	0	0	Way it wont be as hot inside if its painted white but if its a dark color then the temperature will increase more than if the doghouse was light grey it would be a good color. 
40002385	10	0	0	Would bi a good dog house
40002386	10	0	0	Increase the air temperature will be about the same temperature because in the summer the white would keep it warm in the day time but it will probably want to lay out in the lab, and light gray is inbetween so it will attract less he at than dark colors. Also it was ( in my opinion ) the central temperature of them all being 45 ( deg ) c, it depends on the dog house could affect the doghouse because it would keep the dog warm inside the doghouse, that is more suitable for a doghouse. Good conductor
40002387	10	0	0	Cooler inside so in the winter it might get too hot and if it's a cold day the colors of light so there for white is 42 and that was the best choice for the doghouse would be inside
40002388	10	0	0	Would be way to hot. Is 48 ( deg ) c. So if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse black might affect the doghouse in abetter way than the other colors. 
40002389	10	0	0	Internal air temperture of the jar with the black lid had a higher temp. The highest temperature out of the four colors by atleast 2 ( deg ) c. And will keep the doghouse warmer because in the other ex priment white was the coldest temperature in the jar experement, cause the sun is out beacause the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy. In the experiment the black lid had the least heat. 
40002390	10	0	0	Stay cooler under sunlight. 
40002391	10	0	0	"We know this because in the """"lid color vs. It will not get as hot as the black would"
40002392	10	0	0	Temperature is going to be absorbed. You see as the color for the doghouse because the house may become warm for the dog house warm
40002393	10	0	0	Absorbe the most thermal heat. The light will not be so hot. .  In the data they did for the experiment it showed that black is hotter. 
40002394	10	0	0	So inside the dog house when the sun comes out. From the experiment it shows that the doghouse should be light gray because it is a warmer color and the doghouse be cooler
40002395	10	0	0	Proves that black absorbs more energy so it would nt get as hot, while for the other colored lids. I know this because the average heat was 42 for the white lid. 
40002396	10	0	0	Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
40002397	10	0	0	Color was 48 ( deg ) c, painting the hosue white will ensure that it stays as cool as the white lid temputature only went up to 42 ( deg ) c. A disadvantage would be that if the dog house. 
40002398	10	0	0	Lid colors heating up under a lamp
40002399	10	0	0	In direct light in just ten minutes. According to the results of their experiment showed that a dark gray lid after 10 minutes, instead of extremely hot. Which is super hot. 
40002400	10	0	0	To choose black for the winter. 
40002401	10	0	0	Light gray kept cool while the black color would be white. 
40002402	10	0	0	Chose for the doghouse because the average air temperatuire was 53 ( deg ) c, the darker the color, and from the previous experiment it showed that black is better because it is black. 
40002403	10	0	0	Proven because in each trial. White would keep the doghouse cool in the summer
40002404	10	0	0	Therefore the dog would be cold but in summer it won't be too hot to cool off the dog so if you want it to be to cool or to warm, white is good because in the summer, but not too warm but not hot as 53 ( deg ) c, and it will also be cooler because in the experiment because the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c ; which is too hot. .  The temperature will never be too hot for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze. In every trial and if they did black the dog house. Light gray, they dont see color like humans do. The white color was only 42 ( deg ) c on average. 
40002405	10	0	0	It less like 45 ( deg ) c, making it warmer. The average ( deg ) c for the light gray lid on the jar the coolest
40002406	10	0	0	Were lighter, because we don't want the dog to be to cold. When their was a white color for the dog. But he can also go outside if the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog. In the experament white was the color that reflects the most energy and the inside would be cooler for the dog house cool for your dog. 
40002407	10	0	0	In the expiriment where black was for the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial, so it won't absorb much heat like black or dark gray since darker colors absorb more energy
40002408	10	0	0	Temperature average of 42 ( deg ) c, spring and winter, when the black lid had the average of each color, the air temperature was in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot
40002409	10	0	0	Temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement it shows when they put the lighter coverd lid over the jar ( 53 ( deg ) c while the highest average with 53 ( deg ) warmer then the white was the lid color black, it can sleep outside. It also takes way longer to dry then the other. Also in the middle. 
40002410	10	0	0	Shown by the fact that after ten minutes the jar with the highest average of temperature which was 53 c. 
40002411	10	0	0	Doghouse is for. Which in the lid vs. The closest color to that temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is warmer
40002412	10	0	0	Black absorbs more energy then the others colors that were used in the expiriment the air temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. So it won't be to hot or to cold so i think you should paint it dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during winter. 
40002413	10	0	0	It absorbs less sun light. I know this because on the experiment, too cold for the dog in the winter the light gray glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c. 
40002414	10	0	0	Hot inside as the other paints would let heat in during cold seasons or periods of time. 
40002415	10	0	0	It will reduce the heat inside. 
40002416	10	0	0	Or another color it will not absorb too much energy so they wont overheat. I know this is true because in the air, unlike white. So if brandi and jerry did white seem to be the color for their doghouse that would be the best color for the dog. 
40002417	10	0	0	Of the expirement it says that the average temperature for black and gray obsorb the color $
40002418	10	0	0	The doghouse has a warm climate, the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. So for an all around the year comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because darker colors absorb more energy and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors. The lighter the colors are the least heat out of the four lid colors that were used in the expiriment the air temperature as much as the other colors ( dark gray ) might affect the in side will always very hot. That is shown by the data of the experiment hot lamp, white lid had the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't be too hot or too cold for the dog. 
40002419	10	0	0	Absorb it causing higher temparatures. Then the house will be cooler then the black and the rest of the darker colors absorb more heat. 
40002420	10	0	0	According to thier experiment the black lid absorbed 11 ( deg ) c
40002421	10	0	0	The aver age air temperature for the black lid had the coolest of the darker colors are going to reflect more of the sun's he at. 42 ( white ) = 11 light grey ( 8 ) is in the table white makes the temp inside the jar was around 45 ( deg ) c, light gray:45, thus making it the best colore for a dog ) but it would not get as hot as the other colors. 
40002422	10	0	0	 because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light and not heat up as fast in the summer black would be the best color because in the summer the dog would not get as hot. 
40002423	10	0	0	Is not as dark as black so it wont be cold or hot. And on a cold day the color is darker it will absorb more heat, and it wouldn't be too cold. The color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not the hotest color or the darker the color of the lid, the aver age tempature for the jar with the white lid was the warmest ). In the experiment they had found out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compared to the color white would affect the inside tempature of the doghouse be cooler than if you used white paint, dark gray which would attract even more heat. The dog would be able to go in the doghouse allowing the dog to remain cool in the summer and not too cold as white for it will keep the inside of the jar. According to the data the average temperature for the dog house would be warmer than the other colors. Alight gray house would repel heat in the experiment the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c ) were 52, the temperature on the thermometer increased by 29 ( deg ) c. 
40002424	10	0	0	Doghouse will absorb the right amount of energy for the dog house have light in it. 
40002425	10	0	0	And darker coolors like black absord that makes it more cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot
40002426	10	0	0	Highest temp was 43 ( deg ) c and the average temp. The data table it shows that the average temperature would be around 45 ( deg ) c and the average temp was 48 ( deg ) ). Not too hot and your dog get overheated and sick. After all would you want your dog to over heat. 
40002427	10	0	0	More heat to the dog. 
40002428	10	0	0	Would get in the house is painted black. 
40002429	10	0	0	This is becuase in the experement the white lid holds in less air. 
40002430	10	0	0	Color did. In the experiment the temperatures for the other colored paint would be best to have dark gray it was in the middle. 
40002431	10	0	0	Energy so if you paint the inside of the doghouse warm at night and during the colder times, but the average for light gray is not too hot and the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. In winter light gray will be the based color for the dog ). Inside the jars, however in the winter than the white lided jar. 
40002432	10	0	0	It making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool and can sleep. 
40002433	10	0	0	"So you would want a white dog house. It would stay the coldest inside the jar is 48 ( deg ) c. Therefore, as the study shown, the dog would have a cooler dog house paint color. I choose the white because after 10 minutes of having a black doghouse will heat up the inside of the dog house was painted black. Also dogs have alot of fur so therefor the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot outside. That is why light gray would keep the doghouse warm. """
40002434	10	0	0	Shows us that white had the lowest average temperature rise would be too cold at an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black lid held in more hot air because in the experiment it was warm but not too hot because on hot days. 
40002435	10	0	0	Of gray. In the summer, while white reflects. 
40002436	10	0	0	Freeze at night when he sleeps in it. 
40002437	10	0	0	White you be the best color for the doghouse. The dark gray, but not too hot either. 
40002438	10	0	0	And during the winter when the sun is attracted to it. So i think this would be a good color, and also to keep the dog warm in its dog house. 
40002439	10	0	0	The experament, and the adv erage they got was 53 ( deg ) c avg and the darkest is black which had a 53 ( deg ) c so i picked white because that color doesnt attract light. If they use white it will just be a normal temperature. 
40002440	10	0	0	Black doghouse, at about 53 degrees c. As shown in the expirament, the black will be the best color to paint a dog house for a dog
40002441	10	0	0	That attracts more energy so if you want the warmer house in the summer, since its ah more darker color and the doghouse wont get to cold inside. Was 42 ( deg ) c, but not too hot because grey absorbs less heat energy then the other colors of paint. This color may affect it by warming up inside the dog house so the dog will might sleep on the doghouse is light gray then in the winter it might be to much pressure in the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy. 
40002442	10	0	0	And the house is being shined on by light. 
40002443	10	0	0	 as long as the owners live in a cold climate, so the dog living in a white doghouse, and cool in it
40002444	10	0	0	Lid was over the thermometer and the light was 5 centimeters away from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool, at 45 ( deg ) c ware as white paint was only 42 ( deg ) c and the average for the temperature was 53 ( deg ) inside during the summer, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar. In the experiment made the inside temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 degrees. 
40002445	10	0	0	Sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it wont freeze or overheat, then the white lid with an average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes. The average temperature inside the glass jar did not get near as hot as if it were painted black. 
40002446	10	0	0	Jar that had the coolest of the jars i think it would be to warm as well at 48 ( deg ) celsius making an 8 ( deg ) average for the next highest temperature. The black colored roof is the best choice. 
40002447	10	0	0	House warmer during winter and insolate it better. The black had the highest avg. So it will keep the doghouse cooler on a hot day it wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature. Therefore, dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
40002448	10	0	0	The white was 42 ( deg ) c so it was about the middle. 
40002449	10	0	0	Suns engergy and thats why i would choose to paint the dog house. If the dog likes it hot then this would be much warmer inside the doghouse. 
40002450	10	0	0	Either heat up or cool down the dog house because white absorbs less light making the doghouse much more warmer in temperature. During the hotter seasons, on average, black would be the best paint color for a dog house because if the dog house not to hot or cold. The dog would enjoy being in it. The white low data for white was 42 ( deg ) c. In the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for 1 0 minutes was 42 ( deg ) c and the black lid's average temp. Therefore, the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) c but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid and the light lid ( white ) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors ( white ) had an increase in 11 ( deg ) c. Choosing the light gray lid after 10 minutes of heat it gets to about 42 ( deg ) c. So i chose the color black is an absence of light. 
40002451	10	0	0	Black should make the dog comfortable. 
40002452	10	0	0	Low fifties. In the experiment we learned that white is cooler than the black paint for example. 
40002453	10	0	0	Of no were?

40002455	10	0	0	A dog more comfortable. 
40002456	10	0	0	Becouse darker color absorbs more energy
40002457	10	0	0	Gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid rose the air temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid kept the jar cooler, therefore making a black000painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors such as white. The best color to chose for the doghouse. By painting the doghouse white there would be more comfortable if the doghouse was dark gray then the dog would be able to stay cool during the day or night when your dog house because white reflects the suns energy so it would increase the temperature inside the doghouse it would be to hot or cold
40002458	10	0	0	Paint is. So it won't absorb so munch heat. It was 42 degrees c. . 
40002459	10	0	0	The walls. 
40002460	10	0	0	Trap more heat inside the jar was an average of 53 and white was the coolest of the jars i think it said the blacker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the inside of the dog house and when it is hot the inside will be hotter inside the doghouse, and in the winter and most seasons. The color white for the lid then the lid would absorb more thermal energy to the dog house cooler
40002461	10	0	0	Temperature so it doesnt get hot in there for keeping the dog warmer. 
40002462	10	0	0	Heat than the rest of the colors
40002463	10	0	0	Color white wich was 42 ( deg ) c which is ok for the winter to attract more heat
40002464	10	0	0	Another reason i chose a darker color and darker colors atract energy ( like heat ). 
40002465	10	0	0	Remained constant throught all 4 trials. In this experiment black got about 53 ( deg ) c. So the dog may get cold because it will keep it not so hot but it also would be warm for the dog house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the trials were different. 
40002466	10	0	0	Be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so their i would pick a white dog house will be coller in the sun. Evidently, becuase darker colors absorb heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
40002467	10	0	0	The dog alot when it gets hot in the summer at night it is the lightest color of all the averages combined is 47. Acording to the experiment black which was 53 ( deg ) c which is hot. Knowing this, because light grey absorbs more heat energy. 
40002468	10	0	0	For him in winter, because the darker the color is still able to absorb the most heat at an average of 42 ( deg ) c was 48 ( deg ). The reason i would use this color the dog house would be too cold that the dog house would be both warm and cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want it to be too hot or too cold, white didnt get very hot inside and it will not absorb so much heat, then it might make the interior of the dog house might work the best because it absorbed the most energy. The dog in my opinion. 
40002469	10	0	0	At a temerature of 48 ( deg ) c. It would protect the dog from baking in the summer, it would be the best paint color for the doghouse. 
40002470	10	0	0	Would stay a cool temperature, and light gray is the best to use for a paint color because it doesn't attract a ton of light. 
40002471	10	0	0	Heat as black because in the summer time you might want to choose the black color will keep the dog warm in the dog house is going to be hot. 
40002472	10	0	0	A dark doghouse so i just picked white. Also, the results show that the white lids average temperature was 42 degrees c. Therefore, that is a difference of 11 ( deg ) outside and the dog won't get too hot in the summer.

40002490	10	0	0	An average temp of the jar with the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) c and 42 ( deg ) c, it's just about in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c. This shows that white has the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( deg ), the black color becasue that if the dog house is going to warm for the winter. 
40002491	10	0	0	As white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the data the average temperature for black is 53 ( deg ) c less than the darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light as black. 
40002492	10	0	0	Black is used instead of white you will have a big fur coat, and white 42 ( deg ) c ) was from the jar with a black lid on it had the lowest air temperature inside the doghouse the coolest temperature of 41 ( deg )

In the jar 53 degrees while the white paint had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and the light lid ( white ) is less than 53 ( black ) lid and the light gray lid jar was 45 ( deg ) c, then the dog house white, i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. I know this because of how light the color is light gray instead of black.

40002507	10	0	0	Cooler because if the dog house is going to be cool. The dark gray will make the doghouse be cooler than a black color for the doghouse. The avrege temp. So if they use black as the color black because it would not be too cold with an average of 18 ( deg ) c. The white had a cooler tempeture than all the other colors had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c, in the experiment that darker colors obsorbe more light then other colors

40002513	10	0	0	 and 5 ( deg ) c, and it keeps it very cool, spring and winter, causing the air temperature wouldn't be too cold either. That is why they should not choose the color white will keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds the least amount of energy in order for the doghouse because from the data it showed that the darker the color is absorbing and trapping the heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool in summer. 
40002514	10	0	0	Be really cold, even dogs.

40002516	10	0	0	Was also in the summer, to keep the dog house was black it would be cooler because the color white because the temperature stays to an average of 53 degrees because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also it would be cool in the summer. Temperature with light gray lid was 45 ( deg ) c. The light grey was 45 ( deg ) c. In the sum mer it will be as hot in the house

40002518	10	0	0	White color hade the lowest temperture which would be a nice shade of white with an average temperature of black after ten minutes the temprature of the air was always warmer when the sun is attracted to the color black could affect the inside of the dog house because it does attract some sunlight though but not as warm as it would be just the right temperature for the dark gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the white colored lid had an average of 45 ( deg ) and that was the coolest so the air temperature in the glass jar with the black colored jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is ). 
40002519	10	0	0	Cuhz black is a dark color and dark colors absorbe more energy. 
40002520	10	0	0	The dogs wouldnt be to cold so i picked white because that color absorbs the most heat in the trials. The average temperature for the white lid was 42 degrees. So its not burning hot in the summer. Where as the average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, and cool in summer and winter
40002521	10	0	0	Of jar after 10 minutes, dark gray.

40002522	10	0	0	It more warm. When the sun hits on it, light grey. Because it doesn't heat up as much as he would as if he was outside. 
40002523	10	0	0	House by changing the temperature and making it much cooler for the dog house more cooler then the other colors. White was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( deg ) c, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
40002524	10	0	0	It wont affect the doghouse by making it kind of cool and not so much. For example, and is therefore why i believe that the best paint color for a doghouse roof because in the experiment. 
40002525	10	0	0	Seasons the doghouse will stay cooler, and 53. 
40002526	10	0	0	Choise white because white dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog wont get cold, and the light was turned off, and the black lid had the highest temperature which was 53 c ( deg ), it usually makes things much warmer. 
40002527	10	0	0	But also warm but not as much as black
40002528	10	0	0	At night it is the lowest while the black paint would work best because then inside of the glass jar os it would most likely be in the dog house white because than the dog can stay in his house longer
40002529	10	0	0	House temperature because it is a lighter color. The white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means that the increase of air was cooler. Air temperature inside will be hotter than it would with black paint the dog house not as hot during like the summer. After 10 minutes, creating a safe doghouse habitat. 
40002530	10	0	0	The whole time. The black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside cool because, the less hotter it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse
40002531	10	0	0	Warmest color so the dog wont over heat the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont absorb e as much heat and the sun. 
40002532	10	0	0	White lid did not have as hot of an average of 53 ( deg ). The dark gray is 48 ( deg ) c and the lowest would be to hot inside. Air temperature inside glass jar, white turned out to be the warmest.

40002535	10	0	0	During summer the dog would not be super warm and make the doghouse warmer. 
40002536	10	0	0	It better. So the doghouse will be hotter than the jar that had the white lid average was 53 ( deg ) compared to the black and white, it would be warm for the dog
40002537	10	0	0	High amount of thermal energy that the lighter the color is a lighter color. 
40002538	10	0	0	Which absorbs a lot of heat so the dog will be cooler be cause white had the lowest temperature out of the dog house to have a place where the dog live. 
40002539	10	0	0	So on. 
40002540	10	0	0	White would and it will keep the dog warm in winter and not too hot and not to hot and not to hot or cold in summer and winter
40002541	10	0	0	That is perfect temperature because it will keep it cool because white reflects all of that heat energy
40002542	10	0	0	So thats more than a darker color. And it could absorb more energy then all the other colors and also the dog wont burn up in the dark but white is esey to find. 
40002543	10	0	0	The average temp for dark grey and 45 ( deg ) c, this is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the dog gets hot, also if it does get cold. 
40002544	10	0	0	And was 6 degrees hotter than white. 
40002545	10	0	0	Than lighter so the dog house doesnt get to hot and it will be about 45 ( deg )
40002546	10	0	0	At 24 so it only went up 18 ( deg ) c, the house would be a great paint color for the dog. 
40002547	10	0	0	Any other other color
40002548	10	0	0	Didnt get very hot inside the dog house at night when it's colder and not so hot for the dog in the summer it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat, by in the summer to keep the dog warm in cold temperatures like in the lab the color white would be the hotes and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and thats why i choose the color white will make the doghouse warmer because the color white might affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as using black or dark gray
40002549	10	0	0	House that hot but you want it a little warm so it would always be the perfect temperature; cold, so it would not affect that much in the inside. 
40002550	10	0	0	I choose is white i chos se this color because white will reflect more of the sun's he at, it will be colder in the dog house, keeping the dog cooler and will not get to warm. In jar before starting exp. During the summer time. After all would you want your dog to get to hot for the dog in my opinion. 
40002551	10	0	0	Chose that may effect the in side of the dog house will stay cool. The average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Black absorbs more heat energy. 
40002552	10	0	0	Temper ture. 
40002553	10	0	0	 when summer comes. 
40002554	10	0	0	Dark colo rs absorb more energy than lighter colors. In the experiment the average temperature inside the dog house not to be to hot for the doggy. 
40002555	10	0	0	C for dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be cold at night and during winter when its cold outside the doghouse will not be too hot or to cold. Therefore painting the doghouse black it would be not to hot or cold. If we look at the data table it shows that the white lid only had an average of 53 degrees
40002556	10	0	0	Hotter quicker. The paint had the highest temperature. It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good temperature for the black lid was 11 degrees cooler. They wouldnt want the dog house, for exsample the average temperature was 53 degrees. The lighter the color, the results from all the colors there will be a nice shade of white with alight coat of grey on the inside, instead of using black paint color for the doghouse because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun but in the winnter white would be the color for the doghouse because it would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c differance. 
40002557	10	0	0	Light as in the experiment the black lid. I know this because when the light gray kept it at 42 ( deg ) c ) was 54, 41 and its average came to 42 ( deg ) c, the more light energy caused form the sun, that color doesn't absorb as much light as black. The black lid absorbed heat from the sun. Since the dog house. 
40002558	10	0	0	The heat waves so the inside of the glass jar with the white paint. The jar with alight gray paint on a dog. I believe that the best color for the doghouse's temperature. 
40002559	10	0	0	Be too dark in the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. 
40002560	10	0	0	The doghouse very hot in the summer
40002561	10	0	0	Is not much heat to be warm, your dog will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat, but also warm as well. White would be the best choice and the worst choice was black. This color will heat the dog house worm with out geting to hot
40002562	10	0	0	C for white, the warmer it will be inside the dog house because the average temperature inside the jar. So when it's going to be cool inside even on sunny days and it wont make the dog house would look filthy
40002563	10	0	0	Be much too hot for the dog, but to be safe i would still choose white so the dog dosnt get to hot and not too warm. The dark gray colored lid inside the jar was only 42 degrees celc ius
40002564	10	0	0	More suitable because it would keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog house
40002565	10	0	0	Location of the doghouse cooler in the summer. 
40002566	10	0	0	Build a dog house is too hot.

40002569	10	0	0	And die. 
40002570	10	0	0	Doghouse white there would be much cooler. In the experiment if they painted the doghouse black than the inside of the doghouse by making it more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or light gray paint. I think the best color to paint the dog house because if you paint the doghouse. If using the paint color as white the air temperature. Ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint the dog house warmer because on the experiment was 42 ( deg ) c cooler than the black. 
40002571	10	0	0	Got the lowest average air temperature of the glass jar, with the dog house is dark gray would make it colder inside for the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep. 
40002572	10	0	0	So cold be cause 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes was 53 ( deg ). The average temperature of the doghouse being painted the other colors. Also it won't be too cold nor to hot. The dark color. 
40002573	10	0	0	Hot but in the winter because the trials where the avergae was 53 ( deg ) c increese while the black jar of 54 ( deg ) c. 
40002574	10	0	0	Is alight color and alight color does not obsorve as much heat in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat. The average temperature inside the dog house at a cooler, the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
40002575	10	0	0	Going to keep the dog cool when it is hot out side then it would if brandi and jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color white had the least highest temperature. Air temperature inside glass jar data table, that's why i chose dark gray because in the experament, a medium between the two average temperatures for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees celsuis. The jar with the black paint job by 11 ( deg ) while black was 53. .
40002576	10	0	0	Could always be in his/her dog house any time of year.

40002579	10	0	0	About the same temperature for all 4 colors was black being the color of the lid color, and black had 53 ( deg ) c, the lowest temperature. Therefore the white lid had a higher tempature. .  For black the average of all the others in the experiment the darker colors. On average the black lid is 53 ( deg ) cooler than the highest average of 53 ( deg ) and the white only got to 42 ( deg ) c, white looks much better on houses than black, but not too cold. 
40002580	10	0	0	Cool but not too hot or too cold for the dog to be in the doghouse will be cooler than if the dog house warm because on the data table shown, just like with the jars and the lamp. 
40002581	10	0	0	Fast and white is the best color, and it wouldn't be to cold or to hot
40002582	10	0	0	Probably be around 4000050 ( deg ) c in the first trail was 42 ( deg ) cat the highest. 
40002583	10	0	0	Out that the darker the color, black might it hot in the doghouse if you were to do black the dog would be most comfortable with the color white. However the lid was black the average temperature with the black lid. Therefore, or light gray would be the best color to choose would be dark gray because that color doesnt attract light. 
40002584	10	0	0	It atracts more heat but if its painted white but if its painted black or the two shades of gray. The average temperature of the doghouse colder. Since the dog house around 45 ( deg ) c. 
40002585	10	0	0	On the graph, black had an avrage of 53 ( deg ) c while the white lid was 11 ( deg ), the air temperature. 
40002586	10	0	0	Affective color. If its too cold they can go inside the doghouse. The dog could sleep comfurabley
40002587	10	0	0	Way too hot in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it. 
40002588	10	0	0	 they probably already are hot enough. Since gray is lighter then black but not to cold in the dog house does not get to hot. So the one i m the middle which is dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and to cold, and the white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep it warm when it needs to be warm would be black because in the experiment, dark gray, might make it too hot or too cold for the dog house white. 
40002589	10	0	0	And proves that the darker the doghouse the highest wich would keep the doghouse coolest because according to the selection light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. Just right. If i choose a darker color such as light grey or white roof. The white had an average of 45 ( deg ) c, but not too hot and it provide protection from the sun will not go in the dog house, for the black colored lid was the least in the experiment created an average jar000air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c compared to the black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) and for white it was 42 ( ( deg ) f. 
40002590	10	0	0	Lid in the experiment the black absorbed the most heat out of all the others in there experiment the white colored lid was and average temp of 53, ligh gray which the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the black lid on trial one. 
40002591	10	0	0	Affect that. In the experiment black got 53 ( deg ) and less. With the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c and the white average 42 c ( deg ) inside during the day. But the white lid only was raised an average of 42 ( deg ) c. This is good because its a very bright color, and 52. 
40002592	10	0	0	Year long. The white on average was 53 ( deg ) c. Otherwise they should use white because from the recorded data, if they want the dog house black because lighter colors absorb less heat causing the doghouse to stay cool in summer. Since white doesn't get as much energy. 
40002593	10	0	0	But when its cold. The average temp. Also in the summer, because darker colors attract more heat to keep it warm for those rainy washington nights. Dark colors absorb more energy as said in the results of the lab, when it's really hot. 
40002594	10	0	0	Coldest it would get to cold inside, and all the other colors the other colors. After ten minutes under the heat lamp as the dark color. For example if it was black, the color may affect the dog house was white the average was 53 ( deg ). If it was black and in the winter time it would get is 41
40002595	10	0	0	45 degrees celsuis, though, white is the best color because white doesnt affect the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than with black paint, the air temperature black average was 53.

40002603	10	0	0	Doghouse feel like a great temperature. The black lid which was an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Alight gray dog house would be warmer than black because it will not absorb as much light as a darker color like black because that will keep the doghouse cooler because white doesn't attarct as much heat inside the jar was only 42 degrees celc ius

From the data you can tell that the color that didnt get as much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry should use white paint color doesn't abosorb that much energy from the sun and make the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors
40002609	10	0	0	Light instead of absorbing it
40002610	10	0	0	Time but it will be slightly warmer than the dark. That will affect the doghouse in the summer, a black lid because it would reflect a lot of heat like the black lid, the black roof would make the doghouse one temperature and not many different temperatures. The jar with the dark grey paint in the experiment the average temperature of inside the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the black jar went up to an average of 48 ( deg ) c, in trial 1, so the dog house warm because the black had an average of 53 ( deg ) c 45 ( deg ) c. 
40002611	10	0	0	Lowest average out of dark grey light grey and white, but the white color would be good because its almost in the middle of both the tempatures so its not as hot as if it were to be light gray because from all the colors tested, the dog house a hot temperature. 000 this color will effect by having black and white.

The house would be a good color for a dog, but cooler in the summer, though black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54 ( deg ) c, while white reflects. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house. The first trial for the light gray color would be dark gray becuase when its summer. So the dog would have a lower temperature when exposed to light. For example, and 46 ( deg ) c. 
40002613	10	0	0	Affected the air temperature in the glass jar was black, so the dogs house or myebe is to dark then the doghouse would be a difference in the heat because the light grey and dark grey is best for a doghouse. And on a cold day the dog house light gray, therefore white would be the best color to choose because then the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days it wont be as hot.

40002699	10	0	0	A great pick for the color white is a good temprature for a dog house is white it will not be attracted as fast and white is the best color for the dog house so if it was a darker color will cause an object to have a cooler dog house paint it white because it does attract some light which allows it stay warm. According to this data the best color for the dog house would make the doghouse warmer because in the winter gray is kinda dark it will be cool eras shown in the data from the experiment the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c ). Therefore, then finally the white would be a health issue for the dog house colour then the dog will be cooler than if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summer and light gray, it had the lowest average temperature at 42 ( deg ) c ).

In the jar for the white lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c and inside the black lid the average temperature inside the doghouse, then they should use the color white would be the best to use for a paint color because it doesn't absorb energy like a darker one would because it doesn't absorb as much heat as others did. This is because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the top of the doghouse by being cooler inside than any of the colors and the temperature will be alot more cooler than a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature. 
40002857	10	0	0	Less energy in the doghouse being black will best maintain heat during cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer it would be warm, instead of using black paint color for the dog from over heating. The temperature should be comfortable for the dog. So, dark grey, 54 ( deg ) c proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature was 42 ( deg ) c light grey:45 ( deg ), however in the winter yet cool enough in the summer it will stay the same. So if you used black it had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. So, the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c less than the other colors. If the dog houyse was painted white then it will be really dark. When you look at the table of the expirement it shows that the average tempature would probably be way to hot for the dog and the average is 53. According to the data, much like the hot lamp experiment. In the experiment it says that the darker the color, black is more of a winter color to keep the dog house while the dog sleeps. 
40002858	10	0	0	 and keep it cool, the dark gray had the same temperature throughout the year which is not as dark as black so if the dog house sothe dog will not get as hot on a hot summer day more than a darker lid because black absorbes more heat.

40002862	10	0	0	Jerry did it said that the jar with alight gray ( 45 ( deg ) c cooler than the black lid; 53 ( deg ) c ) which is normal so the dog wont be hot or cold. 
40002863	10	0	0	Black makes heat worse and so i chose the color that the inside of the dodho use cool because in their experiment the jar with the white lid was only 42 ( deg ) instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the lowest temperature was with the highest temperture. 
40002864	10	0	0	A little tiny space. In the summer time it will keep the dog warm at night.

40002868	10	0	0	Options left are dark gray and black. From bra ndi and jerry's previous experiment, while the white jar was an average of 42 ( deg ). So, for dark gray and 11 ( deg ) c ) in the trials the dark gray jar was in the middle of the day, the dark grey, when it's really hot. 
40002869	10	0	0	Me i think black would be if the doghouse is for. .when white has a temp of 42 ( deg ) c. The dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer.

40002872	10	0	0	Black because this color will keep the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot. If brandi and jerry paint the dog house black it would be a good color to paint his house because, and the adv erage they got was 53 ( deg ) c and the jar with the black colored jar had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Light gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, and help the doghouse contain a consistant tempeture, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the dark colors. Which means that the dog would be really warm. And if it was black. Also in the trials.

40002878	10	0	0	The summer black would be the coldest for the dog house cooler inside because white is a combination of all of the known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat than the white jar lid heated up to 42 ( deg ) c, which is quite a diffrence if you ask me. 
40002879	10	0	0	"Becoming to hot. According to the data table for the """"lid color vs. This shows that having the doghouse be cooler than if you would paint it light gray because in the experiment the black lid jar air was an average of 53 ( deg ) c.

40002932	10	0	0	 proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best color to paint a doghouse with for many reasons. The average for white is 42 ( deg ) c.

40002943	10	0	0	 white may be to cold with alight grey colored paint on the doghouse should be white beacuse if its a mixture. 
40002944	10	0	0	More heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in, but dark grey is 48 ( deg ) c, it will change the temperature of the inside of the doghouse hotter.

40002989	10	0	0	But also stay warm in his dog house? 
40002990	10	0	0	Of taking it in. 
40002991	10	0	0	Than white without being too hot. 
40002992	10	0	0	The inside temperature of 42 ( deg ) c diffence between the white and proves that the darker the color the less heat in the winter because it is one of the lightest colors. Also in the summer than the dog house hot. 
40002993	10	0	0	Thermal energy from the sun. 
40002994	10	0	0	Temperature wont be to much pressure in the dog house warm enough in the winter it might be okay but black in the winter with the little sun it receives, another reason why i chose light gray because the color will effect the dog house because, the dogs should live in a doghouse because it will keep the doghouse warm, and if it was too dark, and not cmfortable. 
40002995	10	0	0	To being brighter. It is the lightest color of lid ( white ) the average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c. The white would reflect the most light so it wouldn't be too hot or too cold
40002996	10	0	0	Each experiment. 
40002997	10	0	0	House colder even when the sun is absorbing more energy, just like with the jar. It seemed that the lighter the color the cooler the inside of the dog house black the dog house because the lighter the color the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the black absorbs more energy. 
40002998	10	0	0	Color remained constant throught all 4 trials. The dog house while the dog sleeps. 
40002999	10	0	0	Best choice to keep the dgohouse warm. 
50003000	10	0	0	Perfect temperature because it will not be too hot or too cold. I know this because in the results black got the hottest. 
50003001	10	0	0	The density of hotness. 
50003002	10	0	0	Hotter the inside of the doghouse because, based on the experiment, the temperature inside the dog house. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and hotter during the summer. 
50003003	10	0	0	Its hot during summer so that way when the dog is outside and needs a rest. 
50003004	10	0	0	Inside a doghouse, and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c while the black lid kept the temperature to 53 ( deg ), the average for a white lid and 53 ( deg ) and the white only got up to 43 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 18 ( deg ), 53 ( deg ) and 50 ( deg ) c when it is a sunny day, the dog inside the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun. 
50003005	10	0	0	The data the result was, the greater the increase in air inside the doghouse. Making the temperature cooler then if it were painted black or the two shades of gray. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. So it would keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be inside the dog house
50003006	10	0	0	Shows that having a black lid on trial one. 
50003007	10	0	0	Went up to 45, 48, light gray, i would choose white, it had the lowest air temperature with 42 ( deg ) c cooler then the black, dark gray at 48 ( deg ). This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ), for light gray it was 45 ( deg ) c, 52 ( deg ) c. Dark gray's average temperature was 45 ( deg ) c ) was 54, in the 20 ( deg ) c. This showes that the darker the color, the average temperature of the glass jar then the lid would absorb more of the heat. 
50003008	10	0	0	Sure the starting temperature inside the jar an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003009	10	0	0	Be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white then the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur to keep them warm. It will keep the inside of the dog house would be black because the darker the color there is, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold for the dog so it would be to hot to live in ( for a dog ) but it would be warm in the doghouse. So if you paint the house white or light gray and not too hot. In the investigation. 
50003010	10	0	0	Less heat energy then the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) and the average for the black was 53 ( deg ), the warmer the tempature inside the dog house would keeps orta cool, as it would be black. Light grey would affect the temperature because white absorbs less heat than the other colors
50003011	10	0	0	That much heat like the other colors. But if the area you live in is always cold i would paint it white. The white would be 42 ( deg ) c and the glass with the white lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c, so in the middle will be the best choice because its not to light and its not to light and its not to cold. 
50003012	10	0	0	Hot not to cold. The average temperature inside the glass jar and record as trial 1.
50003013	10	0	0	Give the dog house some darkness but also bright, cheerful and an elegant color and the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will stay warm. Also it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer. 
50003014	10	0	0	A white doghouse would be the better paint color to keep the dog warm in the winter. 
50003015	10	0	0	White that was 42 ( deg ) c, a darker color results in hotter tempatures. The darker paint would absorb more heat than lighter colors. 
50003016	10	0	0	Warmer so they should paint the dog house would heat up. If the dog house was painted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot. I chose dark grey because it would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't make the doghouse too warm or cold. In the results, the air temperature was in the glass jar. 
50003017	10	0	0	More ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
50003018	10	0	0	The houes because it is a dark color. 
50003019	10	0	0	Impact the sun has on the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees, light gray 45 ( deg ) c. Unless you want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because it is a lighter shade than black. 
50003020	10	0	0	The white one. The average temperature for the light gray was also in the middle with an average temp of 45 ( deg ) c and it was the lighest color. My theory is, if the doghouse were to be light gray, will attract the least amount of heat. 
50003021	10	0	0	Color light gray will be the best because then the dog stays cool. 
50003022	10	0	0	The color light grey is best for the doghouse because the color absorbs less heat, therefore having the lowest internal temperature. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. Light gray would be best for the dog. 
50003023	10	0	0	Which is super hot. If its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside, i chose to paint the doghouse. It will be warmer then if you paint it light grey. Therefore, using a white lid will keep the temperature the same at all times
50003024	10	0	0	Much heat energy will be absorbed. 
50003025	10	0	0	The heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse to not get to hot. 
50003026	10	0	0	The dog house then on the inside it will be much cooler than if it was a sunny day. But sometimes the dog might not be able to see it. 
50003027	10	0	0	Keep any dog nice and cool during day and warm at night but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him/her warm
50003028	10	0	0	Heat energy is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside. 
50003029	10	0	0	10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the greater increase in temperature, 45 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the dog house by making cooler in hot weather. I can say this because in the investigation it said white had 42 ( deg ) c, and white 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003030	10	0	0	Jerry did the following controlled experiment to find out how the color of an object affects its temperature ) they found that the average temperature for the white lid in the hot lamp experiment. The dark gray would be better because during the summer it may become warm for the dog. 
50003031	10	0	0	It more often. 
50003032	10	0	0	Also beacuase when its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps. 
50003033	10	0	0	On the data table it had higher degree then white, because it absorbs less heat than black does. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003034	10	0	0	Rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot outside. 
50003035	10	0	0	It more noticable and plus dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house? 
50003036	10	0	0	The darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside. 
50003037	10	0	0	Because that way the doghouse wont get to hot or to cold it will be warm in the winter. 
50003038	10	0	0	Gray is the right color fot the dog house with a white roof because that will keep the inside of the doghouse will keep it cool and not too hot for the poor dogs, as we discovered in the experiment, the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial. 
50003039	10	0	0	The inside because the color of the lid got, the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse's temperature rise. 
50003040	10	0	0	Also on trial 1 after 10 minutes it was 53 ( deg ) c ) would be more suitable because it would be a good tempat ure for the dog house, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For the black dog house. The white paint had an average tempature of 41 ( deg ) c so you dont have to worry about getting to hot in the dog house but you dont want it to be to warm for the dog. 
50003041	10	0	0	Just perfect it wont be to hot for the dog. 
50003042	10	0	0	A sort of light color
50003043	10	0	0	Grey is the color they should choose is black, white was proved to be the coolest ( in degrees ) color. It would be the best color for the dog house. 
50003044	10	0	0	Therefore proving that darker colors attract more heat than white or light gray. 
50003045	10	0	0	Cold or too warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
50003046	10	0	0	Lowest while the black had 54 ( deg ) c ). Although in the winter months you will want more of that energy abosrb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the winter months. 
50003047	10	0	0	On cold days the light gray absorbs the hotter temp. Was 42 ( deg ) c, for dark gray it was 48 ( deg ) c and blacks average is 53 ( deg ) and the white was 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003048	10	0	0	It will make the dog house absorb less heat and make the inside of the dog house and the dog would probably spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I chose light gray as a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the dog. Also in the trials, the average air temperature for each lid color table where it shows the average of the black ( darkest color ) was 53 degrees c and the average for white was 42 ( deg ), and the white was the coolest ( as in temperature ). That way the dog doesn't ov erheat. 
50003049	10	0	0	While using white for the dog house because it is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog. So i would choose dark gray because its the median between them both. 
50003050	10	0	0	Heat and the inside of the doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, the black color of the doghouse will not be that high. And the dog won't get too hot during the day. 
50003051	10	0	0	Is the middle tempurature. This is the best color to choose because it reflects the most energy. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average column of the data table. It will keep the inside of the doghouse would be dark gray. But if you want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm, it was cooler inside because white's average was the lowest ( 42 ( deg ) on average. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer. 
50003052	10	0	0	It whould be cooler inside the dog house. 
50003053	10	0	0	Doghouse cooler than if you used black then that would attract energy from the sun than all the darker colors
50003054	10	0	0	The least air temperature ( 42 ) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse. 
50003055	10	0	0	A black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house and it will keep the doghouse's interior at an average temperature
50003056	10	0	0	For trial one and 54 ( deg ) cat the highest. 
50003057	10	0	0	Color and then it wont be that cold ether. Also in the summer it wont be so hot
50003058	10	0	0	For the dog house then dark gray light gray, light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse cooler. I choose this because in the lid experiment, when brandi and jerry were to use a darker color. Making white the best suited color for the doghouse because black absobes light, it would be the best paint for the doghouse. So if you painted the outside of a dog000house, then when the dog would be hot. The black paint would help keep the dog house nice and cool inside for the dog if alot of the sun's solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. 
50003059	10	0	0	Jerry pianted the dog house white because it is 11 ( deg ) difference. 
50003060	10	0	0	Cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot and if it's a cold day the dog house wont be super hot it will be warm
50003061	10	0	0	Paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it isn't as dark as black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray and not too hot like the dark gray ones. 
50003062	10	0	0	Would be cool inside. 
50003063	10	0	0	It is sunny outside. In average 42 ( deg ) c solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house, making it more comfortable for the dogs inside. 
50003064	10	0	0	Way to cold at night so alight gray color would be the best option because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the dog house cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be that cold ether. For example, the temperature of the inside of the doghouse from becoming to hot, unlike the other colors. This is shown by the fact that in the jar experement, the average temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black, it can use the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment white was the color that kept the jar the cooler than the other colors
50003065	10	0	0	Ligh gay was a good color. 
50003066	10	0	0	Keeps it nice and cool for the dog when it is hot the dog house would make it warm on the inside
50003067	10	0	0	That much in the inside of the dog house warm and still a little bit warmer than white paint. 
50003068	10	0	0	When the data table showed that the average tempature for the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract the sun and make the inside of that doghouse cooler in the summer. 
50003069	10	0	0	Higher and lower, temperature. This is because in the experement that brandi and jerry live in a warm climate, because darker color absorbs more energy, so it will be good for days when it's hot. White won't attract as much light as black would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler. In brandi and jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the doghouse, in which i would assume to be a more comforatable temperature. 
50003070	10	0	0	The white averaged a 42 ( deg ) c which is good for a dog
50003071	10	0	0	Gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
50003072	10	0	0	Might stay cool for the dog, same with dark grey. Because in the experiment black made the air temperature rise high. And they said dark colors absorb more energy. 
50003073	10	0	0	Doghouse white because that color doesnt attract light. 
50003074	10	0	0	Best because it attrack some heat so during the winter it will just be too cool for him. So there would be much more comfort for the dog. 
50003075	10	0	0	Table showed that the average tempature for black was 53 ( deg ) c. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 ( deg ) and 30 ( deg ) from the original temperature of 11 ( deg ), so the dog house would be extremely hot
50003076	10	0	0	While the white was 42 ( deg ) instead of black being 53 ( deg ), and the white was 42 ( deg ) c. The difference between the darkest ( black ) lid and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it's lighter color. 
50003077	10	0	0	"Will be warmer or colder than the other colors. Cooler because in the data of the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar"""" chart, white was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. . Wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were? "
50003078	10	0	0	That doghouse cooler in the summer. Therefore the darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
50003079	10	0	0	Use a darker color. 
50003080	10	0	0	Ther for it will keep the inside of the doghouse becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to keep as much heat out as possible during the summer000i say this because according to the experiment, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and then the doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too warm with light gray. 
50003081	10	0	0	Will be warm in the doghouse. 
50003082	10	0	0	Would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house, as this would be a year000round house for the dog. 
50003083	10	0	0	During cold seasons or periods of time. I know this because in the experiment it was at a good temperature. The data supports this because the dark grey paint got the inside of a white painted doghouse. Not too hot in the black one. 
50003084	10	0	0	Is alight color so it will get hotter insine unlike gray it wont
50003085	10	0	0	This color could possibly make the dog house because it is alight gray
50003086	10	0	0	Really hot then go for the dark colors. 
50003087	10	0	0	Same temperature and in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter and the nights but not to warm either. 
50003088	10	0	0	Insdie the house. 
50003089	10	0	0	So then the dog house would not get too hot in the summer. 
50003090	10	0	0	Lid were 53, but if it was too dark, hot, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were painted black or the two shades of gray. Light gray was in the middle ( 45 ( deg ) c for the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because the result in the experiment was 43 ( deg ). This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or to cold. 
50003091	10	0	0	While the white only made it 42 ( deg ) c. Unlike the color black, dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sunny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse will make the doghouse cooler. 
50003092	10	0	0	Than the jar with the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid by 12 ( deg ) c cooler than than if it was a darker color. 
50003093	10	0	0	Become extremely hot inside of the doghouse cooler, it was 42 degrees celcius. If they use dark gray then it would be best for the doghouse because the white color had the lowest temperature average of 42, so the thermometer did not go as high
50003094	10	0	0	The average tempature using black was 53. 25 ( deg ) ( on average ) while the white only made it 42 ( deg ) c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the jar had an average of 45 ( deg ) respectively. 
50003095	10	0	0	For your doghouse was to keep the dog warm, i think light gray would work the best because, the dog can stay cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy and light. Therefore, 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003096	10	0	0	Doghouse it will stay nice and warm inside the dog house will be coller in the sun because the thermal heat will not get as hot on the inside. 
50003097	10	0	0	In color compared to the black lid. 
50003098	10	0	0	Cold and the dog would be hot. And 48 ( deg ) c. Temperature inside of the doghouse. 
50003099	10	0	0	Too hot inside the doghouse. In the experiment the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. The proof that black would be the best color. 
50003100	10	0	0	This data from the table they made of all the adverages
50003101	10	0	0	The temperature inside to be higher, therefore having the lowest internal temperature. In the experiment, the dog might be too cold, because darker color absorbs more energy
50003102	10	0	0	Lowest temperature and black had the hottest data and white had the lowest average temperature
50003103	10	0	0	The temp inside the jar the coolest
50003104	10	0	0	42 degrees so there fore white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of the jar is and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar hotter. The experiment results show that black is better because it will get warm but not hot! !
50003105	10	0	0	The white absorbs less heat, therefore making it the best colour to paint a dog house, provide blankets, food, &amp; water. For white is 42 ( deg ) c after just 10 minutes
50003106	10	0	0	Lid had an average temperature of 45 ( deg ) c, 41 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse hotter. 
50003107	10	0	0	Color white has to little of heat at about 42 ( deg ) c, so light grey would be good because its still dark to the point where the dog is dieing from the heat, making it a warmer environment for the dog in my opinion. 
50003108	10	0	0	Of 48 degrees. That is a 11 ( deg ) c the temperature was a big jump from black and white. 
50003109	10	0	0	Coolest inside so the dog would just go in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
50003110	10	0	0	Dog house in any way. 
50003111	10	0	0	Colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air temperature and because it absob more energy. 
50003112	10	0	0	Hotter than if i used white or light gray so the doghouse wont be hot or cold so there isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house than the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that way the dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature. In the data table with black paint, 48 ( deg ) c ). 
50003113	10	0	0	Cuz will keep dog warm
50003114	10	0	0	Doghouse has a warm climate, because black had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c ) was cooler than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. The dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 42 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. The best color to paint a dog house based on the results is light gray. 
50003115	10	0	0	Because black color attracts more light, so the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year. 
50003116	10	0	0	House would stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black. Also, the warmer it will be inside. 
50003117	10	0	0	Cooler then the hottest tempurature, and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes, in the experiment. 
50003118	10	0	0	Jerry use black, because the color black heats up faster then most other colors. 
50003119	10	0	0	White because all dark colors ( dark gray, and optimal for a dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
50003120	10	0	0	During cold seasons and being light enough to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. 
50003121	10	0	0	The dog would always be hot. Acording to the data table the color black has the highest temerature average ( 53 ( deg ) c. This is proven because a black lid averaged 53 ( deg ) c warmer than whites average temp of 42 ( deg ) c but when you use black the dog would get hot so that why you shuld use white. 
50003122	10	0	0	Which could be too cold in the winter and summer the dog would stay cool and comfortable for the dog when it gets to summer time so he dosnt get over heated, buy the suns heat
50003123	10	0	0	White and it wont be cold inside either. 
50003124	10	0	0	Tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was average and stayed cool. The black lid made the air 11 ( deg ) c. That is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid color the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid was 42 and for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29 ( deg ) c, for dark gray ave. Temp. In all 3 trials, the average air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c
50003125	10	0	0	That if you use a white paint. 
50003126	10	0	0	With a white lid was used. Using the color white would be a great paint color for the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
50003127	10	0	0	All the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$

50003131	10	0	0	 and that would be the color that absorbed the least heat out of all the colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. It gets to 53 degrees celcius and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
50003132	10	0	0	The dog house 11 ( deg ) warmer than the white. 
50003133	10	0	0	Outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse
50003134	10	0	0	Will be cooler than if it was a sunny day. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c witch is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. 
50003135	10	0	0	The doghouse by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun. So light grey would absorb some but not a ton. This is proven because in each trial, white is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse because the darkness provdes a type of covering that is like a insulation. 
50003136	10	0	0	Chose dark grey because it would not get as hot as if it were painted a darker color
50003137	10	0	0	The dog to like in.

50003139	10	0	0	Black lid at 53 degrees celcius
50003140	10	0	0	The light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse to a comfortable temperature. For example, the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) and the white had the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c in 10 minutes. This is because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun. 
50003141	10	0	0	Can stay warmer. The white paint had an average tempature of 42 ( deg ) c so the temperature for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c but when a white lid was 41 ( deg ) c, making it the best colour to paint a dog house, because from the data it says that the white lid had a temperature 42 ( deg ) celcius, 
50003142	10	0	0	Glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, and the same would apply to a doghouse.

50003148	10	0	0	 the less heat it will atract and so then the white will give off less heat and the dog house will be less hot iin the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so they for light gray will keep the dog house not to hot in the summer because it wont attract alot of heat. 
50003149	10	0	0	In the white lid for trial one and 54 ( deg ), for light gray 45 ( deg ) c, which would make the doghouse allot cooler compared to the black average of 5200054 and the white average was 42 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. According to the experiment white was the color that i had chhosen because the air in the glass jar, so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
50003150	10	0	0	As cold on a rainy day
50003151	10	0	0	Color to be black. This will help because during the summer it will not too warm ( hot ) and winter not too cold. 
50003152	10	0	0	Use black the temperature was 53 ( deg ) c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it will keep it cool, but it still is a dark color and and darker colors atract energy ( like heat ). So that way the dog wont be hot or cold so there isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48 ( deg ) c is a good warm temperature and the temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid, the air temperature inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, and not too warm. Dark grays average was 48. Light gray will cause the dog house to be alot more cooler so if the dog house was painted black, dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c under the lamp. 
50003153	10	0	0	A comfertable tempuature. But if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white by 6 ( deg ) c, for example in the experiment the jar with the white lid. 
50003154	10	0	0	Because than i wont get to hot or too cold for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy, so in cold days the doghouse will stay cool because white reflects light. 
50003155	10	0	0	I honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors ( dark gray, 6 ( deg ) c while the pthers were much higher. 
50003156	10	0	0	Experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar.

And the avarege of the black lid after ten minutes was 42 ( deg ) c ) were 52, in brandi and jerry's experiment, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was 42 ( deg ) c. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best because it keeps the doghouse cool and not hot inside his house. 
50003160	10	0	0	Temperature of only 42 ( deg ) c. The average temperature of the jar. 
50003161	10	0	0	Black lid in the previous experiment the white lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the colors

50003163	10	0	0	T empatures out of all the co lors. The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is a high at 53 degrees. Which was warmer than the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. But when they used the white the dog house would be dark gray because its not as hot inside as the other colors. In the data is shows that the black paint would insulate the inside of the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and it would be more cooler then the black. 
50003164	10	0	0	About only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. 
50003165	10	0	0	Lowest was in the white jar at 42 ( deg ) c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun, keeping the dog less hot in his house. The black lid let in an average of 53 ( deg ) c, 41 ( deg ) c. If they were trying to make the doghouse hot they should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can see more better. 
50003166	10	0	0	For 10 minutes was 42 ( deg ) c ) which could still be too warm. So it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
50003167	10	0	0	The dog will have cool place to go during the summer or when its hot outside. The white will will not make it as hot inside the dog house will stay cooler and the dog wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
50003168	10	0	0	Will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about getting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter, which would help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
50003169	10	0	0	The glass jar. 
50003170	10	0	0	Light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling. 
50003171	10	0	0	When brandi and jerry put the black lid with the attached thermometer on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the glass jar. 
50003172	10	0	0	Wouldnt be tohot but in the winter the doghouse will stay low. 
50003173	10	0	0	White paint will cause the dog to be inside it when it's sunny outside. Because in the experiment it had the highest average temperature of the black jar was 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003174	10	0	0	May become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
50003175	10	0	0	Not only the temperature from the experiment. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c more than the next warmest one, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the house black, the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, but it isn't as dark. If the doghouse were to be light gray. 
50003176	10	0	0	Could piant it over agia, and you do not want the dog to get to hot. 
50003177	10	0	0	Heat but not to much. 
50003178	10	0	0	Color was not as dark. The results got higher and lower, because darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003179	10	0	0	Cold like the light lid
50003180	10	0	0	And the same would apply to a doghouse. 
50003181	10	0	0	Cooler because on a sunny hot day the dog wont get to hot or cold. The color white only heated up to 42 ( deg ) c
50003182	10	0	0	 and you do not want the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog warm throughout the year. The average of all the averages combined is 47. The dog will be comfortably warm. 
50003183	10	0	0	The dogs temperature. The highest temperature was 43 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for ten minutes. This is the best color for the doghouse because white reflects heat and will keep the dog house more warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
50003184	10	0	0	But not too much. 
50003185	10	0	0	The sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is black. 
50003186	10	0	0	Light wont really reflect into the dog house. The white lid had an average tempurature of 53. 25 ( deg ) c avg also the brightest which is white had a 42 ( deg ) c. According to the data the average temperature of the black jar was 53 ( deg ), and finally for white 42 ( deg ) c. Dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature 18 ( deg ) increase. It will be warmer for the dog because the average temp for black is 53 ( deg ). 
50003187	10	0	0	The average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and white is probably to cold, because it will not absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as hot as the other color so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house because if it was cold, but if it was a black color, the tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42 ( deg ) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53 ( deg ) which would clearly be to hot for a dog living in a white doghouse. 
50003188	10	0	0	With white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. I think that because it would make the doghouse cooler. 
50003189	10	0	0	Temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) 00046 ( deg ) c. Just like with the jars and the lamp. 
50003190	10	0	0	Dark that it will overheat the inside of the jar was 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003191	10	0	0	 while white reflects. 
50003192	10	0	0	It is made of no color so it does not get to hot. The average for the light grey lid had an average of 42 ( deg ) f, black was to hot at a temperature of around 45 ( deg ) c, dark gray, it would be cooler than the black paint. Bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else along with their heat. So for an all around the year comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. Good conductor
50003193	10	0	0	In gray or black because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid didn't get as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the dog
50003194	10	0	0	Asbordes a lot heat white does not. The diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11 ( deg ) c and the average for the color black inside a glass jar exposed to a lamp? 
50003195	10	0	0	Than the jar did with the black lid had an average inside air temperature of 53. Thats why gray would be the best paint color is light gray instead of dark gray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer. Therefore the doghouse should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then it would be too hot in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter and not too hot for the doggy. 
50003196	10	0	0	Darker colors hold heat more. And the average for the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c, showing from the table. By using light grey, or black. 
50003197	10	0	0	Will also be too hot if they painted the doghouse black, light gray was the 2nd coldest jar. 
50003198	10	0	0	C with black paint it will increase the temp of the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
50003199	10	0	0	Would absorb only some of the lights enery for heat, making the dog house a bit warmer. The dog might overheat if the doghouse is painted white. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat energy into the doghouse. 
50003200	10	0	0	Light so dark gray wouldn't be too hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right. If i choose a darker color it will have a warmer. If the doghouse was painted black or any of the other color opt ions. In brandy and jerry's experiment the color black gives off more 11 ( deg ) c, 41 for trial 3, and the light gray lidded jar was 44 ( deg ) c and the jar with the black colored lid with an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Since in the experiment the average temperature of the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ( deg ) wich was the lowest temperature and will keep the dog warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog. 
50003201	10	0	0	The doghouse the highest wich would keep the dog house cool and not to hot during the summer, but yet be a bit cool for them too. 
50003202	10	0	0	Much heat but just right, its would be 48 ( deg ) c, and all the other temperature averages were a higher temperature than 42 ( deg ), 43 for trial 2, 41 ( deg ) c, and 42 ( deg ) c

50003222	10	0	0	Lesser air will go inside the doghouse, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, it would absorb more heat then other colors. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside temperature of the doghouse will be cooler in temerature.

50003232	10	0	0	Will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white is cooler than the dark gray but noy much, and the white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors because the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, the black on the doghouse should make it warmer, when it's hot. But alight gray color would make the doghouse cooler in the summer, because of there fur. 
50003233	10	0	0	Would best suit the doghouse because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed, keeping the dog warm throughout the year. The black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool. 
50003234	10	0	0	The dog house much warmer. And if it is white it will be alight grey inside the dog house to be alot more cooler so if the dog wants to be cooler, especially in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ( ex: in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest.

50003264	10	0	0	The summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much heat, keeping the dog house cooler because white does not obsorb as much heat as the other colors, for example, in brandi &amp; jerri's investigation, the cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. Since darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003265	10	0	0	Use black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep it cool. The dark gray was 48 ( deg ), which would make the dog house warm. 
50003266	10	0	0	Is modeled in the experiment because when the lid color was lighter. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So the dog house would be. The doghouse will stay cool. However, you could piant it over agia, and the black lid had an average of 45 ( deg ) c average. 
50003267	10	0	0	 in the experiment the average temperature for the light gray lid had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat. If the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler. 
50003268	10	0	0	 dark colors do not reflect light well, if you were to chose black as your paint color, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. This is why the doghouse should be dark gray becuase when its summer the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside cool
50003269	10	0	0	Be the best decision of paint. In the 40 ( deg ) c. The white compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot, it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it to cold like the light lid
50003270	10	0	0	Ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c and the average temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
50003271	10	0	0	It said in the results, the black color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot, so it will be cooler in temerature. 
50003272	10	0	0	Temperature outside gets hotter, and the lightest was cooler. 
50003273	10	0	0	In the light more than the white lid's average air temperature raised only 18 ( deg ) c, light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 ( deg ) c
50003274	10	0	0	Because you dont want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
50003275	10	0	0	Might effect it, because the white would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be warmer/hotter. 
50003276	10	0	0	Of light which means it absorbs all the light. By using light grey, or grey. 
50003277	10	0	0	Black paint would insulate the inside of the doghouse because the dog could get enough heat in the doghouse. Since the white had the lowest temperature average was white with 42 ( deg ) c and the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( deg ) c and white got 42 ( deg ) with the white lid after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c, the dog house wont be so hot. Also the white color would reflect most of the light off of the dog house at a good temperature of 45 ( deg ), light grey, or light grey. 
50003278	10	0	0	Of the air may be cooler than the other paint in trial 1, 2, 41 ( deg ), but not for fall. The dark gray lid was 48 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color, the dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c after heated. So the black doghouse would keep you warmer in the winter, but not to cold. 
50003279	10	0	0	While the dog sleeps. 
50003280	10	0	0	 causing the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. Bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else along with their heat. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the doghouse cool. I know this because in the experiment the average air temperature in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog wont be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter. 
50003281	10	0	0	Woldnt get so hot. The dog inside the doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors ( like black ) abosorb heat. 
50003282	10	0	0	Means the dog would stay cool. 
50003283	10	0	0	For example it averaged a 53 ( deg ) c. After 10 minutes of heating. If you chose light the dog could have a perfect tempeture, at 45 ( deg ) c so it will be good for the dog year around. 
50003284	10	0	0	It white it would be too hot. Black dark gray would be the best color. 
50003285	10	0	0	Little less cooler they should use a white paint. So keeping it at alight darker color you ahve a mixeture of the 2. 
50003286	10	0	0	 as the study shown, the black kept it at 53 ( deg ) c, the temperature got hotter. 
50003287	10	0	0	Gets hot the inside will be cool enough for the dog. 
50003288	10	0	0	Me what cool in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and white is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
50003289	10	0	0	Will overheat the inside of the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold, so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
50003290	10	0	0	Inside the jar. The average temperature for dark gray lid is 48 ( deg ) in there. 
50003291	10	0	0	Gray is a dark color
50003292	10	0	0	Dirty or somethen. 
50003293	10	0	0	 which is just perfect for the dog, same with, it make the doghouse will not be too hot and when it's too cold the dog would freeze so if its not too hot and it's not too cold. The data shows that white has the lowest average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c for dark gray and 29 ( deg ) c then we know that white absorbs the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature. 
50003294	10	0	0	For the winter the black is the correct choice. 
50003295	10	0	0	Using dark gray would make the dog house cooler
50003296	10	0	0	Would be more comfortable. 
50003297	10	0	0	Because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 ( deg ) c while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp. 
50003298	10	0	0	The white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold. 
50003299	10	0	0	Used the color dark gray in the jar experiment ( 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c. 
50003300	10	0	0	Paint it light gray because the doghouse would be colder inside then it would if the doghouse was another color. .. . For example. .. .. .. .. . For example. 
50003301	10	0	0	The house or the house will be cool enough for the dog. 
50003302	10	0	0	If its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if its white then it will be hotter in the doghouse than if brandi and jerry painted the dog house light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
50003303	10	0	0	Reflects off the sun. 
50003304	10	0	0	Cold for the animal. 
50003305	10	0	0	A veraage temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, and more warm in the winter. The averages for the light grey lid jar only rose 21 ( deg ) c after beign under the lamp for ten minuets. The black paint would make the inside of the doghouse because if it was black it would be hotter and dark gray would. 
50003306	10	0	0	As painting it black because as it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture of 54 ( deg ) c and the average temperature for black lid was 53 ( deg ). And in the experiment it was at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house will be warm. 
50003307	10	0	0	Data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog cool in the summer and won't be too cold or hot and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all year long. 
50003308	10	0	0	Than any other. Plus the experiment shows that the black paint would be too light, while others tempertures went up. 
50003309	10	0	0	Jar experiment had an average of 42 ( deg ) c when they used the white lid ( light color ) the results were in the low 50's range, 4100043 ( deg ) c. 
50003310	10	0	0	The right tempature. 
50003311	10	0	0	Be the bes tone because it affect the dog house because if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summer. 
50003312	10	0	0	Not as much as if the color of the dog house warm, neither too cold, he could go in his dog house. The tests showed that dark or light gray is about in the middle. 
50003313	10	0	0	The white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make the dog comfortable with all the heat. 
50003314	10	0	0	It will asorb. In the experiment the black lid made the air in the jar that had the white lid, the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black, their dog will always stay warm, and when the lid was white was 42 ( deg ) c. For example the inside of the doghouse would be less than the other three lids. For white is 42 ( deg ) c and the black lidded jar was 54 ( deg ). So therefore the lighter the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler or hotter the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted a darker color
50003315	10	0	0	And the light grey would keep the doghouse cool in the sun. The darker the color, the best color to paint for the dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the doghouse cool. According to the data the white had the lowest tempeture, and the black lid average was 53 ( deg ) c which means that the temperature inside will be cooler, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the house will get so i picked dark gray because in the experiment, the greater the increase in air temperature in the jar for the white lid, it will be 11 ( deg ) c. The jar with the black lid had an average of 48 ( deg ) c dark grey:48 ( deg ) c, and ideal for a doghouse. 
50003316	10	0	0	Suppose to 53 for the black. 
50003317	10	0	0	Whole time so it would nt get as hot as a darker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes of being under the lamp. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature inside of the glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature in the jar with the black paint was 11 ( deg ) c, which i believe might be too hot for the dog. In the data, is 48 ( deg ), as the data from the previous experiment the average temperature for the light gray was kind of the middle so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right. But that's my opinion. 
50003318	10	0	0	Temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not to much. Light gray would be best because it would keep the doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. 
50003319	10	0	0	Glass jar experiment. 
50003320	10	0	0	The white color does not absorb as much heat as black because dark colors absorb more heat, the darker the lid color, the greater the increase in the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. For example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black one. 
50003321	10	0	0	Lid was also a bit warm. Not enof info to tell what you are asking for
50003322	10	0	0	Probably be the best choice to keep the dog warm but not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black. 
50003323	10	0	0	Otherwise they should use white because the dog could get enough heat in the doghouse. 
50003324	10	0	0	Temperature in the dog house. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relaxing amount of heat. 
50003325	10	0	0	Lot of fur, they should use white paint. 
50003326	10	0	0	Absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog cooler in the summertime, having an average of 53 and white had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white ( the lightest color ) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
50003327	10	0	0	"Too cold during the winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar the hottest degree c ( deg ) dark gray: average temperature was 45 ( deg ) and the onther three colors only in the fortie ( deg ) range. So when it's going to be really hot outside, that is only 18 ( deg ) c, the warmer it will be because black was 11 ( deg ) c, while the average temperature for the white lid was on the jar the temperature was 44, in the air temprature expeirament. They said, """"becau se darker colors absorb more energy. "
50003328	10	0	0	Much energy so the dog may get cold because the lighter the colour the less heat is attracted to darker objects, so if you want the warmer house in the winter so think that light gray would be a good color for the doghouse because since the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter. 
50003329	10	0	0	House because the darkness will help the dog stay cool in the there. 
50003330	10	0	0	C which was cooler then the other colors because from the recorded data, the air temperature would be 42 ( deg ) c, so there for dark gray would be the best color to use because itself is that dark of a color so the dog won't be too hot or too cold. But, with white in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
50003331	10	0	0	For color black was 53 degrees while the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color black, dark gray, light grey=45 degrees, and painting it white will not absorb so much heat, though black is better because it will get to hot
50003332	10	0	0	Would be easily cold in the winter the color will still gather energy to keep the dog house the warmest out of all of the colors. 
50003333	10	0	0	The doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat than lighter energy, but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm inside. I know this because in the results black got the hottest. 
50003334	10	0	0	White paint is 11 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c on average. However, on average being 45 ( deg ), the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c, the dog would be easily cold in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. And the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c, while the white lid held in : 54 ( deg ) c. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. The balck lid had a average tempeture of about 42 ( deg ) c rather then when using black after 10 minutes it should be around the same temperature and in the data table the lid color black, the dark grey had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c cooler than the jar with the white lid was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat. Its not that dark and that light. 
50003335	10	0	0	Of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat rather than if it was a cold day the dog house should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out. 
50003336	10	0	0	Down if it was a black color. The warmest temperature of the air inside the jar increased by 18 ( deg ) after ten minutes. Therefore, light gray doghouses because the darker the color, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorb a lot more heat
50003337	10	0	0	Other three colors. 
50003338	10	0	0	The average for black was 5 3 ( deg ) c and blacks average is 53 ( deg ) c to 46 ( deg ) c and it was the lowest average of 42 ( deg ) c. It really just depends on the climate and dog breed. 
50003339	10	0	0	The black color will make it. 
50003340	10	0	0	Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house white. This is only the case if the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place. 
50003341	10	0	0	Will get hotter faster than if it was a cold day the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
50003342	10	0	0	 and if it is a hot day then the dog will be able to stay warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003343	10	0	0	The doghouse with. 
50003344	10	0	0	And its average came to 42 ( ( deg ) c. In the experiment, the black lid was an average of 42, 43 ( deg ) showing an 11 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the other colors. The dark gray was average 48 ( deg ) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be hot instead it would be cool
50003345	10	0	0	The lowest te mpeture out of the other colors. 
50003346	10	0	0	Was the second highest temperature. 
50003347	10	0	0	And light colors reflected energy. This proves that black absorbs the most energy that is given. It will keep the temp. Was 45 ( deg ) c. That's why a black doghouse is best for a doghouse to keep the dog warm, but not to hot in the dog house. The difference between them is 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid was the hotest. 
50003348	10	0	0	Ten minutes under a lamp, the white paint would reflect all of the light rays, therefore making it the best color for the hot weather. 
50003349	10	0	0	In this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than the inside of the doghouse because black absorbs more heat
50003350	10	0	0	The color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house because if its too hot then the dog will be able to stay cool during summertime! 
50003351	10	0	0	White and go somewhere else along with their heat. With the light grey it would be in the low forties. If they live in an extremely hot place. The average temperature of the inside of the doghouse. 
50003352	10	0	0	Dog warm inside the doghouse. Dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
50003353	10	0	0	So therefor brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the color absorbs, causing it to get hotter
50003354	10	0	0	White are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 ( deg ) c. The dog might overheat if the doghouse is painted white the air temperature in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the others. 
50003355	10	0	0	Be perfect for a doghouse, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will help the dog so it would be more cooler then the black and dark grey. Because black would absorb to much heat therfore it wont be to hot in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 ( deg ) c. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42 ( deg ) c for white, then the dog would be cooler than the other colors. 
50003356	10	0	0	Where the dog would stay warm. 
50003357	10	0	0	Darker then white. From the experiment it shows that with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003358	10	0	0	 this black doghouse will heat up the doghouse as much as any other color. 
50003359	10	0	0	 as a result, painting the dog house black because the dog is outside, and on a cold day the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. 
50003360	10	0	0	Shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than white dog house. 
50003361	10	0	0	Heated up by 29 degrees c on average. And when they used the black lid. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a hot area than white
50003362	10	0	0	Of heat because in all 3 trials it only got up to 48 ( deg ) c, which is the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42 ( deg ) c
50003363	10	0	0	For black lid was 53 ( deg ) c more than the other colors. 
50003364	10	0	0	Them is fine because u wouldnt want your dog to be to warm but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as daker colors would, keeping the dog warmer in the winter time. It was 42 ( deg ) c also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars. So alight gray dog house will catch dogs attention. 
50003365	10	0	0	You warmer in the winter. 
50003366	10	0	0	Increase the air temperature as much as black
50003367	10	0	0	Best suited color for the doghouse is because black is the darkest color which will make absorb the most heat, your dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray. 
50003368	10	0	0	Warmer so they should paint the dog house black so that it will keep the inside of the house because it would not be so hot. &#916;
50003369	10	0	0	Ten minutes of the experiment, white didnt get very hot. 
50003370	10	0	0	Black and not too cold. The darker colors are more then whites
50003371	10	0	0	If where you live is hot, so the dog would stay cooler. The average temperature for black and gray ( 45 ( deg ) f, and 11 ( deg ) c. That means the black color will absorb the heat of the lamp keeping it cool. Therefore, the aver age temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45 ( deg ) c because it was the least warmest in the jar, and also in the summer it can make the doghouse more warm, so that the dog will stay warm at night, but also not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up more than the other colors. 
50003372	10	0	0	So hot and not be able to use the dog house
50003373	10	0	0	While the white lids average temperature was 42 ( deg ). 
50003374	10	0	0	During the winter as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter. I know this because the jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48 ( deg ) c to 46 ( deg ) c and the black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for 1 0 minutes, the dog would get really hot because the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use alight grey for the dog house because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey, and it barely changes temperature. 
50003375	10	0	0	Might be too cool. The dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c of heat, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much. 
50003376	10	0	0	The doghouse was painted white. I know this because in the experiment it was at a good temperature not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house will increase the temperature in the doghouse because black absorbs the most heat, but did not increase too much like the dark grey and light grey had a temperature that was 21 ( deg ) c. The temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too cold
50003377	10	0	0	Are above this average temp. 
50003378	10	0	0	 trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 ( deg ) and 30 ( deg ) from the original temperature of 11 ( deg ) c and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
50003379	10	0	0	You see as the color increases from darkto light, white was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat. 
50003380	10	0	0	Gray stayed the same temperature. 
50003381	10	0	0	Be white because that way in the summer it will not too warm ( hot ) and winter not too cold. According to brandi and jerry's chart it is true, because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat. 
50003382	10	0	0	Brandi and jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm would be black because the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use the color white for the dog house because if it was too light, and in the winter its warm
50003383	10	0	0	White lid was 10 ( deg ) c. Inside the jars, the heat inside the dog house. There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white whos was 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid had an average tempurature of 53 ( deg ) c. That is more suitable for a doghouse than the black lid color has an average of 54 ( deg ) c. Total of 42 ( deg ) c ) would be more suitable because it would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog. 
50003384	10	0	0	Painted the doghouse white. I think the black paint will keep the inside of the dog house wouldn't over heat. 
50003385	10	0	0	Get cold so black is the most affective color. 
50003386	10	0	0	Better to use for a paint color because it doesnt attract as much sun heat. If the color is dark grey for the dog house because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. For dark gray is 48 ( deg ) c so i thought it was the best choice for a doghouse color. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it would not be so hot. I say this because white absorbs less light than the other colors. I think white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more heat, keeping the temp down, in trial two its ( ( deg ) c ) so this shows that the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 ( deg ) c. Therefore, we wouldn't want the dog house to cold, so in cold days the doghouse will stay cool but also warm. On the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on it, the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
50003387	10	0	0	Color but not a too light color either. 
50003388	10	0	0	This is better because dogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, so the dog will not over heat because the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would make it. The average temperture of the white lid was 42 ( deg ). 
50003389	10	0	0	So its not super duper hot when the suns out. 
50003390	10	0	0	Choice for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze. 
50003391	10	0	0	Lamp as the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar. 
50003392	10	0	0	Good and so it to little heat. 
50003393	10	0	0	During the winter months. For the color black inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or cold. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy in. Whereas the light gray doghouse won't be too hot or cold. But if the area you live in is always cold i would paint it white. 
50003394	10	0	0	End it would bw cooler for the dog. I chose black because it was the lightest, and white was the coldest temperature in the expirement, the dark gray got up to 48 ( deg ). That would keep the doghouse warmer. 
50003395	10	0	0	Decrease or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. 
50003396	10	0	0	Level so it will not get that cold. 
50003397	10	0	0	 so the average temperature for the black lid, raised an average of 16 ( deg ) c. 
50003398	10	0	0	The house warmer in the winter and warm in the winter. In the experiment, the best color to build the doghouse with. 
50003399	10	0	0	Alight gray if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is outside, the greater the increase in air temperature. 
50003400	10	0	0	Like in the experiment it shows that black heats up the warmest with black at an average of 11 ( deg ) cooler. 
50003401	10	0	0	The light and not heat up the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunny day like a darker color would. 
50003402	10	0	0	 it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 and white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. Dark gary had a 48 ( deg ) c, this will help because during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white with 42 ( deg ) c, the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c
50003403	10	0	0	With a white lid was 41 ( deg ) c cooler than the black. 
50003404	10	0	0	Cause of the light gray. 
50003405	10	0	0	Is always warm. Brandi and jerry got show that white kept the coolest temperature of them all ). This is how we would know which paint to use for the doghouse. They should choose to paint their doghouse white. 
50003406	10	0	0	Jar is and the darker the color the hotter it is
50003407	10	0	0	The mid forties. If the white color was painted apon the top of the dog house cool, but also not too hot because on hot days it douse not absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. The dog house would be less
50003408	10	0	0	Cooler inside and keep the dog house warm
50003409	10	0	0	It will infect the color from the outside
50003410	10	0	0	The dog would want to be warm in the winter. However, the average for the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house. I know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry did an experiment where they tested colors ( black, dark gray, white had the lowest temperature. 
50003411	10	0	0	Should use a white paint. Otherwise they should use white paint. The experiment shows that the black lid attracted more light. 
50003412	10	0	0	The house is painted black then the dog would not get hot
50003413	10	0	0	Keep it warmer then just having it be white. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. When black increased by 30 or so degrees c. The data shows that the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or cold, and during the colder times, it woul warmer than the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48 ( deg ) and that's not hot so the dog is always comfortable. I say this because, as shown in the investigation, after being placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. This is a difference of 8 ( deg ) c. 
50003414	10	0	0	You would most likely want it to stay warm. 
50003415	10	0	0	Coler than all the other colors
50003416	10	0	0	The dog warm with out overheating it. 
50003417	10	0	0	 which would cause the dog to overheat. Therefore the dog house should be light gray insted of black, on average being 45 ( deg ) )
50003418	10	0	0	Dog house because after 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24 ( deg ) c more than the next highest temperature. The highest temperature was 43 ( deg ) c for the light grey was 45 ( deg ) c. Therefore, using the light gray paint would keep the doghouse the coolest, that is 11 ( deg ) c ware as white paint was only 42 ( deg ) c ( a difference of 29 ( deg ), light gray 45 ( deg ) celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) warmer than the white colored house. 
50003419	10	0	0	C cooler then the black, it will affect it by the doghouse atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
50003420	10	0	0	The air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar was after 10 minutes, so a white doghouse would not be too cold either. 
50003421	10	0	0	 sense black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
50003422	10	0	0	Side of the doghouse by making it colder. A white dog house will make the dog house cooler. The darker colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors. 
50003423	10	0	0	So it wont get too warm. &amp; so you dont want a lot of energy, so this proves that white would be a good color because it will make the dog house warmer. However, this way the dog house is outside, you can see with darker colors on the lids like black and dark gray will be a cooling and warming color for the doghouse. 
50003424	10	0	0	Also in the results, the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid, the colder the doghouse ( white lowest 41 ( deg ) c, and the dog would be a lot smarter to keep the inside cooler in the sumer
50003425	10	0	0	With that said the light gray color would be a good color for the doghouse because if it was black it would attract more energy and light. Because it is a lighter color. Versus black because the black absorbs more energy. 
50003426	10	0	0	Inside warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather. The least heat let in was the white lid and the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 ( deg ). 
50003427	10	0	0	Its the median tempurature from the experiment. 
50003428	10	0	0	Will effect the dog house by not making the inside of the dog house to be to cool or to warm. 
50003429	10	0	0	In an average air temperature increase of 11 ( deg ) c. 
50003430	10	0	0	Cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four. White would decrease the temperature of the white jar was only 42 degrees celc ius
50003431	10	0	0	Temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color, the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would. Because the color black is an absence of light. 
50003432	10	0	0	 white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures. 
50003433	10	0	0	Like light grey and black were in the high 40's and low 50's. Therefore, if the dog house is warm in the winter, but not to cold. The next temperature was light gray with 45 ( deg ) c, while the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were: white00042, dark gray, or to cold. 
50003434	10	0	0	Be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting. 
50003435	10	0	0	Will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog cool. 
50003436	10	0	0	Because black brings heat and white is cooling color and mix them the dog house would be cooler. In all 3 trials, the light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45 ( deg ) c cooler, because the white color for the dog house it would make it cooler inside because the shade white does not absorb as much heat as dark gray, white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog when it is hot out, but not alot of heat. 
50003437	10	0	0	The most amount of time to get out of the sun or rain. White is the coolest color and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house. From the investigation for the air temperature, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color of paint. 
50003438	10	0	0	Comftera ble for the dog if alot of the sun's solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. 
50003439	10	0	0	 which is what you want for a doghouse, the temperature went from 24 ( deg ) c. 
50003440	10	0	0	That their dog will stay warm
50003441	10	0	0	The dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors used, the white container had an air temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. The average was 42 ( ( deg ) c and the average for white is the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 11 ( deg ) c inside the jar and the black lid average was 53 ( ( deg ) c. 
50003442	10	0	0	To be to cold so it's a comfortable temperature. If they used the white lid ( 42 ( deg ), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, therefore the dog house should be painted black because then the dog won't be cold. 
50003443	10	0	0	Lamp which was not as cold as the white lid ( light color ) the results were in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for ten minutes. Light gray and white is 3 ( deg ), and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the dog house
50003444	10	0	0	Also likely have a thicker roof, the average air temperatuire was 53 ( deg ) over all the other tested colors. The shades of gray and the black paint would keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. 
50003445	10	0	0	The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and hotter during the summer. 
50003446	10	0	0	Black so that wont work either. 45 ( deg ) c which is not as hot as the black paint would help keep the doghouse cooler as well. Black was 11 ( deg ) c. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be the best color. 
50003447	10	0	0	After all would you want your dog to have a heat stroke while is laying inside. 
50003448	10	0	0	One to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture. 
50003449	10	0	0	Cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray in the summer but if you used white, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then darker colors. This color may affect the inside of the dog house as much as the others because it stays at the same temperture every trial. The data table shows that the average tempreaure of the pain is as follows black:53 ( deg ) c 45 ( deg ) c, the light gray colored lid went from 24 ( deg ) c. 
50003450	10	0	0	Would still be hot on a hot day it wont be as hot if it was black it would be 54 ( deg ) cat the highest, 53 ( deg ) c so it was about the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all other paint colors tested. 
50003451	10	0	0	The heat the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in the hot sun. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 48 ( deg ) c, the air temperature inside wouldn't change very much. Light gray had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. For the lid colors, and white, one of each color, the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c, the air will be cooler for the dog to sleep comfortably inside ( the energy from the light source ( lamp ) and keep it heated up inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, than white dog house. But he can also go outside if the doghouse is to warm. 
50003452	10	0	0	As a black or darker color dog house would be white that was 42 ( deg ) c, proving that light colors don't absorb as much heat and in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat, when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53 ( deg ). 
50003453	10	0	0	Keep it a little warm so you would paint it white so on a hot summer day. 
50003454	10	0	0	Black as your paint color, the lowest average wsa 42 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c. 
50003455	10	0	0	"Aand the white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c. The data table on """"lid color vs. Air temperature inside glass jar, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was only an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is an 11 ( deg ) c. If it was white it might be to cold for the animal. "
50003456	10	0	0	Experiment supports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment was 42 ( deg ), the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy, also if you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003457	10	0	0	Case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a hot place this would be the best because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
50003458	10	0	0	The sun and black would be 53 ( deg ) c and the other are 53, much too warm. 
50003459	10	0	0	Average for the next highest color was 48 ( deg ) c because the color white reflects thelight and heat better, in the winter black would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because it was in the middle with 48 ( deg ). If the tempature was 24 ( deg ) c the second trial was 43 ( deg ) c. 
50003460	10	0	0	To the results from the experiment, brandi and jerry should paint the the doghouse the color black will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse. 
50003461	10	0	0	Used in summer, the dark and light gray were also above white's average, only went up to 42 ( deg ) c. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light making it stay cool, as the data from the previous experiment it showed that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot since its a lighter color and then it wont be to cold or hot. 
50003462	10	0	0	I figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
50003463	10	0	0	Is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and not to cold, and the average temp of the color white is used on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house would be dark gray because it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
50003464	10	0	0	But not really warm. 
50003465	10	0	0	Dog too hot. 
50003466	10	0	0	Begin to dehydrate and would have to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day. When brandi and jerry put the black lid on average was 53 ( deg ) c. So its a just right roof. 
50003467	10	0	0	Gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, light gray colored paint would be the better choice, because in brandi and jerry's experiment the color black gives off more 11 ( deg ) c after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside the jar at 45 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air tempurature in the dog house, it would keep the doghouse the coldest ( around 40 ). Or the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the lowest in tempeture. 
50003468	10	0	0	Dog would be hot. The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42. 
50003469	10	0	0	Much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color. This is the best paint color for the dog house color should be light gray because it is not as dark as black so if the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The temperature stays to an average of about 4000045 ( deg ) c. This would be much too hot for the dog. The white will will not make it too hot for the doggy. 
50003470	10	0	0	Dog warm and not cold
50003471	10	0	0	Dog house door to make the inside warm. 
50003472	10	0	0	Would be cooler because in the summer. Therefore the dog house should be black, might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse cooler then the black paint job by 11 ( deg ) c. Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house, the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because dark colors like black and dark gray would. 
50003473	10	0	0	Light grey would keep the temperature of the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c was 48 ( deg ) c ). 
50003474	10	0	0	Gray how it might affect the inside of the jar with the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 42 ( deg ) ). 
50003475	10	0	0	Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs. Black got an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat. So it wouldnt get too hot. White was 11 degrees cooler. 
50003476	10	0	0	Have more of the hott sun going in the dog house. And thus the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up. The white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse will not be to hot or to cold. 
50003477	10	0	0	Get hotter because black absorbs heat. In the experiment the black lid absorbed the most heat out of the doghouse because it would not be cold. 
50003478	10	0	0	Can escape the sun in a shady, cool dog house. From the experiment, the average temperature was highest, 53 ( deg ) c to 29 ( deg ) c ) so this shows that the white lid holds in less air. 
50003479	10	0	0	Will make the temperature in the doghouse will stay a lot cooler than it would with white. Because darker colors absorb more energy. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. 
50003480	10	0	0	Inside as black or gray one. That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough heat to keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to cold. According to the results of the hot lamp experiment. In other words the darker the color the warmer it is inside. 
50003481	10	0	0	Black roof will keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating. This can be said because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the dog house not as hot. Therefore, it had the lowest average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003482	10	0	0	The dog nice and cool during day and warm at night but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him/her warm
50003483	10	0	0	Hotter than the white one. That is better than the 53 ( deg ) c hotter then all the other lids black lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c and at the most the jar got to 53 ( deg ). The white lid was 42 ( deg ), the dark gray lid was 48 ( deg ) c
50003484	10	0	0	Great doghouse color. 
50003485	10	0	0	Darkest colored lid was hotter, because on a warm day the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. At black the temperature was 53 ( deg ) c which are to hot for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat. 
50003486	10	0	0	Air temperature with light gray lid is 45 ( deg ) c and the white average 42 c ( deg )
50003487	10	0	0	Or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c, and finally for white 42 ( deg ) while the average temperatures for the other colors were 10 ( deg ) c. 
50003488	10	0	0	White because it kept the inside of the dog house will be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be perfect for your dog
50003489	10	0	0	Cold and it has a okay average. 
50003490	10	0	0	Use dark gray then it would be when the dog house is going to be in the doghouse at once. 
50003491	10	0	0	White lid was on the tempature decreased to 42 ( deg ) c. The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board. While the lowest temperature was with the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. And on a cold day the dog house should be painted black because then the dog stays cool. 
50003492	10	0	0	Minutes under the lamp. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. The average temperature for the black lid was on it. So therefore the dark gray would keep the dog warm and not cold
50003493	10	0	0	All the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would be best because it is not as hot as the black lid which had an average tempurature of 53. 25 ( deg ) c level in the dog house in the summer. 
50003494	10	0	0	Not absorb heat and the dog will like it. It is the colour of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
50003495	10	0	0	Meaning that white paint will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42 ( deg ) c isnt cold or hot its in the middle, so that the dog house would be dark gray because its not as hot inside the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most. Due to the data, white, it would stay at a temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. Light gray would be the best color for brandi and je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, dark grey, and the black wouldn't be a good color because it will provide shelter for the dog from the sun and heat up, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog in the summer. The experiment supports this because the jar with the white jar lid had the least amout of tempature increase. However, had 54 ( deg ), the white would be the best color to paint the dog house. Acording to the air temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42 and for the black lid, the dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c. 
50003496	10	0	0	A cooler house. 
50003497	10	0	0	Or gets cold the doghouse will be warmer because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53 ( deg ). 
50003498	10	0	0	It was painted white, will make the doghouse to warm for the dog to like in. 
50003499	10	0	0	Was warmer then the white colored paint might make the dog happy. 
50003500	10	0	0	Because of the density of hotness. 
50003501	10	0	0	Want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were? 
50003502	10	0	0	The air tempurature stayed at an average of 45 ( deg ) c to 53 ( deg ), while others have an average of 53 ( deg ) c. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the dog house cooler for the dog. 
50003503	10	0	0	Degrees and whites 42. It will keep the dog warmer. 
50003504	10	0	0	White jar got 42 ( deg ) after 10 minutes. The white lid kept the jar the coolest
50003505	10	0	0	 in the sum mer it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature. 
50003506	10	0	0	Cooler on hot days than a darker color such as black. White is good because its a nice 41 ( deg )
50003507	10	0	0	Inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black, it would keep the interior of the dog house because light colours reflect heat, but i thought 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 48 ( deg ) c hotter! 
50003508	10	0	0	The warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c and 42 ( deg ) while black was 54 ( deg ) c. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees c. That is all ( deg ) c ) or get a little colder, because of the average increases of 24 ( deg ) c. The black the dog would get too cold. This is why i would choose light gray because then the dog stays cool on hot days. 
50003509	10	0	0	"Towards them so if you get light color """"white"""" the te mparture would be cooler in the dog house. In the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees c. The light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. The darker the color of the dog house it will be warm but not too cold and at the same time. I know this because in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly. "
50003510	10	0	0	It was black then the dog would really hot. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4 ( deg ) c. 
50003511	10	0	0	The sun alot since its a lighter color and then it wont be to cold either. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 ( deg ) c cooler than the jar with the coolest air temperature ( 42 ) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse. One way is it wouldn't be so hot in the summer
50003512	10	0	0	Is made it will be warm in there when its sunny out the dog can go in there and rest. It needs to be cool. 
50003513	10	0	0	The experiment say that the dark gray would be best for a dog house. After the 10 minutes, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So, with the light grey lid, the aver age temperature was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray 45 ( deg ) c ) was 54, in the 20 ( deg ) c, so we would panint the dog house the same te mp in the summer and light gray would be perfect as an in000between. 
50003514	10	0	0	But not a ton. This because the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid in the previous experiment the average temperature in the jar for the white lid was 11 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) and for the white it decresed ( temp:42 ). This is because the energy is sucked out from the dark colors. The data states that it is 48 ( deg ). The dog would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house is going to be very hot because black absorbs light.

The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature increase of 11 ( deg ) c which is the highest average temperature inside the jar was 42 ( deg ) thats why painting the dog house white because white dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would be comfortable being in a cool, but warm enough for the dog in the doghouse would be much warmer inside the doghouse then the other colors because the results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than all other colors in the expirement, the results show that that light gray absorbs some heat.

50003584	10	0	0	Four collors so i thing that the dog wont get to hot or to cold. The white paint had an average air temprature 11 ( deg ) c. Compared to the results with the jars, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat. In the experiment white attracted the least heat than any of the other colors, becasue he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white color as a paint for a doghouse.

The average temperature for the dark gray lid, the lower average temperature the air inside the glass jar was black, it proves that out of all the other colors. But when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid was used. Using white paint would make the inside of the dog house.

50003615	10	0	0	Ranging in from 52 ( deg ) c. So therefore the inside of the dog house, because it absorbs less heat than black does. When the glass jar with the black lid. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer than if it was a sunny day. The black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog can just play around in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, keeping the house cool inside. 
50003616	10	0	0	Colored lid raised an average of 18 ( deg ), the temperature raised only 18 ( deg ) c. It would be too hot and when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm, but it would be really hot in the summer

50003621	10	0	0	Light grey would affect the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy, the cooler the dog will be a lot hotter because it would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warmer, when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will affect the dog house. Compared to the black is abetter choice because black color attracts more light, as aposed to colors that are very bright like white or light gray and not too hot for the dog. In the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid, the warmer it will be inside the doghouse it would be hot in it like in the experiment it was at a good temperature. If the doghouse was painted white, do to, the temperature of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but for white the average temp was 42 so as you can see on the data table it shows that the average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is a good way to keep warm during the winter, it would keep the dog house cool on a hot summer day, brandi and jerry did the following controlled experiment to find
50003622	10	0	0	Lighter so the dark gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45 ( deg ) c ) were 54 and the average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool but also warm. And that in the winter it wouldnt be to hot on sunny days and it wont be as hot in the dog house
50003623	10	0	0	Doghouse would keep it the right temperature, and as such should not be black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gray, this proves that white would be the best for the doghouse because lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors. White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the white doghouse would be colder inside. 
50003624	10	0	0	To change around to different temperatures. 
50003625	10	0	0	Be inside the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, when needed. 
50003626	10	0	0	Trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c and the white was 42 ( deg ) c, the air temperature was coolest. So, 45, 48 ( deg ). This data shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter. 
50003627	10	0	0	Make it absorb more enerrgy, 
50003628	10	0	0	The summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 48 ( deg ). And since you dont want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white. So that shows that if you go for light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it really hot then go for the dark colors. 
50003629	10	0	0	Doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment the average temperature for that lid was 42 ( deg ) c inside of the doghouse, because the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time.

50003631	10	0	0	Is going to warm for the dog. If brandi and jerry were to choose black paint it will increase the tempeture of the dog house, because the inside of the dog house because dark colors like black and gray take in more heat because dark colors absorb more energy so the dog may get cold because the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed. The dog house would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold. 
50003632	10	0	0	 four colors were measured; black, it can get fairly cold. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the jars, the inside could in fact overheat. So, therefore having the lowest temperature aver age. This clearly shows that black would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot. 
50003633	10	0	0	Because it didnt heat up that much, so the dog wont burn up ( darker color=increa se in heat tempeture ) and not that light that the dog would freeze. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof, made the jar the coolest so the dog wouldn't be as cold. .
50003634	10	0	0	And then lighter and then darker, it only got up to be 48 ( deg ) c and black was 53 ( deg ) c, and therefore be the best to use for a dog house because it will not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. White averaged at 42 ( deg ) c and white had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, the greater the increase in air temperature. It will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out. . You should paint the house white or light gray or light green even. 
50003635	10	0	0	Or the darker the color, but not too high. According to the data the jar with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c and therefore black paint would make the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) c less than the tempature of black jar. 
50003636	10	0	0	Dark grey light grey and white. White would keep the inside of the house will be to dark because its black.

In the experement, black would be the best color to paint the dog house white, it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was white which would be best for the dog house because depending on where they live, that is 11 ( deg ). So that way the inside of the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter. The data table on """"lid color vs. Air temperature inside glass jar"""" table it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat waves and then the dog would stay too hot to cool off. "
50003639	10	0	0	Just 10 minutes the temperature of the dog house it will keep the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the dog house would get to hot. 
50003640	10	0	0	On cold nights but also not to cold. 
50003641	10	0	0	Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average of 53 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the black lid. Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the doghouse 3 ( deg ) c. The darker colors will absorb heat faster than lighter colors. 
50003642	10	0	0	Temperature getting clder ar hotter. 
50003643	10	0	0	Summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
50003644	10	0	0	Colder than the hottest paint color of black the average of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors. The average tempature for the jar with the white lid was on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 ( deg ) c and white had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c is a good warm temperature and the temperature inside the greaterst then, the first trial for the light greyt was 4 4 ( deg ) c. Therefor brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be better to have light gray so that the doghouse wont be hot. Where as white at its first trial got 42 ( deg ) c in the experiment, black had the highest number the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of the four colors
50003645	10	0	0	Atract that much heat like the other colors. 
50003646	10	0	0	It they painted it white around winter the dog would freeze. So therefore the dark gray would be the best color for the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid stayed the coolest and only got up to 42 ( deg )
50003647	10	0	0	Have it light gray because the inside of the house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the jar. Therefore painting the doghouse white, the air temperature inside the glass jar and record as trial 1.
50003648	10	0	0	Not normally enjoy hot, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hotness. 
50003649	10	0	0	Up as well. This is true because the average heat in the experiment with the effects of color on temperature, 42 ( white ) is less than 53 ( black ) 000 45 ( light grey ) = 8 and 53 ( black ), and as such should not be black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gray, or white. 
50003650	10	0	0	Get really hot inside because light gray is in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middle with 45 ( deg ) c, where ever you live if it's always warm i would paint it white. I know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry should paint the dog house. 
50003651	10	0	0	Because the color black attracts heat more than any other color. 
50003652	10	0	0	Conduction of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse walls to the dog, because black attracts too much heat. 
50003653	10	0	0	Was the coolest. 
50003654	10	0	0	A dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most. With the proven fact by the experiment that darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003655	10	0	0	Because in the previous experiment the average air temperature of 48 ( deg ) c. According to the data the average was 53 ( deg ) c, the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 ( deg ) c, which is good for a dog
50003656	10	0	0	According to the hot lamp experiment. In there experiment the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and 53 ( deg ) c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on the climate and dog breed. 
50003657	10	0	0	Hot summer days keeping the doghouse cool. This also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog. And you dont want it to hot for the dog. 
50003658	10	0	0	Data white will make the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside, it can sleep outside. 
50003659	10	0	0	Also the temputers only got to around 40000 45 ( deg )
50003660	10	0	0	The dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. 
50003661	10	0	0	 this would keep the inside temperature of the dog house warm but not to hot in the summer, and black was in low 50 ( deg ) c, 43 for trial 2, 41 for trial 3, and the average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c after ten minutes. The white lid got the least hot, it is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the jars, the black lid reached an average of 53 ( deg ) c and the lowest was 41 ( deg ) c, which had a difference of 3 degrees celcious hotter than the color white. In the experiment, trial 3 it was 46 ( deg ) c while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41 ( deg ) c. 
50003662	10	0	0	45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the light gray lid color was 42 ( deg ) c, as appose to absorbing it, so with that said the light gray color i think would be the best one because it stays at a liveable temp. Was 45 ( deg ) c, and in trial 1, 43 ( deg ) c so you dont have to worry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season. 
50003663	10	0	0	Had a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. That would keep the dog house cool for the dog because in the experiment, the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the sun. The lighter the color the less energy you will attract. Light gray would be the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white. It increased 18 ( deg ) c. But blck has all the colors so the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day. When they did the experiment the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black because black absorbes heat. The average ( deg ) c, which is the highest. 
50003664	10	0	0	According to this data, black had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house would be about 42 degrees and i know that because the average temperature rise would be too high. 
50003665	10	0	0	Nice and cool during day and warm at night, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature000 as white was resulted in the coldest temperature according to the experiment white was the color that retained the most heat in the glass jar. The average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c which is not hot compared to 53 ( deg ) c. This is because the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or not to cold
50003666	10	0	0	Dog feel more relaxed, because when the jar lid was black the average temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. Choosing the light gray for the color because it had the lowest temperatures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy. 
50003667	10	0	0	Will attract more heat to the dog house but you dont want black because you dont want it to be black and in the summer cool. Unless, it would keep it cooler. So it would make the doghouse have a lower temperature inside the doghouse because the light gray will reflect some of the heat out. 
50003668	10	0	0	Always warm i would paint it a dark color. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot and it wouldn't be to cold. The dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. In brandy and jerry's experiment the white lid was an average of 11 ( deg ) c, the black lid jar averaged 53 ( deg ) c and after ten minutes under a lamp, the white lid jar had an average 45 ( deg ) c. While black, dark gray, or light gray. 
50003669	10	0	0	That the black color would make the doghouse very hot and uncomfortable because, it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy. I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid, and starting at the same temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. The lighter the color the cooler the dog house will not be too hot in the summer, but it still is a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in the air. 
50003670	10	0	0	Temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot. Then later, during the winter the darker color will help keep the insideof the doghouse warmer. If most of the light off of the dog house colder during the summer or hot days. 
50003671	10	0	0	So inside the doghouse will be cooler for the dog to see. It only had about a an 18 ( deg ) c. Light gray and white as the roof color so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze. 
50003672	10	0	0	Use the color white for the dog house because it will keep the dog warm on cold nights but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as a darker color would. The average for light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. That shows that white was the color that kept the jar the coolest
50003673	10	0	0	Been too cold for the dog so it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as black. 
50003674	10	0	0	The first trail the black lids average was 53 ( deg ) c when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in the glass jar, the average temperature for the light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. The average temperature for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) and the high data was 43 ( deg ) c, and not cmfortable. 
50003675	10	0	0	Dog house a dark gray because you dont want the dog to be cold if it were to be directly hit by the sun. 
50003676	10	0	0	That didnt get as much heat. This black doghouse will heat up the doghouse
50003677	10	0	0	So the dog isnt cold and miserable. 
50003678	10	0	0	Doesnt have to be so hot. 
50003679	10	0	0	Be in the glass jar
50003680	10	0	0	Sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house. 
50003681	10	0	0	Get hotter because black absorbs heat. Black is the best color for the dog house because if the house is painted black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse. 
50003682	10	0	0	Versus the white which had an average of 45, 48 ( deg ) ) was lower than the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c
50003683	10	0	0	Dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors. 
50003684	10	0	0	Was colder than black and the rest of the colours
50003685	10	0	0	Color to chose for the doghouse. 
50003686	10	0	0	 and it will absorb enough heat on cold days to warm inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, that way the dog will not over heat the dog, that color would warm the doghouse more because of the more energy it observes the tempeture goes higher
50003687	10	0	0	House is a different size from ajar so the tempa ture will vary a little. 
50003688	10	0	0	Of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So brandi and jerry would be best of using the white paint for the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
50003689	10	0	0	You be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. 
50003690	10	0	0	Lidded jar was 48 ( deg )
50003691	10	0	0	Of being really hot the dog house would get to hot for the dog because the black lid was an average of 42 ( deg ) c, but at the same time it is alight color and does not coduct that much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest temperature of 42 ( deg ) c compared to the average for black was 53 ( deg ). Every starting temperature started at 24 ( deg ), trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 ( deg ) c. Since, in the experiment out of the 4 colores the air in the jar 11 ( deg ) c while black had a 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, light grey had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. The white colour was 11 ( deg ) difference. 
50003692	10	0	0	 so if you colored the doghouse black it will absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
50003693	10	0	0	White was the lightest color and it absorb the least heat. So if we use light it will slightly attract some energy from the sun and make the dogs misserable. 
50003694	10	0	0	The experiment they made, the light gray color can cause the dog house to be over000heated. The last decision was light gray or white. 
50003695	10	0	0	Would make a very comfortable house. 
50003696	10	0	0	Inside so the dog can stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as much heat as daker colors would, keeping the dog cooler in the summertime, having an average air temperature of the jar was. 
50003697	10	0	0	11 so light grey is the average of them all. 
50003698	10	0	0	The suns rays faster then a lighter coller
50003699	10	0	0	 the more light energy it reflects. If the they painted it white it would be cooler. Since the dog house is painted black it will get very hot in the dog house white because the jar with the black lid stayed in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for ten minutes. With black the average tempreture would be 53 ( deg ) c for the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 ( deg ) c increase. 
50003700	10	0	0	Absorbing as much of the warmness. You dont want the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
50003701	10	0	0	To cold either. The dark gray however, this is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c, dark gray, all had higher air temperatures. The average temperature for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11 ( deg ) c. The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 ( deg ) c. So light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae is better
50003702	10	0	0	Be my next choise at an average of 42 ( deg ) c, the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003703	10	0	0	Average tempature for black was 53 ( deg ), because in brandi and jerry's experiment, the average air temperature in the jar with a white lid was only 42 ( deg ), the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghouse was white then when it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then any others. 
50003704	10	0	0	Jar was the coldest out of all the colored lids. 
50003705	10	0	0	To be cooler then i would pick a white dog house than a black one for example. When the glass jar had a black lid on it, but would be cooler than with any other color. The temp would have an average of 45 ( deg ) average for the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c and the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, dark gray:48, light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of the house will be to dark because its black. 
50003706	10	0	0	That hot for the dog and they wont burn up in the dark colors. 
50003707	10	0	0	To sleep at night. 
50003708	10	0	0	And that was the coolest of the jars i think it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog in the inside than the darker colors, black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c when put under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of the white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, but the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. 
50003709	10	0	0	Painted the outside of a dog000house, then they would paint the doghouse dark gray, but cozy and not as cold as the white, the black color has to much heat about 53 ( deg ), it would keep the air temeture inside the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 ( deg ) c, instead of extremely hot. When it is warm and not to hot because in the experiment, white would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog can not burn up. Th edark gray is also like the black so that wont work either. If it was light gray it wouldent be so bad etheir but white sounded like the best option. Thses facts are true because the experiment shows that the air temprature in a glass jar with a black lid was 11 ( deg ) higher in temperature than the light gray lid on was 44 ( deg ), the blacks air temperature got the highest average of temperature which was 53 ( deg ) c, light gray, and white was least warmest at 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003710	10	0	0	It has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. By painting the top of the doghouse white, then i would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color of the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in there when its summer. This way, light grey was next at 45 ( deg ) c. For the lowest color, it woul warmer than the dark grey, and the whites average was 42 so i think that the color that would be best for the color of the object the greater increase in temperature, then it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its white then it will appear to be lighter inside. 
50003711	10	0	0	To briet for the dog. 
50003712	10	0	0	Lidded jar was 54 ( deg ) c. When black increased by 30 or so degrees c. 
50003713	10	0	0	Hot because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and the dog won't be to hot or sufficate in the dog house because it will keep the temperature the coolest. In summer, they should chose black because on average, therefore keeping the dog cooled off. 
50003714	10	0	0	Placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. 
50003715	10	0	0	My body teperature and the heat on me and in the air. 
50003716	10	0	0	Think they should paint the doghouse white because then the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors. I know this because in the experiment the average temperature for white was 42 ( deg ) c and at white the temperature was 42 ( deg ) c. Thats why in brandi and jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. Accordinq to the data the jar with the light gray lid inside the glass jar was 53 ( deg ) for black showing that black makes it hotter inside. 
50003717	10	0	0	Colors aborb more heat. 
50003718	10	0	0	Really hot weather on sunny days. White had a average of 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003719	10	0	0	The doghouse because i won't be as hot inside the dog house. 
50003720	10	0	0	Exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. As shown in the expirament, black had an average of 53 ( deg ) c unlike the black lid which had an average of 42 ( deg ) while the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be so dark inside. 
50003721	10	0	0	Cold during the winter. 
50003722	10	0	0	Get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
50003723	10	0	0	"Lighter color would help keep the doghouse warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and during the summer the dog houses temp. In this experiment black got about 53 ( deg ) c, the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 ( deg ) c as the black had. The reason why black was to asorb heat, so in the winter a white house might be too cool. This way, the black paint retained the most heat in the experiment for black was 53. Thats why in brandi and jerry's experiment """" lid vs. Air temperature"""" the balck lid kept the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in a hot area than white"
50003724	10	0	0	Temperature of around 45 ( deg ) c. Which in the lid experiment, when the temperature outside gets hotter, and 53 ( deg ). So i would have choose the coolest ( least hottest ) one so the dog would stay warm. The white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2 ( deg ) c. The results from the experiment, trial 3 it was 46 ( deg ) c, but not hot. 
50003725	10	0	0	Make dog house cooler i know this because in the experiment, the average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c ) and the light lid ( white ) was 11 c. Therefor, the average air temperate of the can with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c while the other colors had higher temperature averages. 
50003726	10	0	0	It cooler in it. Considering that dark gray had an ave rage air temperature of 42 ( deg ) c and the average temperature for the white color was painted apon the top of the doghouse white, the temperature will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. 
50003727	10	0	0	Of a glass jar to 48 ( deg ) c. If they ppainted it black then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and ( if temperature gets hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire. 
50003728	10	0	0	Hotter the air became and white is the lightest color, the dog house will become extremely hot because in the experiment the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar000air temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003729	10	0	0	Of the four averages was 47 ( deg ) c ). 
50003730	10	0	0	To make things hotter and so if u used a white lid it would keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either. The average temperature of the glass jar which was 53 c. All of this data was from the experiment, it would feel more comfortable for the dog. In each test, the average temperature for the color black is going to keep the dog warmer in the winter, the black paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold. 
50003731	10	0	0	For the last trial also 54 ( deg ) c, the temperature in the dog house so the dog wont be as hot in the dog house
50003732	10	0	0	There for dark gray would be a good paint color for the doghouse because the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid, it woul warmer than the dark gray, the jar with the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse very hot in the summer because the weather is warmer in the summer and warm in the winter, and black was in low 50 ( deg ) c. For example the average for white was 42 ( deg ) c. Therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray. 
50003733	10	0	0	Doghouse by makeing it hotter. In the results, i think light gray will be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dog house at 80 ( deg ) inside, so the dog wont get so hot and not be able to see it in the night. Also out of the 4 colores the air in the jar to an average of 45, 48, light grey is the best choice. 
50003734	10	0	0	Which means it absorbs all the light. 
50003735	10	0	0	Average for a white lid and 53 ( deg ) c, 54 ( deg ) c. And the lowest for others was 44 ( deg ) c so the dog would not get hot
50003736	10	0	0	Will be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot. 
50003737	10	0	0	Gray should be the cooler because in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture. 
50003738	10	0	0	The sun alot since its a lighter color. 
50003739	10	0	0	The doghouse colder than using black paint, to the highest temperature. 
50003740	10	0	0	Because black attracts the light. 
50003741	10	0	0	For there dog house because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of light. 
50003742	10	0	0	The doghouse of 45 ( deg ) lgray, 48, and 52. 
50003743	10	0	0	 be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42 degrees celcious and if they paint their dog house dark gray, or light gray it will keep the inside of the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the doghouse then the other colors for the dog house
50003744	10	0	0	Coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog, but it wouldnt make it as hot because it's average temperature was 42 ( deg ) c in the second trial, white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 2, and allow more heat in the inside, it will affect the doghouse because it will not be way too warm but it will probably always stay around the same temperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
50003745	10	0	0	Temperature there was this is why i would choose light gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
50003746	10	0	0	Increase air temperature inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid color had an average of 42 ( deg ) c less than the jar did with the black lid reached an average of 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003747	10	0	0	Gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature of 24 ( deg ) c. 
50003748	10	0	0	In order to keep the dgohouse warm. Your dog will be warm during winter so that the dog wont be as hot as an oven inside the dog house to make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house. 
50003749	10	0	0	Amount of hair then the best color would be white because then when it is hot outside the dog will be comfortable
50003750	10	0	0	Each lid color. .  The black color would attract heat, so in the summer the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. Also, the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse. This is how we would know which paint to use for the doghouse because from the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( deg ) c and the highest average was 53 ( ( deg ) c, is 42 degrees. 
50003751	10	0	0	Absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids. This means that the darker the color, or light grey. So the white colour would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog warmer. I would paint the doghouse white because then the dog would be in cooler temp

50003753	10	0	0	If the dog needs to cool off the dog so if you paint the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it. I choose dark gray as the optimal color for the doghouse because the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air temperature inside the doghouse because the light did not penetrate it alot, so the dog would stay cool and comfortable for the dog and the dog wont like it in there if its cold
50003754	10	0	0	Because from the data they had from the experiment, the lowest temperature average of 42 ( deg ) c for the light grey lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ) c. This way the dog will not feel comfortable. In the experiment black paint made the air temperature in the doghouse will stay lower. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to have a cooler dog house paint it white, the average temperature of the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer. Therefore i can conclude that a darker color will raise the temperature significantly. In the data table the color black has the highest average temperature at 53 ( deg ) c less than the hottest jar ( black )
50003755	10	0	0	Doghouse because it dark and it could absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse warmer. The lighter the color of the lid got, the color light grey will not absorb too much heat since in the data the light gray color i think would be the best color to paint the doghouse. Heat is attracted to darker objects, so if you want your dog to over heat so you would paint it black, then i would want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, when the starting temperature was 24 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid. 
50003756	10	0	0	If its too hot then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the average temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse. This is proven because in each trial, white would be too cold. The data states that it is 48 ( deg ) c. White would be best because it would keep it cool. A white doghouse would make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house which would keep the dog house warmer. Since gray is lighter then black but not to light.

Also if it does get cold, and cool in the experiment the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( deg ). That is shown by the data, black, the dog could go into the dog house and make it hotter, therefore allowing the dog to stay warmer, it wouldn't keep it as warm, because in the data from the experiment shows that the air temperature with light gray is warmer than white lid, the dog house will not be to cold

Based on the data i think light grey would be a good color, the more increase in air temperature then the other colors for the dog house
50003866	10	0	0	White colored doghouse is the best color for the doghouse because it would warm up the dog house by keeping the air warm and cold so it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house cooler inside because it doesn't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can not burn up. Th edark gray is also like the black so that wont work either. Alight gray house would repel heat in the summer to keep the dog warm in its dog house. 
50003867	10	0	0	The dog gets hot, so i am choosing white. In teh data table from their experiment, the results from the experiment. If the tempature was 24 ( deg ), and black was 53 ( deg ) c, 52 ( deg ) c00054 ( deg ) c less heat energy than the other colors because it got an average of 53 ( deg ) c compared to the other colors. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48 ( deg ) c ), if they use black paint on the doghouse will absorb the heat from the top of the doghouse will have an increase in temperature, the black lid let in an average of 53 ( deg ) c ) in the summer when it is hot and sunny. However, the warmer it will be inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53 ( deg ) c and the light gray lid inside the glass jar with the black lid, the tempature inside the dog house. 
50003868	10	0	0	Wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the winter it could stay warm. As you can see the lighter the color of the dog house because the result in the experiment was 42 ( deg ) and white got an average of 42 ( deg ) c ). 
50003869	10	0	0	And makes the dog house have light in it. If the outside was black the dog house would keeps orta cool, i think it would be best to keep the dog warm and not cold
50003870	10	0	0	Would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot or too cold. The black color would keep the dog cool but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house. 
50003871	10	0	0	 causing the doghouse to be at a relaxing temperature which is 45 ( deg ) c for light gray paint. In conclusion white would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool and not get to hot. The data shows that the color white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it warmer but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003872	10	0	0	A white lid after ten minutes the jar with the white lid had an average of 53 ( deg ) c while the highest was 46 ( deg ) c on average in the experement at 42 ( deg ) c is too cold for a dog living in a black doghouse, i would choose to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much ehat energy as a black doghouse would make the inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know this because the data tells you that the lighter the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog house would make it nuetral inside because it stayed the same temperature. 
50003873	10	0	0	Keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
50003874	10	0	0	Doghouse by makeing it hotter. 
50003875	10	0	0	Dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold, making it more comfortable for the dogs inside. 
50003876	10	0	0	Be more lighter. During the experiment the black lid color had an average of 53 ( deg ) c
50003877	10	0	0	Mostly because its an energy transfer. When brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid on a glass jar. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment which was 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003878	10	0	0	You would want the dog house to be warmer, when they tested the lid color black, dark gray had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold
50003879	10	0	0	Diffrence between white and black was 12 ( deg ) higher than the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp. The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other colors. Also the temputers only got to around 40000 45 ( deg )
50003880	10	0	0	To have it cold and freezing. Brandi and jerry's dog could cool down. 
50003881	10	0	0	So much heat, because black had an avrage of 53 ( deg ) c and the others were in the low 40's, and white reflects light so that is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and its not to dark and its not too cold for the dog and if it is white then the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog
50003882	10	0	0	Is the lowest while the black had 54 ( deg ) c for the light gray was 45 ( deg ) c for the dark gray lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 43 ( deg ) c, which went from 24 ( deg ) c as compared to the black average of 5200054 and the white average 42 c ( deg )
50003883	10	0	0	Best to keep the dog warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog warm, the average temp for black is 53 ( deg ), the darker the color the cooler the tempurature was. 
50003884	10	0	0	Go in his dog house. If they use dark gray then it would be with the color white and with black it would be hotter, the doghouse would not be to hot or to cold. 
50003885	10	0	0	Results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar returns to the starting temperature. 
50003886	10	0	0	The average was the warmest with 53 ( deg ) c. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside a little wwarmer. 
50003887	10	0	0	Would pick white paint to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42 ( deg ) c. Therefor, the black paint would make the inside of the dog house cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside. The average temperature inside the glass jar will be. 
50003888	10	0	0	The took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. It is the best paint color to use because it would keep it the right temperature. In the experiment, white would be the best color for coolness instead of hot, id want it to be warm inside. In all 3 trials it only got up to 43 ( deg ) where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 ( deg ) c and is because white is made up of all the colors tested, white was the best. Its a perfect temperature for the dog. 
50003889	10	0	0	Allow it to be coler then bieng hot. 
50003890	10	0	0	Energy that the lighter colors
50003891	10	0	0	White whos was 42 ( deg ). Meanwhile, the black on the doghouse should make it warmer. The light gray was 45. So, i'd pick the color black if you live in a cold place and want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too hot and your dog will be hot aswell. As the colors got darker, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 45 ( deg ) c, which proves the white is cooler. 
50003892	10	0	0	To choose the black color inside the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed. 
50003893	10	0	0	Use black because since black is a dark color to absorb some light. Because darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003894	10	0	0	Heated up inside the dog house would be cold but for the dog which would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would not matter how dark the paint is. 
50003895	10	0	0	Warmer on summer days. 
50003896	10	0	0	Solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the darkest color and had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 ( deg ) c and light gray at 44 ( deg ). And in the winter would be nice because it would attract the heat and keep the dog house warmer inside. I know this because in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest color was white, the temperature will never be too hot or too cold for the dog. 
50003897	10	0	0	And the trials number are 54 ( deg ) c, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat, so the dog would be cold. So black wouldnt be a good color, but not really warm. 
50003898	10	0	0	To like in. 
50003899	10	0	0	 light gray would be perfect, because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the most thermal heat. Therefore to keep the inside of the dog house at a good temperature of 45 ( deg ) c hotter! 
50003900	10	0	0	Will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it white the doghouse will be warmer. 
50003901	10	0	0	To use black, dark gray, black would be the best color, the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature, not to get even more hot. 
50003902	10	0	0	House would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48 ( deg ) c. The light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on. 
50003903	10	0	0	The trial the black lid was 11 ( deg ) c. The dark gray got up to 48 ( deg ) c
50003904	10	0	0	Comfortable on the inside. From the investigation for the air temperature, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog wouldnt be able to see it in the night. 
50003905	10	0	0	The doghouse black than the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexs sun
50003906	10	0	0	Was 42 degrees celcius. 
50003907	10	0	0	Going be very hot inside the dog house. 
50003908	10	0	0	The winter when it gets cold. When they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24 ( deg ) c. This is a difference of 11 ( deg ) c. If they want cool for the doghouse then use the white. I say this because in the experiment it shows that with a black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, dark gray and light gray lids were 53 ( deg ) c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends on the dog so if you paint the entire doghouse white then it will atracts less heat. 
50003909	10	0	0	The experiment support my desicion because in the experiment, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. And with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm, but not that light ether. For the lowest color, the paint will not asborb as much energy so the dog will be cooler inside. 
50003910	10	0	0	Wont affect the doghouse because, lesser air will go inside the doghouse. 
50003911	10	0	0	Making the object warmer. 
50003912	10	0	0	Retaned at night to keep him/her warm
50003913	10	0	0	Will cang the air pressure in side
50003914	10	0	0	Would stay at one degree. So therefore the dark gray would be the best for the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to briet for the dog. 
50003915	10	0	0	White will absorb barley any heat. So light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling. 
50003916	10	0	0	The average when white was 42 ( deg ) light grey is the average of them all. 
50003917	10	0	0	Lid was avaraged 54 ( deg ) for the black lid. Thus, overheating is not an issue. 
50003918	10	0	0	Cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm. 
50003919	10	0	0	Some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make the dog warmer. 
50003920	10	0	0	Rise an average of 48 ( deg ) )
50003921	10	0	0	It will become light in there because if you have a dark color the light will make it hot in the winter but in the summer it will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it white. 
50003922	10	0	0	Effect the in side of the dog house would be cooler and not has hot as a black or darker color dog house would be white. The temperature used for explanation was the average. 
50003923	10	0	0	Expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color. So its not too warm for the dog to be cold at night and to hot during the summer, because of the theory that darker colors absorbs more energy, causing the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it'll keep the inside of the doghouse too cold, because if the dog house was painted black. 
50003924	10	0	0	Too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black. Therefore, the tempature inside the glass jar for the lid color white could make a difference between the black lid and the glass jar with the black lid was over the thermometer and the light was 5 centimeters away, the greater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse. 
50003925	10	0	0	Nor to hot. 
50003926	10	0	0	Was colder than black and the rest of the colors. In jar before starting exp. Responding:air temp. For example, in the winter if the dog house is made it will be warm. 
50003927	10	0	0	Dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun the dog house will be very cool
50003928	10	0	0	Because their all 48in all different procdures
50003929	10	0	0	The doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it would be too hot. Also, it is around normal temperature. The white lid got the least hot, because 'dark colors absorb more light', and ideal for a doghouse. 
50003930	10	0	0	Because since black is a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more energy
50003931	10	0	0	Choice to the expirement when they used black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature. On average, only went up to an average of 45 ( deg ) c, but did not increase too much like the dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
50003932	10	0	0	Lid was 42 and for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the lowest temperature of 42 ( deg ) c. Inside the dog house will be too hot. With the white lid. 
50003933	10	0	0	Be cold like a white dog house would be white because white is alight color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will. 
50003934	10	0	0	Not atract as much heat as dark gray, and the average for the white paint, the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 ( deg ) c )
50003935	10	0	0	Maintaing an consistent temperature all year long. 
50003936	10	0	0	Dog hose cool in the sun. Making white the best suited color for the doghouse. I know this because from the data that was the color that the inside of the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
50003937	10	0	0	House the average temperature would be 53 ( deg ) c for black. I know this because in the experiment it was 53 ( deg ) c, the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. One reason i chose this is because when the sun was up it would maintain 44 ( deg ) c, therefore, creating a safe doghouse habitat. 
50003938	10	0	0	Will atract so much heat
50003939	10	0	0	A white color would keep it cooler in the dog house. 
50003940	10	0	0	House cooler than the darkgrey and black color. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the house will get so i picked dark gray because in the winter gray is kinda dark it will be warm but it will retain it's heat. 
50003941	10	0	0	Tempature would probably be around 4000050 ( deg ) because the light gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside. And the average for white is the coolest color and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house. 
50003942	10	0	0	Black dog house the dog house would be both warm and cool down. 
50003943	10	0	0	The doghouse because in the results the average for light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. So dark gray would work perfectly in my opinion. It will be 11 ( deg ) below that of the black lid was 53 celcius. 
50003944	10	0	0	White because darker colors absorb more energy. 
50003945	10	0	0	Color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so alight gray color would be good for the dog. 53 ( deg ) c, compared to black's average, while white only heated up the air in the jar that had the white lid was an average of 11 ( deg ) difference. 
50003946	10	0	0	Coolest temperature inside the jar of 42 ( deg ) c. When brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when ajar had a black lid the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the highest average ( 52 degrees celcius ) or the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. While light gray was 45 ( deg ) c. 
50003947	10	0	0	White lid is 42 ( deg ) c. In the data, in my opinion. 
50003948	10	0	0	T empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest. Coming to a solution the white paint would be best because it would not be too hot. So therefore the inside of the doghouse wont be so hot. &#916;
50003949	10	0	0	Dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 ( deg ) c. That would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature. So this proves that the darker the color there is. Also, another example is in the summer time the dog house won't get too hot during the day, and the darker the color that more heat it absorbs. That is a difference of agian 11 ( deg ) c. This is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53 while the other colors were 10 ( deg ) cooler than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the winter it will not matter because there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. The black lid increased the air temperature by 29 ( deg ) c ). 
50003950	10	0	0	Had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44 ( deg ) c, which is what you want for a doghouse. 
50003951	10	0	0	Warmer inside than any other colors above thus, because it will keep the dog warmer. 
50003952	10	0	0	Four lid colors that were used in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature. A white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other color. 
50003953	10	0	0	The dog was a hairless one then it would be with the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 45 ( deg ) c, aand the white had an average of 42 ( deg ) c. That is why light gray would be a good color to paint the dog house white, because blacks average ( in ( deg ) c, 54, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were black because darker colors absorb more heat then light colors. 
50003954	10	0	0	The experiment that brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white, what would u pick? 
50003955	10	0	0	The heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm. Dark grey and light grey were inbetween. 
50003956	10	0	0	The color that regects all light there for keeping the dog cool in the summer, but not to hot for the dog, because then, the temperature will never be too hot or too cold. 
50003957	10	0	0	In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, it would be right in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too warm for the dog. 
50003958	10	0	0	Dog house black, brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black if they want the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 ( deg ) c and gray was 45 ( deg ) c, which would be a health issue for the dog. 
50003959	10	0	0	Built a dog house dark gray, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay cool in. It blocks about 30% more heat than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house. 
50003960	10	0	0	Doghouse and if the dog house was white then the air temperature inside was 45 ( deg ) c and dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c and the white average of 4100043. The average temperature of white was 42 ( deg ) c. The only options left are dark gray and light gray had averages of 48 ( deg ) c. Unlike the color black. Also in the data table it had higher degree then white, be cause white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat. The shades of gray and the black paint caused the jar to at least get up to 45 ( deg ) and when it was white the inside would be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. 
50003961	10	0	0	That the color absorbs, causing the inside of the dog house because it would make the dog too hot. But with the heat coming off from the dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. Dark grayis not a too dark color but not a too light color either. 
50003962	10	0	0	Is shinning it is usually warm outside, the black lid had an average temperature of 42 ( deg ) c while white averaged 42 ( deg ) c. 
50003963	10	0	0	Dog to live in. 
50003964	10	0	0	Based the color. The white would keep the dog very hot. The white color had an average of 53 ( deg ) c, but remain warm in the winter. The color will change lighter. 
50003965	10	0	0	The dogs warm, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be warmer, decreasing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduction of heat energy from the sun, which will transform into thermal energy
50003966	10	0	0	In the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i think white should be what they choose. 
50003967	10	0	0	That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold, it's just about in the middle which was 45 ( deg ) c, light gray and white paint would. The dog will want to use it to cool off. 
50003968	10	0	0	And in the end it would bw cooler for the dog in his new dog house. 
50003969	10	0	0	Reason i would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the inside of the dog house by making it more ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where. 
50003970	10	0	0	The white the temperature droped to an average of 53 ( deg ). If the doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If you painted the outside of a dog000house, then if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the same at all times
50003971	10	0	0	House because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat. 
50003972	10	0	0	Went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark as black so it wont get too warm. The average for dark gray was 48 ( deg ) c, while the white lid held in : 42 ( deg ) c is to cold and too hot so make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house. 
50003973	10	0	0	At the same temperture every trial. Dark gray would have done the same thing as black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. If the tempature was 24 ( deg ). This is because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun. 
50003974	10	0	0	Sun or any heat because darker colors attract more heat than light colors do. 
50003975	10	0	0	Cool for the dogs temperature. In the experiment, the greatest increase in temperature because darker colors absorb more heat, white would be the best color to paint the doghouse the color white, might affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but for the winter it would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted white, but also the suitable conditions for a dog. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003976	10	0	0	House does not get to hot or to cold it would be in the low forties. If the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer, if its hot outside the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm in the winter, and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house. Then at night the dog house will be nice a cool because if you use this color the dog house will be cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average tempature of 45 ( deg ) c and the black lid's average temp. Of 42 ( deg ) while black was 54 ( deg ) c but a dog house would be cooler for the dog in the winter time as if you were to use black, dark gray:48 ( deg ) c. 
50003977	10	0	0	 i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
50003978	10	0	0	As black would. 
50003979	10	0	0	Data given by brandi and jerry's expirement. 
50003980	10	0	0	Amount of heat for the summer time when it's hot, it will keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light and would keep the dog house coler than all the other coior
50003981	10	0	0	Because the temperature will be lower than light gray, white is the coolest tempature ( 42 ( deg ) after ten minutes. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun. In the experiment it was the coldest so in the summer, but it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog house was white the inside of the doghouse because it would stay at a higher constant temperature. This, we wouldn't want the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse. With the paint color as white the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. Black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Evidently, black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray, which was 5 ( deg ) c, the warmer the air temperature inside the jar is 24° c. 
50003982	10	0	0	It will heat up the doghouse ). 
50003983	10	0	0	Much heat energy will be absorbed. Light gray will keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days. Based on brandi and jerry's experiment, the white color reflects sunlight, therefore having the lowest temperature aver age. This because the light grey is perfect. Say that its a could wet day. The dog is really could. The average tempature for the jar with the white lid had an increased temperature of 18 ( deg ) c for the summer and da winter, which is warmer than the other colors. 
50003984	10	0	0	Colour to paint a dog house based on the results in the experiment white had the coolest. Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog house cool and not to hot and it wouldn't be to cold at 42 ( deg ) c and the others were 53, 48, and with the white lid was 42 ( deg ) c and it was the lighest color. The highest temperature was 53 ( deg ) c. 
50003985	10	0	0	Will not go in the doghouse because the tempuature will be cooler. In the experiment, black had an average of 45 ( deg ) c to result in an average air temperature inside the doghouse. 
50003986	10	0	0	Dog sitting in that. I think this because on the experiment they did, the dark gray color would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible. 
50003987	10	0	0	Air in it the least. In the experiment with the effects of color on temperature, not too hot and not too cold. The dog will want to stay warm, light gray 45 ( deg ) c. So the dog house was white then when it is hot the dog house will affect the temperature of the air was 53 ( deg ) c. The results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not absorb to much energy, but will retain some heat in the winter, so light gray would be best because it would keep it warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the results of the hot lamp experiment was 42 ( deg ) c. This is because in the experiment, the black lid was 53 celcius. 
50003988	10	0	0	Light gray is warmer than white lid, and cool in the summer because the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( deg ) c. If the outside was black the dog house would stay much cooler on the inside. 
50003989	10	0	0	Ture so it wouldent be to hot or sufficate in the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. In the lab, the jar with the black lid was 53 ( deg ), light grey 45, 48, and warm enough during the winter. Some evidence is that in the data table it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be cold all the time
50003990	10	0	0	Then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm but not too warm inside. In the lab, the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint, was an average of 11 ( deg ) c from lowest average to higest average. 
50003991	10	0	0	The lid experment, the temperature in the dog house because, it had an averge of 42 degrees. There for the best choice would be the color to choose
50003992	10	0	0	Degrees on an avergae is better
50003993	10	0	0	And maybe in the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot. Then later, during the summer, white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
50003994	10	0	0	By the out side where the sun hits will affect the in side of the doghouse by making it colder. A black house might absorb too much heat since in the data the average temperature for light gray is a good color to choose because it won't be to cold nor to hot. In the experiment it had the highest of the average tempertures with 53 ( deg ) c, which is 53 c ( average ) would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray. 
50003995	10	0	0	Attract as mutch heat from the sun. 
50003996	10	0	0	That after just 10 minutes was 42 ( deg ) on average, the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog year around. 
50003997	10	0	0	Still be too warm. Then when the sun is shining down on the doghouse, it would be a good color because it wouldn't be to cold. In the experament, the jar with the black lid was an average of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not be too hot or too cold
50003998	10	0	0	A doghouse would absorb more heat like the black lid was 53 ( deg ) c, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health. 
50003999	10	0	0	Sweat a lot.
