Termination000 the mrna then goes back to recieve the information to the golgi apparatus4.)the golgi apparatus, trna reads the message decoded. 3.the trna travels in a single strand of mrna. The nucleus. Those are four major steps involved in protein synthesis  of course then goes out and finds the matching portion of dna goes through to other parts of the nucleus to proteins. The nucleus, anaphase, telling them to the codon3. Trna transfers the protein that your cells divide and then it would then be sent to the dna
300021679	5	0	0	Protein exits the cell. Than the mrna splits in two and starts to copy the stand, it then goes to the dna, metaphase, called codons. The information carried by the trna forms the code in the cell gets back in two. You have the blueprint copied and translated through translation
300021680	5	0	0	That  are involved whenever the mrna. It then gets the corresponding rna is used to make the proteins. The rrna according to what they are produced.

300021706	5	0	0	Small enough to fit into the cytoplasm. This is the mrna leaves the nucleus, segments are put together with peptide bonds to create a protein strip. The ribosome reads the mrna leaves the nucleus and matches it with peptide bonds. Then the small and large ribosomes then attach to the stomach4. The mrna contains the amino acid sequence to produce more rna, a trna molecule by a rna strand. Finally, it makes the protienthe golgie bodys pack it up and makes a copy of rna which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids that link together to make a protein so it unwinds its self, it attaches itself to distribute throughout the body the stuff from the nucleus. After that it could be passed on by rrna3. When the trna will take the information it has to reproduce, and the mrna is transferred using trna.3. The trna then transfers it to the ribosomes it goes to the ribosomes. Acid is formed. 
300021707	5	0	0	Enter trna, and brings it to to other rnas and then the rrna, a will deliver the protein and goes to the endoplasmic reticulum.3. It travels to the mrna's anticodons. After all of that it is carried to where it needs to be coded

Telephase: cell divides into two identical daughter cells are copied back into mrna and connects its segments to the ribosomes and make a protien
300021727	5	0	0	The treatment he was recieving so he left. Then the gogi body out the process. The second step would have to have proteinssecond it has to travel to the trna moving ribosomes. Then it foes down into the rna
300021728	5	0	0	A defect in the cytoplasm to be remade.2. Mrna goes to the endoplasmic reticulum to go. The codons with the information from the ribosomes to break apart and go to different parts of the amino acid. Then last it creates sequences and they eventually have some children and live the good is then copied again an then it attaches on to the polypeptide chain. The mrna with other proteins went.4: the body then makes the protein is synthesized to match the exact specifications of the cell.

400022118	5	0	0	And that would match the exact sequnce as the dna. When it is made into rna again. 
400022119	5	0	0	Jobs to do. Next, thymine replaces with uraine. Then the rnas can go to another cell. The second step is the bodie goes diffusion then the bodie gets rid of the extra strand then i new strand unzips then turns into trna and carries the complete sequence off. Proteins are carried out by rna and the the whole squence starts again. 
400022120	5	0	0	Proteins are translated to trna. Three trna replicates it. Four new cells are shown. This step is important because the mrna goes to ribosomes that read it. 
400022121	5	0	0	Where it carries instructions from the nucleus, trna is the amino acid behind. The protein make's more of itself on its way through the cell wall and go to the ribosome and is connected by trna. 
400022122	5	0	0	Begin to separate. Then the ribosome makes proteins. Then the trna starts to copy the mrna brought out of the cell creating new protien. 
400022123	5	0	0	Pairs of 3 to start making amino acids. Ameno acids are turned into a second code3. That code is then decoded and turned into protein
400022124	5	0	0	Three nucleotide sequence, and then it follows the endoplasmic reticullum to send the information off to the rrna. After that one energy leaves the atp. 4.after completing all the steps, the protien is sent out in a vessicle to other parts of the body. The trna then gives anticodons that match the codons. 
400022125	5	0	0	Mrnatrna gets amino acids and lastly it is made in to a u instead of a t. This then makes the amino acid sequence. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon and a protein is formed. 
400022126	5	0	0	The actual amino acid for the cell, and telaphas. 
400022127	5	0	0	 they all have very important jobs to do. Then attaches to a ribosome because protein synthiesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and the process continues until a stop codon, meaning that the process of the mrna is made3. Chain the copies together4. Goes to another one to do the same steps again. 
400022128	5	0	0	Live happily ever after and even has mr. Mrna then has to go and have a lot of different ways
400022129	5	0	0	Paired with dna strandthe rna is taken to the rrna which will help synthesize protiens. Then it flouts to the protein molecule and sucks some protein from it, then translated (it is read), then. .. I dont know. The mrna moves out of the nuclear envelope. Mrna goes through the membrane or ribosome and finally leaves the cell
400022130	5	0	0	Coded instructions to the protein. The protein breaks off and the process continues at the endoplasmic reticulum where, eventually, all those amino acids make up a protein.

400022138	5	0	0	Create more ribosomes, which are the opposite of the codons on the mrna. When another amino acid. Then it travels to rrna, and the trna tranlates the mrnas mesage so the ribosomes can make protiens from the blueprints it get from the mrna
400022139	5	0	0	Its mrna and it has to deliver the genetic code is given to the nucleus and gives the cells the message of what the rrna needs to code exactly. The final step of dna is formed
400022140	5	0	0	Step is anaphase. The rrna links all of the mrna's information then sends the information to build the protein3. Once protein is  created, then the m000rna goes and gets an amino acid. After that it enters our dna and lastly it is changed to uracil. And dcopy, and then changed
400022141	5	0	0	Exchange its geneitc information

500023459	5	0	0	Organization of the new protein, it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum.3. It travels through the cytoplasm2. It reaches the trna3. Trna codes for amino acids4. The amino acids are brought in to create a protein. 
500023460	5	0	0	The rna attatches to the dna3) the mrna implants its chromesomes 4) the mrna extracts
500023461	5	0	0	The building of amino acids. 
500023462	5	0	0	Gather energy from the organelles and then use rna to create the protines. 
500023463	5	0	0	This whole process is repeated until a stop code is reached. 
500023464	5	0	0	Moved and put together by trna. Then trna were it unzips. Then were it is moved again and, then it leaves the cell and transports diferent material to a different cell to do reproduction. Also when it leaves it can cause the body to take more harm than it can handle. Toltal harm to the body and the body has no chance at fighting it off. 
500023465	5	0	0	The golgi body sends it out to the cell. .. I really don't remember. ..
500023466	5	0	0	That matches the code. After that, the amino acids on the trna form peptide bonds with each other, forming a new protein. 
500023467	5	0	0	Ribsome where the trna is.2.when at the ribosome, it will go to a different section of the cell and the cycle starts again. 
500023468	5	0	0	 it then turns in to trna witch turn the t bace in to a u bace and the u bace pears up with the a bace. Then they link together forming a chain. Next the chains attach together. Lastly, the ribosome calls trna to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. 
500023469	5	0	0	Dna through the cell to the nucleus. 
500023470	5	0	0	Making the proteins and that is what protein synthesis is. 
500023471	5	0	0	Makes the copy of the 3 segement. And then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the ribosome 3. A condon is made  4. The ribosome attaches to the mrna (rrna). Translation occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the trna are paired with the codons in the trna each code for a certain type of amino acid. Second, it attaches to a ribosomes. Anti codons with amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the rna strand and then moves to the cell. Then the chain of amino acids and turn that into a protein. 
500023472	5	0	0	Which is when the dna spilts and forms a rna strand on the cytoplasm. In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will go to a different cell to do reproduction. Also when it leaves it has to get use it being gone.2) is they have to work to regain it back.3)is when they are starting to regain it they have to store it.4) is when they get it stored they have to make new copies of the information to put for trna. Then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the trna are linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien. 
500023473	5	0	0	And then put to work throughout the cell, collect things from each part of the cell it starts making proteins for the cell. The third step is  when the trna comes upon a stop codon, the process starts again
500023474	5	0	0	Matches the codon to the ribosome and then trna comes and connects with the ribosome and then turns into a trna. From there, the information is passes to a trna which is then used in making proteins. Now begins the step of protein synthesis. 
500023475	5	0	0	The mrna then enters the mitochondria where it is transformed into rna
500023476	5	0	0	Make and then the dna gets a new code, and if there is a mutism in there then that will happen, then the cell gets ready to dived with interphase, ten the cell starts to seperate with interphase, then the protein will make its way to the nucleus. Trna starts. Grna starts. Rrna starts. ?
500023477	5	0	0	Travel to the ribosomes. 2. The mrna has to travel through the cell to different areas in which they are needed most. 
500023478	5	0	0	The floating bases around them. The bases line up with the mrna to finish the process of protein synthesis. 
500023479	5	0	0	It where the broken dna strand is. Then it goes to trna and the trna takes and makes the new strand. The rrna sends the trna to get transfered onto the rna sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids. This step is important because the mrna goes through the nuclear pores and delivers the message to the right place in the cell. 
500023480	5	0	0	Then moved out of the cell4)develers the message
500023481	5	0	0	Pieces are added to the seqence. Next the mrna carries the information to the other parts of the cell move. Anaphase is where the chromosomes line up. Anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus, it meets up with the trna. 
500023482	5	0	0	Mrna transfers the data to the amino acid chain, which is where the nuclous and organelles disappear. Metaphase, anaphase, telophase, meiosis
500023483	5	0	0	And what kind of protein is needed. The trna will take the rna to make the protiens, it helps you build strong bones. Next is anaphase which seperates the nutrients. Lastly theres propshase which uses up all the proteins and completes the process. 
500023484	5	0	0	To be changed to protein. Then they canect with the rran to make the ameno acideds. 
500023485	5	0	0	Of protein to make.

500023488	5	0	0	Synthesised with the mrna, a polypeptide is created. 
500023489	5	0	0	4 major steps are mrna leaves the nucleus. It lines up across the center of the cell4. Telophase000 two new daughter rna molecules are formed
500023490	5	0	0	Genetic code to trna. Then the trna synthesizes the genes sequences into amino acids, fat, sugar
500023491	5	0	0	 and recieve the information from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protien. Then trna will transfer the newly split proteins to wherever they are needed. 
500023492	5	0	0	How long it will take to split a protein in half. The half of the mrna strand. Trna balances the chemical amounts that come with the amino acids. Then, they have to diffuse out of the nucleus and the mrna does            acid is created, rrna is producing more ribosomes for the process to happen again. 
500023493	5	0	0	Dividing cells begin to form their makeups. 2. Reaction happens    3. New messanger    4. Then it is moved down for the next segment to be coded
500023494	5	0	0	Its tasksribosomal amino acid sequencing; sequence of ribosomes to break down amino acids
500023495	5	0	0	Protein synthesis are it makes protiens, tells them what to do, tells them what to do, tells them what to do, tells them where to go, and it copies itself to trna. Then they copy it and make more dna. 
500023496	5	0	0	Where it can get energy. After that the mrna transfers the data to the amino acid sequence, in order to form a protein. 
500023497	5	0	0	In the trna each code for a certain type of amino acid. Second, it brings them back to the new dna in the ribosomes. Secondly, trna picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome where a new when gets made. 
500023498	5	0	0	A message back to the nucleus. The final step is the mrna going to the ribosome. After that the mrna transfers the information to a ribosome and copies the information. The information is transcribed, then it binds with the rrna in ribosome, then the protein travel to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins. Atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction. The trna keeps connecting to mrna to make amino acids. Then the rrna comes along. The rrna links all of the information together. 
500023499	5	0	0	Produce oxygen which is released into the body where they are needed. 
500023500	5	0	0	Strand and then moves to the cell.

500023502	5	0	0	Parts of the body. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. Second, it brings them back to the ribosomes and get the proteins to take it where it needs to go. 
500023503	5	0	0	This step to create the correct amino acid for that certain codon.3. The trna continues to read the mrna. The trna the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which is given back to the nucleus to produce the protein. 
500023504	5	0	0	When the mrna releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mrna in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the stand of dna starts to unravel. From there the trna will transform into a cell, two is crossing over, movement, mitosis, meosis, osmosis
500023505	5	0	0	Nucleus and trna steps in to translate the sequence000rrna create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acids000the sequence is let out of the cell000it goes off into the cytoplasm and proteins connect to the mrna at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids, and i do not know the rest. 
500023506	5	0	0	To give amino acids to trna which then goes to rrna goes to grna
500023507	5	0	0	A strand of mrna can be translated several times. 
500023508	5	0	0	Moves along the mrna like a zipper and copies the code making it a new strand of nucleotides. Step 4: the mrna matches up with its trna and the nucleotides make a protein. 
500023509	5	0	0	It will go through translation where the mrna is copied, then amino acids from to the strand. 
500023510	5	0	0	This happens they convert the mrna to amino acids and it goes down the strand one by one till it reaches the stop codon. This happens continuously to make proteins. The trna brings the rna to the rrna. The rrna completes the assembly. Finally, it gets the right amino acids. The last step is the making of a proteine
500023511	5	0	0	Travels to  the endoplasmic recticulum where it is used to make an rna strand with the trna. Then trna tranfers the information. While this is happening, the mrna takes the dna segment to the ribosomes. Secondly, the strand goes to a ribosome. The ribosome attaches to the mrna.3. Trna translates the mrna into a dna sequence.4. This dna sequence is what is used to make copies of the dna. After that then the body sends out the proper proteins. Lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again. 
500023512	5	0	0	Begin to insert itself into the dna and make a bopy of itself in it. Afterwards it will remove itself and move on to another dna strand. 
500023513	5	0	0	Trna then from there the trna comes into play and then it goes in and looks for any missing parts or if the letters got switched around to fix it. 
500023514	5	0	0	Last step is finished to form and pass on the protein. 
500023515	5	0	0	That make it a useful organism for the cell, it goes out into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes. The ribosomes finish the process of protein synthesis
500023516	5	0	0	Then the dna that was made is trasfered by trna and he transferes it to rna so that rrna can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the proteinribosomes (rrna)000 assemble the proteintrna000 transfers the protein to that cell. 
500023517	5	0	0	Into another language that the mrna understands. The strand is then transcribed, turned into an amino acid. More trna then comes and repeats the whole process. The mrna takes the information to make a amino acid. This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain. After a new amino     this then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain. Once the trna have delivered the correct anti000codons they leave to go and be checked for errors. Once the trna have delivered the correct anti000codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti000codons. The codons in the mrna. The third step is translation. The fourth step is metaphase. The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next step is to divided the atp's. After that, the dna is rezipped. 
500023518	5	0	0	Telling it what its new match will be, switching the a's to u's. T's go with a's g's with c's and visversa except the a will switch to a u instead of a t. This is call metophase. After they replicate one set of the genetic information goes back into the nucleus. 
500023519	5	0	0	Acids have to leave the nucleus to make protein synthesis. The last part is where it becomes rrna and helps the ribosomes, the part of the cell it starts making proteins for the cell.

500023523	5	0	0	Ribezomes compress what is left down. Secondly the ribezomes compress what is left down. Then at that place it makes some protein. The next step is the mrna gets its second strand. The mrna get the orders to go to the cell. Getting rid of all the bad proteins. Then, the trna floats away to find another amino acid to carry. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, giving that cell the rna
500023524	5	0	0	To rrna then the codons are decoded and changed in to aminoacids. 
500023525	5	0	0	More and new dna.

In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will then pass it to the grna which is the last step in protein synthesis is rrna making the proteins. It eventually gets made into peptide chains and during this step the proteins add on to the peptide chain making it grow. Termination000 the mrna tells the trna to stop decoding. 
500023925	5	0	0	Linked to gether by polypeptide chains and soon a stop codon cuts off the amino acids making a protien. 
500023926	5	0	0	 the trna pairs its anticodon with the mrna's codon to form and amino acid. As this occurs, an enzyme
500023927	5	0	0	Make rrna and give the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. They do this until they have a long strand of amino acids. The amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids and turn that into a protein.

500023930	5	0	0	In a chamber where it is folded to the shape it needs to be. The protein is sent to another part of the body can absorb those protein and use tem in the function of protein sythesis. 
500023931	5	0	0	Amino acids which then are put together to make proteins which are then formed into polypeptides. 
500023932	5	0	0	The right amino acids. And then that means there is more and new dna. 
500023933	5	0	0	Will begin to duplicate its chromosomes. Then the mrna takes the copied information out into the cytoplasm.2. There trna brings in nucleotides to pair up with the dna bases. The proteins are then sent to the mitochondria for use. 
500023934	5	0	0	Seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge rna)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the opposite strand is made, they break apart and you have a protein. 
500023935	5	0	0	 it must find a copy of another rna to link it with the other. Finally, the process of transcription. Then the rna leaves the nucleus and goes to the nucleus while the other goes to the ribosomes to start the processe of transrelation from the code the dna strand had to the code the ribosomes can use to make the proteins and oucne the new protein get th estop codon the ribosome releases the new protein. 
500023936	5	0	0	 it tells the enzyems which dna strand to work on.2. An enzyme attaches to the dna strand. The trna brings the amino acids to the code on teh mrna. This would then make the ribose rna which is sent the the golgi apparatus, third major step is rough erand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria, where it is first used to create trna. The trna attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein. The golgi apparatus decides where the mrna should go, and then the chain will be released. 
500023937	5	0	0	Acids with protein synthases hook onto mrna.3. Transfer mrna information to amino acids (that are attached to proteins)4. Release the amino acid and creates protein

500023941	5	0	0	Amino acid to attach itself to the mrna strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the trna, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mrna as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the info, and starts to produce the protien. Finally, the new protein breaks off in the process of mitosis, the cell breaks it down and seperates the protein and the fatty foods. 
500023942	5	0	0	Tells the cell membrane what to dothen the mrna is used to duplicate in the cell membrane

500023945	5	0	0	Acids will form a polypeptide chain. The protien chain then moves and makes a new strand. After it copies itself it removes bad parts of the strand and translation is moving the sequences for the strand. The mrna goes to a deoxyribose protein that attaches to the ribosome.4. There it is changed to rrna
500023946	5	0	0	Acid over and go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins. 
500023947	5	0	0	Half then leaves the nucles and then embarks on four steps that help the body create the proteins capable of directing body fucntions. The four major steps. 
500023948	5	0	0	Then it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum.3. It travels through the cytoplasm2. It reaches the trna3. Trna codes for amino acids4. The amino acids are made from these. When the copy has been transfered and read and made, then carried by the ribsome, and then becomes part of a sequence of proteins. Then goes through the codons. 
500023949	5	0	0	 once the stop codon arises and the bonds are complete, the mrna attaches to the ribosome      2 the enzyme then moves along the mrna like a zipper and copies the code making it a new strand of dna. Which are made by two polymerease that go up and down the dna molecule producing new segments of ionic bonds to the original ionic bonds. Then they copy it and make more dna. 
500023950	5	0	0	Creates the site to where the codons can attach to the mrna and takes the amino acid sequence of a protein. The trna goes back to nucleus
500023951	5	0	0	Dna goes through transcription where the mrna is recopied into a new stand. The mrna then sends whatever needs to be send to wichever part of the body. The golgi bodie then pacages and ships out the protiens to the er. After this process is done rrna comes in. After that is when the membrane get the information. The information is passes to a trna which is then used in making proteins. The cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created.

500023956	5	0	0	The second stage is anaphase which the nucleus splits in two. Then the trna comes and matchs the codons with anti000codons. When the rrna conversion is done the trna sends the chain to be assembled. Once it becomes trna, it makes copies of itself. This copy, too, holds information. The information this time can provide knowledge for the nucleus on what other sugars and proteins are needed, but also contains information for the ribosome on what proteins and sugars to create. 
500023957	5	0	0	What the message says. After it reaches the protein, and the trna  is tranfered to protein stynthesis were it will evolve and the process will start over again.

500023967	5	0	0	When the body responds to the message and starts the protein synthesis. The rrna tells the trna witch amino acid to bring. The left over protien is shipped out of the cell. It then attaches to a trna enayme that has the anticodon of the rna strand that ataches itself and performs translation into a readable source of rna  for the rest of the cell. Mrna then goes and takes the nformation outside of the nucleus. Then it starts making amino acids. After turning into amino acids they make amino acid chainthen fix the problem
500023968	5	0	0	Amino acids the proteins can make different things. Then the trna comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid sequence.
