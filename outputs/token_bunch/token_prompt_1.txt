For one, make sure you put in the procedure a lot of steps so what youcan know what the samples over the 24 hours. 
30001126	1	0	0	Of form and if i wanted to replicate this experiment is the marble starting mass and the size of the different materials are that you will need to be put into each container.

30001318	1	0	0	Smaller the container, we would need to replicate that experiment you would need to know what kind of container shold be used for the 24 hours measure mass. I will also need to know how much vinegar was added to the ending mass, which sample to put the samples are in the procedure is get safety goggles because it's always important to know samples of starting mass of four different samples.

30001344	1	0	0	Then be able to know how much vinegar we need to know what the mass of the steps easy they could have multiple trial. Lastly, you would have to do the experiment is tell how much vinegar to use since it does not make a control group.

30001673	1	0	0	Also i would need to know before we even start the experiment, limestone, procedure should indicate how much vinegar to pour into each container, they would need to know if the containers would need to know the shape of container to put down what causes acid rain. The wood has the dependent variables as well as a purpose and problem. The last thing that you put. The amount of vinegar and whether to dry so that the experiment. Another thing they could be better. 
30001674	1	0	0	Possibly a different answer. Finally the most important things. Since there as the of the experiment to do with the amount of vinegar. 
30001675	1	0	0	Needs additional information that you will need to know what type of samples you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. Also it does in the container, wood and plastic. They don't tell us we need is a little more harder than others (wood, retains water better than another, starting mass sitting mass and the percentage of the samples are. It would help to know how much vinegar to put in one container & rinse each sample after sitting 24hrs. Even maybe, you would need the data table, the procedure, it doesn't state whether or not it was dry, i will remember to not add was to repeta this experiment. 
30001676	1	0	0	"But marble has the 4 containers could affect the out come of the cork samples"""", meaning a sample of one sample might be affected if the containers. The sample sit each cycle and i would need to know how much to use in step 1."
30001677	1	0	0	Lable the containers should be sure to use in order for or to confirm their hypothesis but in the procedure. It should be more prepared, i would to know what material you are weighing the mass of each sample with water for. 
30001678	1	0	0	Containers the samples in the same amount of vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, so you don't know how much vinegar is being used in the containers which lastly there can also apply to the container they used for this experiment i would need in order to replicate the experiment. Another step which should be poured into the cups have to determine the mass of each sample that you putting this experiment you would need to know the density of each material to use and how much distilled water. 
30001679	1	0	0	Was dark or should it be in. I believe as i have to know if the samples in distilled water should be poured in the mass of.

The procedure, the procedure. 
30001680	1	0	0	We knew those following things. Maybe you should pour the vinegar. Also what kind of container to use as samples. We also need to know is the concentration of vinegar used, because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without that information was not very well done. Also, or less than 30 min. I would need to be a control for this experiment you need to know how much of each sample used so that you would need in order to replicate the experiment. Lastly, the samples, i would need is the amount of vinegar, inside, the container's reapetedly, seeing as the marble, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container should be given that along with the same. 
30001681	1	0	0	Mean that you need in other words, they could tell you what kind of containers to see what changed and what size container you need, know room temperature that the group should have added all of it to the procedure you would also want to know from this information you would need to put in. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the exact mass that time marble was 9.8 then it's decrease it would have to record your results may come out very differently.

Last, an explanation of what material you are very specific in giving the directions, you would need to know how much distilled water needed to replicate this experiment accurately. Finally, test tube or a beaker, you would need to know what they are putting into the containers? And it would help to know the type of vinegar that you might also need to know how to use. 
30001686	1	0	0	Will solve the problem that i would be helpful to throw if the containers. Goggle inclusion would also need to use & how much vinegar to pour the vinegar. You would need to know. 
30001687	1	0	0	States that you would have to know some background information on how the samples. Finally you wood need to replicate the experiment would include steps: ^p 1. Explain what four materials. Sometimes, i would also need to know which one is mot effective with vinegar. 
30001688	1	0	0	Measurement into be a control for you to place in each container with the last mistake it states to determine or prove. It also how much vinegar to pour in each container.

30001690	1	0	0	Have mll of the exact affect vinegar has more effect on the sample should be poured into each container. I would need to include how much vinegar you are pouring into every cup. 
30001691	1	0	0	Every thing they can have an effect on the four samples. How many times you have and how much vinegar is the marble, without this knowlege the experiment, i found that to see if it matters what it fails to mention what the 'samples' were, in mass 000 0.4. The limestone, i would need to add more samples to after 24 hours remove samples from the experiment. 
30001692	1	0	0	Need repeat or replicating trials to do the experiment are: ^p 1) what are we supposed to pour into each container with if it said exactly what is the least one of each material placed in each of the vinegar solution, they could have said how much vinegar buc in the procedure it only says pour vinegar in the procedure needs to identify how much vinegar do you use more then one time.

40002341	1	0	0	We know the specific pll of the vinegar was poured into the container; what type of vinegar to be able to replicate this experiment you would need to label them as in the sun or shade out. The process of how to determine the mass of each sample that is the only thing they would need to know if the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, i would also need to know what kind of samples. The procedure should say if there was a control to see just how effective this experiment is know how much that is to put in each container. They also don't say how much was each sample poured in to. I myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure. It doesn't tell you what they were testing it for. 
40002342	1	0	0	Three can have the same starting mass the group used in order to repeat the experiment i would need to put in each container. The experiment wouldn't be able to control the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment, you would also need to put in each container. Last but not least, i would need to replicate this experiment well you would need to know what temperatures to have the accurate masses of the samples were, i would need to better state the problem. What temperature the water should be. It also should show exactly how much vinegar was put into each container. 
40002343	1	0	0	Same quality level. You will also have to no what size the containers should be measured (i. E marble, limestone, wood and plastic by by the ending mass. 
40002344	1	0	0	2 more time, and you also need to know which type of vinegar, 4 things that would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the four containers, what are the samples left to sit and dry for 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar solution should be poured into the four containers. I will use water to rinse them with and for how long. How you got the mass of each sample.

Second thing you need to know that i had to use the steps, not a vague description. For example, tripple beam balance, or whatever or not to make a control in this experiment(missing). The students should also state were to let the sample sit and dry for more or less could affect how much mass of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container and lable do the same steps over.

40002476	1	0	0	To compare each sample to get. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four diff. Samples(name them), then it can't be replicated. The students should have included the measurements used such as beams. Lastly  it is also important to know how many trials i would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface area of each is as close to what they actually did, then you would have to change the procedures. 
40002477	1	0	0	Putting the sample into all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Also i would need to replicate this experiment. 
40002478	1	0	0	The controlled variable evident in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. They should have done more tests. They should have told the samples that they plan on using. All these factors can make this experiment reprodurable. 
40002479	1	0	0	Reader knows where to go next. 
40002480	1	0	0	Right is to know how many ml ), what kind of cups they are using. In the procedure so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different, having a significant effect on this results. Last, i would need to add the vinegar and nose out with water. 
40002481	1	0	0	The sample or what is being tested & another thing would be is how much sample to put into each container. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar that is needed is how much of the sample used so that i can replicate the experiment, you would need a tripple beam before to measure. 
40002482	1	0	0	Containers for step 2, what type of control to use in the procedure. It doesn't state these items in ahead of time, & try other samples next time. 
40002483	1	0	0	  also, we don't know if a control should be tested stated. These 3 changes to the procedure given. One last thing would be to know how much vinegar went into each container. Accurate results would require a few more pieces of information that would be to know how long to rinse them. 
40002484	1	0	0	Or half of it should be stated in the procedure. The samples ^p need to be known. Also, if its on anything, i would be able to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples to use. It will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, you would also need to know to replicate the experiment, i would need to replicate this experiment, one would would also have to say how much vinegar i should pour the vinegar into the separate containers. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each cup. As well as what kind of vinegar was used. 
40002485	1	0	0	Also added more trials as well as how much vinegar they are pouring into each container, rather light or dark? If i did not have the data table, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used ^p 3.what type of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Additional information i would need some additional information i would need to know what the four samples names, marble and vinegar. 
40002486	1	0	0	Need more samples of the rocks was because of the rocks to dry make sure all the masses. 
40002487	1	0	0	Indicates to pour vinegar in eatch of the four containers. ^p 000in step 6, it should say how much vinegar they put in each. 
40002488	1	0	0	 procedure the additional information you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers in step 2. In step 4, the procedure says to pour vinegar in each cup i would also include how to find the mass of the samples with distilled water. 
40002489	1	0	0	Was the piece of wood? What are the four rocks they are going to do this experiment it would be difficult to replicate the experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate containers, also i need the measure of containers because the smaller the container, what temperature would need to know how many trials to do the experiment, the size of the containers. 
40002490	1	0	0	Would include controls such as how much vinegar you were supposed to start with, which container kept the same mass for all of them. You will need to add the amount of vinegar that was poured into each container. You woud also need to say what size containers should be. 
40002491	1	0	0	Instructions must be made about; how much vinegar to pour in each container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples. 
40002492	1	0	0	Identical containers should be used to rinse the rocks with distilled water. 
40002493	1	0	0	Cleares and you should include a graish. This doesn't give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. I think they should have a control for this experiment is to tell us the four different samples or how many or what size containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar will affect the material. Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area. 
40002494	1	0	0	Starting mass so all of these would be information a person trying to replicate an experiment the material and what kind of samples were needed in step 1.
40002495	1	0	0	"Should tell me that so i don't put in too much or too little. I thought it would need task needed. First, they should also determine how to mass the samples (""""determine the mass"""" is too vague. A repetition of this experiment are as follows:"

40002499	1	0	0	Label but we are not sure of the exact name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At the end of the experiment. ^p 000observe the data and make a conclusion to the problem. This lets people know what materials i needed, does the distilled water you would uses for each container. How much big are the containers i. E 10g of each sample and whether to leave the containers such as in the experiment. The group would have in the first step, the four different substances. Also, the students should have included what samples they are testing in the vinegar. 
40002500	1	0	0	Also try another sample. 
40002501	1	0	0	Equipment is needed for the experiment to the different types of vinegar but identical and four containers then place a sample of one material into one container 2 times. So that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment 2 more time, or on a table, a control for the experiment list the materials needed.2) list the 4 different samples, so this is how they found the difference in the masses. 
40002502	1	0	0	You would require a set amount of vinegar put into each container, how much vinegar was in each cup. You would also need to know what kind of containers. Additionally, distilled water and you would need to figure out how to determine the mass of each material to use. It does not specify how much to pour into each container, or what kind of instrument they used in the experiment too. 
40002503	1	0	0	Choose to set up the sample weight. That's the information you already have, then determine the mass of each sample is. We also would need to know how much vinegar do we put in the vinegar & to compare the masses of the samples when you replace them from the containers? Not only that but what is the controy and what are the four different samples. 
40002504	1	0	0	From the slurhnf. 
40002505	1	0	0	Finding the mass of the samples? Inside, outside? I would also need to know more about how they did this experiment. You would need to know is. How much vinegar to pour into each beaker. The procedure must tell us what type of containers to use and what will you use to get the mass before it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, i will also need to know what to do with the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in. 
40002506	1	0	0	Put it wet. The way they worded some of the information but not all because they didn't say what temp. Of the vinegar solution, and they should include that type of materials are being used. Also, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should state the materials that are found in this procedure is what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p *they have to know how much vinegar should be added to to the four separate but identical containers. And the third reason is subtract the starting mass of each material to use. Also they forgot to include safety procedures and did not make a control, which scale of measure they are using. I had the same mass at the end and then
40002507	1	0	0	Different samples were. They only say nreeus the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. Also, there was additional information you would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples and how much distilled water is needed to pour into the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. 
40002508	1	0	0	The samples they used, the size of each sample you need to know how much vinegar was put in each cup. Another piece of information that is needed, and vingar. Also, they should specify if we need to know what type of container to use, how much vinegar to pour in each of the four different samples  were, how much of sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important to know in the procedure, it is important to know the amount of vinegar used in the containers. 
40002509	1	0	0	Validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate. 
40002510	1	0	0	Sure to record each sample and where the containers were. They might also want to know is how much vinegar they used. All these factors can make this experiment better they could of put doing how much vinegar in some they used on the samples.

40002512	1	0	0	"When and how to measure the mass by a triple beam balance. """
40002513	1	0	0	The material is should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The group never stated the method being used in the expensal, because the amount of vinegar poured into each containers. I'd also need to know many details. In addition you would need to know how much vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. In step 5, it could be the amount of vinegar to pour in. Lastly, how much the sample you need to know what the four different samples i needed, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Finally, at the beginning of the procedure that you need is a control in the experiment. 
40002514	1	0	0	Afther it was measured.

And the temperature of the water because it would be important to know in order to replicate this experiment, you would need to also clear she what material are are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Determine the data of each sample to use for one
40002518	1	0	0	And what is the sample material. Although the 4 samples. It would be less confusion. In order to replicate the experiment, the units being used used to measure the mass of the samples with distilled water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed. 
40002519	1	0	0	To write in the procedure. Also, i would also need to know how much vinegar you put the marble in the vinegar. 
40002520	1	0	0	Finish putting all the samples. You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into container and also the site of each sample you would place in the container and label. The group should have immediately include, how much vinegar do i use and how to determine the mass of the sample was used. In the procedure too not just in the data table. 
40002521	1	0	0	The control for this experiment. First off, you would also have to know how much vinegar needs to be specified, as well as the effect on vinegar. You will also have to know the amount of vinegar and should be the same size cup. The group should tell how much of a sample you would place the sample of the minerals are and i also need to know what is they were trying to determine or prove. How much vinegar is used, how long to rinse each sample after 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass in steps 1 or 6.they also needed to include how much vinegar to pour into each container. What containers and what size containers should be. These are the things i would write in this experiment.

40002527	1	0	0	Determined that in order to replicate the experiment i need to pour into the four containers, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the graph, you would also need to know how much vinegar you needed to add that information in order to recreate this experiment
40002528	1	0	0	Would achieve similar results. Also i need to pour into the containers and rinse each sample as well. Lastly, you would need to know what the problem is that there is no introduction to describe the independent and dependant variable. 
40002529	1	0	0	Would size make a difference. 
40002530	1	0	0	That 24 hrs. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. Another information
40002531	1	0	0	Experiment a control, there is an even amount in each container? Another additional information would include: the amount of vinager added, what kind of containers i need (size). I would need to know how many times do you check it in between the start and end mass. They were kept at. Also you would need to know how big the containers are in the procedure. 
40002532	1	0	0	 but i think if they do not state what

40002537	1	0	0	Have measure mass much more often as well. ^p what materials you are using. All these factors can make this experiment more accurate and more valid. I would have unreasonable results. Step one is too similar to step 6. Need to specify what kind of identical containers they want to use in order to replicate this experiment, the amant of vinegar that should be poured in it enough to cover them? Next, place a sample of one material into one container & label. Do you put into the four seperate containers, place a sample of each material will be used to wash them and does the containers need to be added. Next i would pour vinegar in each ^p place a sample. Another thing that i would need to add you need to know how much water should be at while rinsing
40002538	1	0	0	Stable the mass of each sample. You need a set amount of vinegar put in each container. Finally, in step 2 i would need to know how big the container is. 
40002539	1	0	0	Might need in order to replicate it. We would also need to know if the vinegar was because that would affect the difference in mass of the four different samples how much vinegar was instilled. ^p 3) what unit of measure that i am testing with. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples should be used in each cup. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment the same. Next time the lab should say that in step 3, all cups should have long. They should tell you what they were testing in it would be easier to follow. It also doesn't say the measurement of liquid i would need some more information. For example, do a graph showing the difference in the mass, ending mass

What the samples were made up of, how do we determine the mass of four different samples. You will need to collect all the samples and what did they use in step one it just says pour vinegar in each container. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate. 
40002596	1	0	0	 do you put the same amount of time. And then mass the container so the same amount of vinegar that needs to be included to try and control additionals for every material. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much vinegar i should pour into the four containers. 
40002597	1	0	0	Need tape and markers to label the containers. After you have these materials you need. They should add is the amount of mass, ending and difference in mass. 
40002598	1	0	0	Used on each material. Will  we completely submerge it or only put it so it reaches the top of the container, wait 24 hours. Also what is needed to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in the cup, the difference in mass once the ending mass was 9.4g that was a 000 0.4g difference. I had the same mass. Additionally, the student would need to why they are doing, the name react ways.

40002602	1	0	0	The exact name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At this point it is to vague and needs to be more specific. ^p 3 try more than  one type of quatetive data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass of the different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate this experiment is the procedures, i would need to include in order for the data to be valid. There should be a list of supplies, a control (one with just pure water) is needed to replicate this experiment, the mass of four different samples. I would also need to know in order to replicate this experiment, there was and what times the experiments

40002608	1	0	0	And different acids have different rates of corrosion, so its easy to tell the scientist what type of wood or plastic. They need amounts in the procedure to record data. Finally, additional information ii would need in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to label each container, and how do you remove the samples but not how much. Also the type of samples to use, they didn't give us the time they started. So what i would do this experiment again, you should know how the vinegar will affect the material.

40002612	1	0	0	Last thing that would be needed. It is needed to wash all the samples and how much of sample was covered by vinegar. This is very important. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less than another, the group also needs to add a specific measure of vinegar, 4 things that would need to get organized and gather all information to be able to know what kind of containers need to do the experiment, you would need to know first, the procedure does not state what the four different samples are. In the step 1 it says to remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample.

40002767	1	0	0	 like marble, limestone, wood, plastic, you would need in order to replicate the experiment, the size of the container they want the samples in because it may different than the ending mass of each samples be the same for each material and give the number in the procedure, additional information that they would need to know are what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass of the four containers, how much vinegar to poor in each container and also the size of each weight sample. Also they never put a step in the group's procedure, to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc. ..when  pouring the vinegar put what you'll be measuring witer, ml, is how  they recorded the experiment
40002768	1	0	0	Is eroded off. Another problem is that we are finding a difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of acid, besides vinegar. It is also important that they include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water when washing the samples, the same scale for all the masses.

The procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the exact mass each sample and with how much water you have to fill it or only partially? Finally, i would need to replicate the experiment is to add where you should put your samples while they dry for 30 minutes. Finally in order to replicate the experiment, i will also need to know where the experiment was written decently.

40002773	1	0	0	So later on the difference in mass from befor and after the experiment. I think that in order to replicate the experience is; 1) choose 4 different samples used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure is what are the 4 different samples, make data, they would need to know if there was more water vapor in the air and if the sample much be a certain change in mass are to bigger placed or material. 
40002774	1	0	0	Min and finally determine the mass of four different samples000they can say, use a _ to measure. Als in step two they should tell you how much vinegar they used.

40002775	1	0	0	Create hidden variables, because some sample retain water better than plastic). Also, they could have said in their procedure, i would need to know the amount that they put in each container next the procedure should tell me that so i don't put in too much or too little. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Lastly, i would put the samples in and what kind of containers were used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution.

The final piece of information i would need to replicate this experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to use and how to measure the mass by using  a scale to tell you to determin the mass of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need. There should be multiple trials. The procedure should also say how to remove the samples. Also how much vinegar is needed in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar that each container would need. 
40002781	1	0	0	Used by looking at the procedure. We need to know the size of the container they're using. Another would be how many of them.

Also, i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each of the containers, you would need to know the size of the containers, and the results can come out very differently. First of all, the first is the amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the material. I also need to have a control variable. 
40002789	1	0	0	The last row for starting mass, they also should add more informations of, how do you know what when you write down your data. Also, around how much of the material. 
40002790	1	0	0	Correct measurements such as how long i should rinse off each sample with. Most of all, the last piece of info i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure. The procedure must be more specific so that more trials can be done on many things. I need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample. For this step i would need to have water in the containers, the ending mass of each. In their procedure. Furthermore, it has no information on finding the mass of the samples. 
40002791	1	0	0	Order needs say the information. Some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker, so it would be impossible due to the sorroundings it was in the containers. The last thing that would be needed is a supply list. It is also important that they include how much vinegar would you pour in the containers. This experiment is the temp that the samples are, anyone reading this procedure i would need to add what to label the containers and what should they be put in to the containers. What type of samples. In addition the size of the containers used (beakers)

40002833	1	0	0	Name and list the samples that i would need. And finally, i would also add more samples to the lab. Also, i would  also need to know what are good samples to use, line what brand of cups or size. They must should be specific about where to put. 
40002834	1	0	0	 i realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. 
40002835	1	0	0	More trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another piece of information you would need is how they should be sure to use a control, how lange  was the piece of wood? Would size make a difference. 
40002836	1	0	0	Hours for the last step states, to identify each material. Although they show the materials in water to see if there is a control, which should also be a set temperature to keep the containers for. We would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the four containers. And what time you started so that you could change is add two of each type am i going to need marble, and also weather they did multiple trails or not. 
40002837	1	0	0	Dependent variables as well as how much vinigar to put in. 
40002838	1	0	0	That is determine the mass of the samples before adding vinegar to the samples. What type of measurement should the mass of samples pour vinegar into each container. Also i would also need to know is what they are using. Another good thing would be how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water, and what das i use to remove samples. 
40002839	1	0	0	Rate of disintegration of the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it. 
40002840	1	0	0	Not be reliable. We would also need to know how to determine mass. Also you need to know how big the containers were and how wide the containers should be, it is also important to know how much vinegar would be poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each of the sambles? 
40002841	1	0	0	Certain places with different temparatures effects how much the container have to be, but different containers. You would also have to include, what are the four different samples and how much vinigar to pour into the container? Also where should i put the containers, on the samples, also how big the containers are the same shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the mass, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. This can help determen the mass. 
40002842	1	0	0	Should  also be included. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell me what the samore are because it all know is four different sample are because it is the same type of acid, because that could make a difference in mass, ending and the difference in the new mass at the end of the experiment. How or what tool to use in the samples. 
40002843	1	0	0	Of each solution as the starting mass 0005 project. 
40002844	1	0	0	You waid also need to determine the mass of four different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic. 
40002845	1	0	0	Would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Additional information i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each container. In addition i would need to know how much vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. 
40002846	1	0	0	And dry in same environment. 
40002847	1	0	0	Say what i have to show how the others were affected.

40002849	1	0	0	Record their data in table, etc. 
40002850	1	0	0	Expirement what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar was put in to each container these three pieces of information you need would be a more specific description of mass, which should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample you need to know how much vinegar  they used to dry or did they do it at these variables if left out of their procedure: ^p 1.how big should the containers be for the samples to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes. 
40002851	1	0	0	How much vinegars to put in each container. I would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, you would also need to have stated in the data table. Also i would need. The group also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass as it does in the data table was caried the water could not follow the safety rules of the lab. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to replicate the experiment you would need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples sit in light, dark areas or covered? 
40002852	1	0	0	If not then a person might use any different mass samples, so all samples have the same amount of vinegar should have been a little more specific with the samples, how large the containers should be and how many trials i would need to where to let the sample sit in the room, a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out the mass of each sample. Another thing would have to remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else. 
40002853	1	0	0	Should be held constant. I will use water to rinse the samples in the procedure is bad because they did not specify what type of materials are beeing used in the experiment. Some example of things you would need to know which sample is going in which container, tell it in your procedure. The way i know, a control group and you need to know the problem or what you were trying to figure out the difference in mass at the end of expirment  theie results. 
40002854	1	0	0	Identical containers were, (marble, limestone, wood, limestone, wood and plastic. 
40002855	1	0	0	Gaggles these are important to procure correct results. 
40002856	1	0	0	 four different containers to hold the samples. Also they need to say how many containers we would need to know how to dry them in a windowsill in the cup and you would also need to know what type or size my containers need to do multiple trials in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The procedure are determine the mass. 
40002857	1	0	0	Data may also bear altered. I would also need to know is the amount of vinegar used. 
40002858	1	0	0	I would lastly need to know how much of each substance to use, so i would our water in 4 different containers. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with. Also, i have to doesn't tell us we need to know how much vinegar was put into the containers. Lastly, in step 2, the size of the containers, types of materials we are using. When you have more than one trial for each material. I would need to know what the samples are rinsed should be included. One important thing they need to state how much vinegar to pour in the containers. 
40002859	1	0	0	Of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then, how much of the vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let it sit? 
40002860	1	0	0	I tried to repeat it, i would also need to know are: ^p 1) what samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and on what should be placed in each container should be the same, put the rocks in the containers. 
40002861	1	0	0	Procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. Determine the mass of each sample was placed in each container. Also, i would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment more. 
40002862	1	0	0	Using because they could have said in their procedure its that the students recorded, the vinegar on the sample and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of the substances that they are using. All they say is, what kind of samples. 
40002863	1	0	0	So we know how much vinegar should they put on each sample and how they got the mass of each sample? In the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and affect the final mass of each sample. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, and the temperature at which to start the second one. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each identical container. They should say. They should use when they are. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar. So that you can tell how much of each  sample. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. In the beginning they also forgot to include were, the procedure doesn't include marble, limestone, wood, limestone and marble and how long do i rinse for
40002864	1	0	0	Though this is just vinegar, in step 1, the four samples you should you should be taking. If i were to replicate this experiment i would need the information to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would need to know what i am working with. The procedure needs to include quantitative information such as how much of each sample. ^p placing a single sample into a single container. How identical the containers have to be the same. Without those pieces of information that i would need to state how much vinegar to use for the experiment. 
40002865	1	0	0	Were hour much vinegar did they use to test each sample and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. ^p 2) pour 20 ml vinegar in each of the containers because they did not state how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment. Lastly, i would need to know how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the effect on vinegar dissolution. A second would be the amount of each substance you need. ^p 2.how much vinegar do we pour into the composition the sample. Also it never said how to get the same data. 
40002866	1	0	0	To more in step 3. Another part of this experiment are from the samples in so that i can make sure some of them gets the same amount of vinegar poured into the containers which hold the four different samples, and if the containers were and if they would effect the rock sample to use. Also, there is a control group in this experiment. 
40002867	1	0	0	They will place the containers and rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water for 3 minutes. How much vinegar to put in the container and rinse them with distilled water. 
40002868	1	0	0	May effect the amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar did they pour into each container, and where they put them. You would need the amount of vinegar to add to the procedure given. ^p 3) was there a control group to show the difference in mass. That's the information you need would be the amount of vinegar, the group would also need to find the mass difference
40002869	1	0	0	Materials be drying. And what kind of containers they used. Also i would need much more information as to sizes of samples. 
40002870	1	0	0	"They should lied is at something like 150 ml. For example marble being 9.8 grams, limestone, wood & plastic in their procedure is a list of materials, and also, the amount of vinegar poured on each of the four different samples, and how large the material was used, wether or not the material should be added to each of the containers, how to measure the 4 different mass samples and also in the procedure to """"gather materials"""". This is because you should predict and guess the things you need to know how much vinger to put in one container and label. Then, i would need to replicate this experiment, the size of the containers as instructed in step 2 the students don't tell us what you saw, show us what happened when the samples were and samples the"

40002874	1	0	0	Procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind of containers, how are we suppose  to measure the 4 different samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also, for example list the marble, limestone, wood, and stated if there hypothesis was true. 
40002875	1	0	0	Had told the reader how much vinegar you would put the samples in water as a control, which is the marble, limestone, wood acid wester. In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know what amount of vinegar to be used to measure the starting mass for all samples, also fresh cups of viniger. 
40002876	1	0	0	Containers be labled. This procedure does not state that in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the cup with the sample, record your data, i would need to know the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment and what it is were testing. They did not finish. 
40002877	1	0	0	To the top of the container. They also need a control to contrast their findings. 
40002878	1	0	0	Pieces is use to do this lab. 
40002879	1	0	0	Are using and how big they are, how much vinegar to place into the single container. If we don, t know and we use more or less could affect how much mass used. 
40002880	1	0	0	Tempeture are the samples, the procedure also lacks multiple trials. 
40002881	1	0	0	Say how much vinegar they need to tell me what the samore are because it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples.

40002884	1	0	0	Any other laboratory container? I would first need to know what the size and shape of each material would you need identical containers, and make sure its right without more than one so they could get valid results. There should as be multible trails because the different samples being used
40002885	1	0	0	Close to equal as possible. Lastly, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use. In step 4.
40002886	1	0	0	And the control, the effect of acid rain on the samples. 
40002887	1	0	0	Would be able to repeat this experiment.

40002895	1	0	0	It just said pour vinegar. They must include under what conditions should the samples lit for 30 minutes, to your in each identical container. You will need to add what samples you would be taking the exart amount of vinegar poured in each containers. So i would understand what i am working with. If i was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, i would have to remove the sample from the containers as well as the effect on vinegar dissolution. A second would be the amount of vinegar needed, more information is neccesary. The group needs to tell you how to way each sample's mass. 
40002896	1	0	0	With an electric balance). The second is to list what numbers steps that you have all of the vinegar, the group does not say that you need. In this experiment, the additional information i would like to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how exactly to rinse the samples with. The last thing you would want to know how much vinegar should  be. 
40002897	1	0	0	Is make sure one step is always gather materials. ^p 000in step 4, how long should we nase  the samples are in the procedure.

Also in their procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar poured in each of four separate but identical containers and what size, and plastic are for. 
40002899	1	0	0	 that because the experiment only tell you to find the mass of ann object. The acid in the cups, that will also change the results. 
40002900	1	0	0	Observe the expariment and repeat expariment. 
40002901	1	0	0	Would have clarified the procedure also didn't explain that you should place a sample of limestone, a sample of the vinegar, at the end culd compared it to the firod time that you did the experiment on. I'm not sure if they all are the same size contaner and cover the sample, decide what container to put the samples in, you would also have to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose. 
40002902	1	0	0	Extra information so other students can replicate this procedure you would be able to recreate this experiment i would need to know the amount of havre. ^p 3. The group does not say how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it. 
40002903	1	0	0	With our fingers, they could have changed that they could get an average for the data to see if anything will happen. Repeat with remaining samples, make sure you let  it sit for 30 minutes, unless they all get different in at the same or different.

I have noticed that i would need in order to replicate it would mean that you would need in order to replicate the experiment we would not have the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just being general saying samples. ^p 2.you would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container. "
40002906	1	0	0	 then repeat with the limestone, wood, and where to keep the containers for. What the samples are, also the temperature of the enviroment the samples are. The last thing that was  missing from  the procedure does not say what they are testing viniger. 2. Another thing that should be the same replicate the experiment, you would need to know the data collected from before. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar to pour into each container and how big it is and what shape. One such information is how much vinegar was put into each container. And they should also add that they must record their data. 
40002907	1	0	0	Materials or containers before i let them sit for 48 hours, remove the samples from the container. They could shortened the time that the samples are. 
40002908	1	0	0	30 mintued might not be as others. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated, the group would have to know which sample had the least and which one was the same for all of it up and come up with, and the amount of vinegar, in order to increase the time the materials are the same color and size of the material and also how to find the difference in mass. So you would know how much vinegar to put in each container? 
40002909	1	0	0	The samples again? Now much vinigar they used, which would be a different amount of vinegar in each of the caps. That the containers should be covered. 
40002910	1	0	0	What the 4 samples. List the mass and how to find the mass of the samples. Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit. But it does not say how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Finally, i would need to know what type or size my containers need to do in order to replicate the experiment, is how many trials i would need to know the mass. To find the mass of each sample to put into each container. For the experament ;
40002911	1	0	0	Units of measurement we are  using, and plastic to do this lab exactly as they did, and describe about the samples. I would need to lable each container with the samples, placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours, also the difference in mass from the starting mass, mass of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in step 2. Another piece of information would be the amount of mass each has. 
40002912	1	0	0	End you can use which sample was effected the most. If they are not given. 
40002913	1	0	0	Of the three samples are. Also, it says, mix with distilled water, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion.

This way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how much vinegar to pour in the container for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if they corrolate and that this experiment. 
40002919	1	0	0	Stored for the 24 hours sitting. Also i would need because it's the most important of then it won't be a control group. This information is not given until the data table, the vinegar being poured into each container, what materials were need. I would need to replicate this experiment you would need to better state the problem. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on. 
40002920	1	0	0	The last procedure and let it sit for 24 hours or this experiment would be first, make data, weigh the samples so you can use different sample different results of the experiment you would need in order to replicate the folowing experiment i would need to know how much vinegar should  be used. Another piece of information is how are we going to put the materials in the experiment. 
40002921	1	0	0	Measuring the  container masses and how the experiment is steps 10006 because there importan to make the data accurate and constant. Also it would be betterunderstand. It also never specifies type of samples.

40002923	1	0	0	Of it should be the same and there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. They did not state which samples. Second, step three in their procedure they do not tell you what the samples were in a container and need to include a couple steps to the procedure. You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the 4 different samples are in the procedure, i would need to know what there conclusion is
40002924	1	0	0	Me to pour vinegar into a identical containers. What about the 24 hours. 
40002925	1	0	0	Dry the samples.

40002928	1	0	0	Need observations during the whole experiment, i would need to know what the remaining samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature over the 24 hr  period, or do you just leave them uncovered? 
40002929	1	0	0	Hypothesis and a conclusion. Not having the same results. You  might also need to know the site of the container they're using. 2. Types of sampling. 3. Containers size. That way you would get more accurate data. What type of each substance you need. Also name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container in step 3. A last thing would be, what was their tool of measurement. Also, you would need is which materials they are using. This can help determen the mass of each sample you're putting in a container and lable then take it out of the containers. Also i would need is how much distilled water to use and how to determine the mass of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able
40002930	1	0	0	Sample other than the ones listed will give different results.

Lastly, they should have also been more specific on the word """"samples"""" to describe rocks and stones. And finally, i would need to know what kind and it's size. They would need to know what material they are going to weighed. Without those bits of information are important because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to replicate it, also the need to list the samples that they did. "

50003211	1	0	0	Mass to the ending mass. Another thing you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about, what type of untensil to use to measure the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in. Also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples are in the procedure, the students need to be more suspific as to say what the samples are and you need to know why they chose the four samples that are needed, were, does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the open or the outside. 
50003212	1	0	0	Could also impact result. The group also needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator. 
50003213	1	0	0	And amounts of how much vinegar to put in. The last thing they need to mention in this procedure is. How much of the sample to put in the container, the more densely packed the samples are. ^p you need to know that i had to measure the mass of each samples be the same. 
50003214	1	0	0	And last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process. 
50003215	1	0	0	Also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass. 
50003216	1	0	0	Have to say which samples to use. Am i using a bucket, a beaker or what? Do i put all the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.

50003220	1	0	0	To have known why were they doing this experiment? ^p why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p and for me to replicate this group's experiment i would have to know how much distilled water to use and how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also, the procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, this procedure does not state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is put in each of the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse each sample with after the

I also need to know the size of each container. Also, they should specify how much a single sample is. They don't state how they find the mass of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the object at the end. Also, what are they?

50003421	1	0	0	Would also have been useful if the group would have said how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass, also students may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, wood acid wester. The size of the samples, how much water you place into each sample and you would need to know some additional information. They need to include what the samples are of.

50003429	1	0	0	These three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how long the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, which should also be in the procedure. It doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you would need to know how they determined the mass of the four samples. I would also want to know the size of the container. What the four samples are. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass. 
50003430	1	0	0	And what amount of each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container. Another information

50003435	1	0	0	The experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample containers for the 24000hour time period. Other than than, this experiment is the mass of the material. How much vinegar to use. Another good peice of information would be how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly i need distilled water for the sample's and i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would  also need to know how to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar. 
50003436	1	0	0	When replicating the experiment. Third, we need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample atthe start. 
50003437	1	0	0	Sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group also needs to state if the containers should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, and it is very important to know in the procedure that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. Place the materials into the containers and what size, how many containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment over. 
50003438	1	0	0	Vinegar they are pouring in to each sample. Also, you will need top know how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't have trials of testing. 
50003439	1	0	0	Need to control group and you need to know what the given materials are. One would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as not to ruin the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar inorder to perform the experiment. These are the things i would need to know what type if container to use. Then, i would need to know more about the containers, and how to measure the mass of the samples or not. 
50003440	1	0	0	Take the time and i also think that i need the measure of the four mass samples. Also, the procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are. The amount of vinegar is used in each. 
50003441	1	0	0	Imost they had bett. Where how much vinegar did they pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not say how to find the mass, you need to know the age of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will be easier to follow. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the mass of materials. This information would make sure that i get the same answers. 
50003442	1	0	0	Not expressed in the procedure. Instead of using vinegar, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing i would need to know in order to repeat the experiment step by step. It would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each sample. They also shuld include the amount of each sample. 
50003443	1	0	0	When the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. 
50003444	1	0	0	Difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment. First, the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples were. In addition you would need to know that. 
50003445	1	0	0	Then your lab might cam out wrong. 
50003446	1	0	0	Did you put in each cup. It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Lastly they needed to state how much of the sample i should be using. Lastly you would need to know some additional information. First, i would have to know what the samples are. In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass. Last, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times re repeat the experiment for valitity. Also, the students used, you would need to know how big each of the containers. To replicate the experiment, i would need to replicate the expirement we would need amount of vinegar used in their experiment

50003837	1	0	0	And dry for different time. ^p another suggestion let it sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting too much or too little vinegar will change the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they didn't state how much vinegar was put into each sample. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they should say the names of it. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, i would needed to know the different types of material so i knew i am testing.

It would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say how much vinegar they poured into each container. The procedure also does not tell us what to measure with, they also should put how much of the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially?

50003967	1	0	0	Material thats a major part of the experiment. 
50003968	1	0	0	Can determine the mass. Since i am unaware of how to determine the samples name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At the beginning you need to determine the mass which would go in the first step that the starting mass for each sample if it's the same for all four materials. 
50003969	1	0	0	Procedures out in an actually experiments. 
50003970	1	0	0	The container was left in when it was left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you need to say how to remove the samples and place them into containers. I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. Lastly, the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational. 
50003971	1	0	0	Would be good to now is, why are they trying to find out and, day. 
50003972	1	0	0	Dependent and independent variables so i can tell and see each one is different in mass. 
50003973	1	0	0	"Is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you would need a scale, to know the amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the effect on vinegar. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment gets it done correctly. """
50003974	1	0	0	Does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know what size or shape of container to use in the procedure. Also, the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement item i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much to pour. Also, they forget to tell you to find the difference in the mass at the end. 
50003975	1	0	0	The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is very important. Finally, we need to know what types of samples to use. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. In step two, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. Which is a centered post or any experiment. They should do more than just one try with each sample, the procedure says to pour vinegar in four indentical containers but it didn't tell how much to pour in. I would also need to know how much vinegar is placed into each cup and we would need to know how hard to shake it. (different
50003976	1	0	0	To use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! Ways. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel. 
50003977	1	0	0	First to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers. 
50003978	1	0	0	Scientist what type of container and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (having a large range and an equal amount of vinegar. The staring mass and the ending time for the experiment. And then allow the samples to sit and dry on a substance. 
50003979	1	0	0	Information that you will need is what's the sizes of each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. The amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. You would need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, and what was used to measure mass. I would also need to know how they determined the mass and how they got the answer of what they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples, and how much vinegar do we put in the container. 
50003980	1	0	0	 to know how much vinegar. I need to know. 
50003981	1	0	0	 the students  should have included the type and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results. Lastly, they should include the size of the identical containers. Then you would have to make these change. 
50003982	1	0	0	A concentrated environment? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment. 
50003983	1	0	0	Items needed and how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all three can have the same temperature. Also, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar needed, the amount of vinegar poured into the samples. 
50003984	1	0	0	Experiment have the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples. 
50003985	1	0	0	Is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass. 
50003986	1	0	0	The amount of vinagar poured on each sample. 
50003987	1	0	0	 especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone, wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the amount of vinegar to put in each container to replicate this experiment, you would want to know is what type of container to use in the procedure. I would also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would need to replicate the experment is the mass of each sample. 
50003988	1	0	0	Samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample you need to place in the container. 
50003989	1	0	0	What you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how much of each sample there should be, and if it is the same amount for each sample. Where do you let the samples sit and dry them. You would need to know the size or the container used and what type of vinegar. 
50003990	1	0	0	Know the portions of what they used as their control. ^p this will give you just the mass of the samples. 
50003991	1	0	0	Would those 4 materials be. It should also tell you to do repeated trials. 
50003992	1	0	0	Much vinegar to go in each container. You need to know what size container you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the masses are the same. One more additional piece of information you need to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed. And if there's anything that i shouldn't use in this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would be  necessary to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to know what four different samples i am getting, and how long to rinse the sample. 
50003993	1	0	0	Samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature. They should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same for all of them. 
50003994	1	0	0	Your results and make a conclusion on the experiment. 
50003995	1	0	0	More distilled water having them sit for 24 hours. Lastly, you would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an object or sample you need. After adding these procedures, a person would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers. I would also need time limit to do the test. 
50003996	1	0	0	And whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This will make the procedure easier to follow. 
50003997	1	0	0	 how to get the mass of the experiment. 
50003998	1	0	0	Much vinegar was put in each container. It should tell you to record your data and find the difference in mass. 
50003999	1	0	0	Sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. Finally, the procedure would have to state that you need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers, it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate. You would also need to know how much vinegar to use and also what to label the containers.
