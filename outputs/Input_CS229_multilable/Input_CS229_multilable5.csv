The mRNA travels to the ribosomes. At the ribosomes the mRNA is copied so that is can be used to create proteins.The copies mRNA is then used as instructions to create proteins.The proteins are made, using the instructions given.	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.	1

Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.

After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal.

1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome.

Well the first step is basically just the mRNA leaving the nucleus and then moving on up in the world, because you know what? The nucleus wasn't a very happy being, ultimately ending with the mRNA not liking the treatment he was recieving so he left.

There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, and then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce, or use them for energy.	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.

Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.	1.  The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2.  tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it.  It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.  3.  The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4.  The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins.	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.	0
The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are when the DNA is being replicated, when rRNA is being produced, when tRNA is being produced and when mRNA is being changed.

first you go to prophase then from prophase you go to metaphase from metaphase you go to anaphase from anaphase you go to telephase during all these steps you start offf with two cell then you have the cells seprating into two seprate one then they just end as being one cell	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome.
