There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it.

To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.

In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container.

"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples.

In this table it's says that first when starting mass that time marble was 9.8 then it's decrease it would 9.4. So it's decrease -0.4. In limestone the mass is decreas too. First, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. In starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too. So it's in no change. In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's in difference beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change.

To replicate a better experiment, the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container. If one container has more than the other, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results. Lastly, they shouldn't use the already used material to replicate the experiment. Some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker, so those are all factors the group of students should add.	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment.

"They would need to explain how their experiment went. So they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the mass of each. So this is how they should explain their experiment. ""We've tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The mass of each were marble 4.8, limestone 10.4, wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2. When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1.

One thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sample you would need to set. If you don't know what sample to use, then the experiment is useless. Also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers. And finally, you should know what to weigh your sample on and if you should set the weigher to 0 before weighing it in. You need to know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you don't know which are to use, then your lab might cam out wrong.

In order to replicate this experiment, the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail. First, a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added. Next, the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container. Another step they did not add was to re-label the samples after they are removed from vinegar, in order to tell them a part from each other.
