Cells use vesicles, transport chains, and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane. Vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances. When the vesicle dies, so does the cell.Transport chains carry many things across the cell. This way, equilibrium is reached, RNA can leave the cell, and many other things can occur to keep the cell going.Protions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell. They open and have the particles attatch to them. They then close and open up on the opposite side.

Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable.

Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	0
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.  ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.  The protein channels allow certain things to come through.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	1

THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	0
The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through.

Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite.

Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.	The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	0

Active transport:  It is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells.  The cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not.  Distribution: The cell membrane will also use distribution to decide what items go to each part of the cell and how much will be sent to the organelles.  These items could be things like water or other fluids.Seperation: The cell membrane can decide at any time what to seperate in a cell or out of the cell.  It can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell.

A concentration gradient is the movement from a bound structure into another, so therefor this would be one way cells control movement. Another way is organelles. Organelles all have different purposes of being in the cell, some may perform the task on controling what comes in and out of a cell. Another way is the Lysosomes because they are the 'digesters' in the cell so this would export substances that are not needed.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

The cell membrane has several ways to let things in and out of the cell. The cell membrane is made of up phospate heads and lipid tails. These are next to each other creating a solid block for the cell. Things that let things in and out of the cell are a mitchochondra. These lets things transport in and out of the cell. Some things are so microscopic that they can go through the cell wall and back without being noticed. Some have to be checked for safety by the cell membrane to make sure everything inside of the cell is save. Even though these methods are used some things are very small and can fit through the cell membrane and go into the cell without even  being noticed, this is where different things come in and help out the cell.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	0
Equillibrium, which is when they move across the membrane until both sides are balanced. Diffusion, which is when the substances diffuse across the membrane either into or out of the cell membrane. And when bacteria or another harmful substance tries to get into the cell, the cell membrane doesn't let them through. They do everthing they can to protect the nucleus.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

There are three main types of movement but I personly dont know them.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration.

Another form of moving substances is passive diffusion, which is making the enviornment inside and outside the cell equal. This takes no effort and can move more than just water but other soultions as well. Lastly, another way to move a substance is facilitated diffusion which is moving a substaince against the concentraition gradient.

One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that there is a cell membrane which is semi-permeable. Semi-permeable means that only certain things can get into the cell. This type of membrane controls the movement of substances across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Another process used by cells would be information transfer where organelles in the cell transport DNA and rNA throughout the cell's system. A third process used by cells is when the lysosome come around and sort of 'clean up' dead organells and recycle them. This affects the cell because then certain organelles are dead and can no longer help the cell or move around in it.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion are the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. In osmosis, it is the movement from higher concentration to lower concentration across a membrane. The soutes are being dissolved in to the solvent and can readily do so on their own. With this there are three types of solutions: hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. In facilitated diffusion, it is movement from higher to lower concntration across the membrane as well with tings that can not readily pass through on their own. These then use the help of thing such as sodium potassium pumps and ion channels. in diffusion, it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration. These things do not need assitance passing through and can readily do this own their own unitl they reach equilibrium, in which all things are balanced and even.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

The first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport. This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is active transport. This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane, from being in a less dense to more dense side. This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis. The cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly, and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in, allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Cells have a selectively permeanble membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them.  This happens in two ways, osmosis and diffusion.  Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things.  One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport.  When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.  Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport.  Passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.

Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane.  Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.

In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.	0
Osmosis- water is transfered through thte cell from less concentrated to more concentrated. Diffusion- many substances are transfered to and from the cell through the cell membrane.Symbiosis-	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration.

Of these three processes, one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer protiens, another way is through absorbing the substances threw the membrane into the cell, the last way is that the membrane allows the substance to enter the cell.	1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.
