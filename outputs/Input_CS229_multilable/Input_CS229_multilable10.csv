light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the doghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black . The color black which absorbs a lot of energy , results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as light gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures . Based on the experiment , the results show that that light gray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45 ( DEG ) C , 8 ( DEG ) C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures .

white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat , so the dog wont be as hot . If Brandi and Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ( ( DEG ) C ) was 54 , in trial two its ( ( DEG ) C ) were 52 , in trial 3 its ( ( DEG ) C ) were 54 and the average is 53 . So these results show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not make the dog comfortable with all the heat .

white :: White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for . After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray , dark gray , or black lidded jars . With a starting temprature of 24 ( DEG ) C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53 ( DEG ) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid .

Based on these results , i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat , fewer than darker colors , but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment , the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat . Therefore , light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then the other colors . The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial . The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees , the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress . The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gray because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 ( DEG ) c and 48 ( DEG ) c in the experiment , so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around , they probably already are hot enough . Also if it does get cold , light gray will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temperature was 48 ( DEG ) c which is only 2 ( DEG ) c less than dark gray , so i think light gray will be the best color for the dog house .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the color , the more heat it attracts . For example , during the winter , the dog inside the doghouse might get cold , so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside . But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat , so i picked dark gray instead of black . Also , another example is in the summer time , if the dog doesnt want to go outside , and stays in the doghouse , he doesnt have to be so hot . But he can also go outside if the doghouse is to warm .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse will make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most . Due to the data , a black lid color had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . That will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse much more warmer in temperature . A white lid only had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C , making it too cold for the dog .

light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse . One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse , the dog could overheat . Also , the opposite is true as well . If you had a white doghouse , it may make the dog very cold . The black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , and the white lid had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

white :: the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as does darker colors , for example , in the air temprature expeirament . they put a dark colord lid over ajar , with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius . after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c . but when they put the lighter coverd lid over the jar ( at a starting point of 24c ) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c . so the best choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be best to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives , but not overly heated in the summer . In the experiment , the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48 ( DEG ) . A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog . In the investigation , the air temperature of black was at 53 ( DEG ) . The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog . The air temperatures of the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) and of the white was 42 ( DEG ) . This is why I would choose the dark gray paint for a doghouse .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

white :: It is the brightest color in this selection and the darker the color , the more energy it will absorb . The doghouse will usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun's solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse . Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average column of the data table . By doing so , you can see that White had the lowest average temperature at 42 ( DEG ) C , while the Black had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .

white :: I would choose white because , white does not absorb a lot of light so there for , when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse . I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53 . that is an 11 ( DEG ) c difference between the two colors . So for a dog house I highly considered it being white .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the optimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors , dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature . This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it , and cooler then black in the summer , because it is a lighter shade than black . This will occur from the dark gray paint , because in the experiment , the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53 ( DEG ) . The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42 ( DEG ) . The use of alight gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45 ( DEG ) , and the use of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 ( DEG ) . This shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature , and ideal for a doghouse , because its tempurature was 6 ( DEG ) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure , and 5 ( DEG ) cooler then the hottest tempurature , making dark gray medium in tempurature , and optimal for a dog house .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

black :: This color ( black ) will help the dog house stay/become warmer . Since the dog house is outside , and for the most part its pretty cold outside , the dog house should be black , so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm . Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better . After the 10 minutes , in the experiment , black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius . After the 10 minutes , in the experiment , white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius . So this proves that the darker the color , the more energy it will absorb , making the object warmer .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

light gray :: The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey . This because the light grey would keep the dog house not as hot during like the summer , and warm enough during the winter . From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment , you can see with darker colors on the lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside . With the light grey it would be not to hot or cold . Another choice would be the white but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter , so light grey is the best choice .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

black :: The color black , might affect the inside of the doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the other colors . I think this because in the data from the experiment , the average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53 ( DEG ) C . The Dark gray lid colors average air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48 ( DEG ) C , the air temperature for light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42 ( DEG ) C . Overall , the conclusion you could draw from that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors . In the experiment the black lid had a difference in averages from the coldest air temperature ( the white lid ) by 11 ( DEG ) C .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light grey , because light grey absorbs more heat than white , but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey . Light gray would be perfect , because during the summer , the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot , so the doghouse would'nt be too warm . During the winter , the light gray would absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the winter . I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did ( where they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature ) they found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( DEG ) C . Finnaly , the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that light gray absorbs some heat , but not alot , so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

dark gray :: I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because , it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures . If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat . If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat . Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white . So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat . And that in the winter it does too . So it would be even out in both summer and winter .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperature . The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) , the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 ( DEG ) , and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42 ( DEG ) . Therefore alight gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors . But if you were to use black or dark gray , it would keep the dog house warmer .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

"white :: The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors , then the dog house will get too hot and your dog will be hot aswell . As the study shown , the color black had an average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did . Same as the color black , dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white . Also in the study , the color light gray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degrees celcious hotter than the color white . The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White because the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made , the avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if they paint their dog house this color , the dog house wouldnt get hot nor your dog ."	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy . Their hypothesis was correct . This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute trials was 42 degrees . Because black was the darkest color of the lid , it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest ( and vice versa for the white lid . ) Thus , because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated , the best color to paint it would be white because white would absorb the least heat .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .

light gray :: As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted , we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Knowing this , we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated , so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available . Which in this case , is white . Though , the dog , being alive creature shouldn't get too cold , therefore , light gray is the perfect compromise . Keeping the dog warm enough , but not too hot .	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog . iknow this because in the results black got the hottest .	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to hot because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the white lid had an averge of 42 degrees .
