One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them.

What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation.

Rose's character, I believe, can be summed up in a short few sentences between her and her sister Anna. In paragraph 10, sentence 2, Anna states that in her opinion, 'Money isn't everything.'
