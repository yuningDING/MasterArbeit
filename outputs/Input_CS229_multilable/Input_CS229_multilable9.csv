Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other, and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful.     Finally, the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem.  He/she conveys to the reader that, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' and that scientists need to come up for a solution to this problem before it becomes too large to handle.

Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage.

The author starts the article with a humorous hook to draw the readers attention. The article says, 'Grab you telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' This quote is humorous and simplifies the complex problem of space pollution so that anyone could understand that it's a problem. The author then moves into the history of space junk, and how pieces of junk came to be orbiting the earth. It starts out sayaing, 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' The facts that the author gives explain how the problem came to be, and gives a brief history of space exploration. The author then moves on to describing the risk of satellites colliding into one another and gives examples of such times. He also explains how other debris is created. The article reads, 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russion, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hous, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The historical story he uses helps to prove his points. The end of the article is the persuasive part, telling why all of the facts he has shown us are significant and why space pollution is undeniably a big deal. The article reads, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.' The persuasive techniques he uses leaves us concerned and wondering about how space pollution could affect us.

The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.

First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.

In this article, the author organizes the paragraphs into an introduction mentioning space junk (with humor), a paragraph explaining what space junk is, specific details about crashes that bring to light what COULD happen in the future, a section describing the harmful effects of tiny debris, and finally a paragraph that explains how the effects are increasing and how nations are working together to come up with a 'viable solution to space polllution.' This organization technique is common in information essays. First, the problem is introduced, and from there the problem is discussed with background information, statistics, comparisons, analogies, and inferences.

They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.	The author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction.

The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.

That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.

The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.

He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.

The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.

The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.

The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot.

The author organizes the article in a way to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughly and make it easier to understand. The author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag (paragraphs 1 and 2). The author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how 'the human race's great space invasion' started it all (paragraph 4). Next, the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit (paragraph 5). The author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that 'bits of space debris present a very serious problem' because 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft' (paragraph 9). Finally, the author tells how agencies are looking for 'an easy solution to the problem of space junk'. This ends the article by emphasizing the importance of this problem.

The author organizes the article into four sections. The first section, 'Orbiting Junk,' acts as an introduction that hooks the readers interest, making them want to read more about space debris and how it occurs. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' goes into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place. The next section, 'Crash Course,' explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisions.The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' relates back all the information about 'space junk' back to the reader, explaining it's signifigance and why the reader should care.

The author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener. It wasn't something i expected, but obviously something i needed to know, since it is currently a concern to government space agencies.     The second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is. It tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above Earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely. Now, once this piece of high-teck space object 'dies' it become one more piece of junk added to space, which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner.     Then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another. The effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space. But those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere, any object that are released into space become free-orbiting satellites. So are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open.     The last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem. Those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second! That is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there, if one of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easily go strait through it, or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult. Never fear though, scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris, and they ended up just giving them different code names, and keeping a radar on them at all times, that way they know the safety zones for whats good, and whats bad.

It's basically like a debate, and this was his side of things. He got the information used to show that it is a problem, out there or Earth too, like it said, if it got into our atmosphere, it could seriously do some damage, falling materials all over could wipe out millions of people.      It's also not healthy for the enviroment of Earth and Space either. The earth could have some more junk all over, and if there is junk in pace then it could come really polluted up there, who knows how much of our things is hurting everyone.

The author first starts out with an introduction which informs us of what the article is about. The author then goes in to a sublevel which tells us of what space junk is. The author says that it is stuff that is lost in space and becomes a free roaming satellite. The author then goes into a different sublevel called crash course. This warns us of what could happen when the space junk gets released. The last sublevel is called little bits, but a big deal. This sublevel tells us that space junk is quite small but it is very dangerous because it flies at a rate of 5 miles per second.

The organization is from past to present. He first tell you about the orbiting of space an what is out thier. Then he calls it junk because sometimes the stuff they lost or put in space becomes very dangerous to the planet but no one knows. The reason why because if you tell people the truth they wouldnt know how to handle it or how to act when you tell them. Some people over exzagerate the problem and cause all kinds of confusion. Space is a dangerous place to enter and play around with. There is no gravity or oxygen to provide, unless your on a spaceship. Most times space ships are not even safe. Some people can not handle moving slow or seeing things they have never seen before.   He was telling about the spaceship that was first launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union but it was artificial and the the United States followed suit. Whicha began the human race's great space invation. Thing like that causes confusion to everyone who can not ake it. He also was giving information about the variety of spacecrafts their was and about the global communicaton an how they launch spaceships. He kept it plan an simple and to the point how distrutive people are to their world and even to outerspace that is most dangerous to the earth.   In conclusion, the fact that the matter is. No matter how big, small, tiny or larger objects are it is so dangerous to people an the earth and it's surroundings. It could cause major damage to people and the earth if it falls straight out from the sky.

The author organized this article in a very specific, yet unique style.  Instead of combining the article into one, the author put everything into a category.  One category can simplify the understanding of the text.  As the reader reading one category at a time helps with reading comprehension.     Perhaps the author had no clue as to how to combine everything into one, or had too much information to combine it all into one.  The first 'category' acts as an introduction while the second 'category' acts as the main story.  Yes, the author could have organized the article in a different way, but he stood out and made the text easier to understand.  I strongly believe that the author did this to get the reader drawn into the story.	The author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction.
