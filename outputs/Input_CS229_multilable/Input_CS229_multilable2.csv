Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.

Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.

This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.

Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.

a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.

3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times.

In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy.

If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.	1
a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags.

In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/.

The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time.

My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.

Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight.

Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.

A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.

a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.

I conclude that plastic type A has the most stretchability because from T1 to T2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh. Another improvent needs to be in step 5.

In the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability. In this experiment, plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. The results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment.

"a) Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B has the highest stretchability i.e lasticity. This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only "" measuring the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"".

In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer.

A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results.

A conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic B has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2.5mm more than any of the other plastics. However, based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable. One way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control, for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic, to ensure that the independent variable, the plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the amount the plastic stretches.

According to this student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchable of the types tried. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the data keeps accurately valid. The experiment design was poor. One way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, are the tight, etc. Another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials.

In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.

a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid.
