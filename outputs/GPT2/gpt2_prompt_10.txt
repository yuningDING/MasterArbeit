A non-gray background consists of a set of colors that have different values for the same value. For example, if you have a dark gray background, you might want to try to find the value that matches the color of the black background. If the color of the dark gray background is black, then the value that matches the value of the dark gray background is black, and vice-versa.  A non-gray background allows you to specify the color that a specific color should match. The default value for this value is 0."
